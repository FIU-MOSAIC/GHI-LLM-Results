21,37218,30,14,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES‑D = 24 (Z ≈ +1.11), a construct positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.29).  
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI trait = 49 (Z ≈ +0.76), also positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.32).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (Z ≈ +1.52), a relatively strong indicator linking to higher PSS.  
- Objective sleep/circadian strain: short median sleep (6 h 1 min, Z ≈ -1.45), very late median sleep onset (~03:56 AM), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63), some intradaily fragmentation — all align with stress-linked profiles.  
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevation (late-night HR above mesor) suggesting nocturnal arousal.  
- Low physical activity (no regular exercise), a behavioral correlate of higher stress.

Reasons Participant 1 that mitigate very high PSS
- No alcohol or recreational drug use (protective).  
- Above-average academic performance (GPA 3.76) and some social/leisure engagement.  
- Some circadian stability (interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation above mean).  
Overall inference in their cohort: above-mean but likely modestly elevated PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD‑7 = 12 (Z ≈ +0.46) — but crucially GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77), so even a moderate elevation is highly predictive of higher PSS.  
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 17.5 (Z ≈ +1.32), also correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).  
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: large overnight HR deviations (e.g., 12–1am z ≈ +1.02) that correlate positively with PSS, indicating disturbed overnight recovery.  
- Low self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association to PSS (r ≈ -0.66).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24) that correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.68).  
- Elevated substance‑abuse subscale (z ≈ +1.5) — may reflect behavioral/psychosocial risk even if its direct correlation with PSS here is negligible.

Reasons Participant 2 that mitigate very high PSS
- Objective sleep duration is adequate (≈7 h 19 min, z ≈ +0.66) and stable.  
- Lower resting HR (z ≈ -0.64), preserved circadian amplitude and autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.35 and +0.64), and lower pain/activity interference (z ≈ -1.1) — physiological and somatic signals that argue against extreme stress.

Comparative weighting and conclusion
- Both participants are characterized as above their cohort means, but the predictive strength of the elevated measures differs. Participant 1’s strongest elevations are PSQI (Z ≈ +1.52) and CES‑D (Z ≈ +1.11), but those measures have only modest correlations with PSS in that sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; PSQI correlation smaller than the anxiety→PSS link in Participant 2). Participant 1 also has several notable protective signals (no substance use, good GPA, decent interdaily stability).  
- Participant 2’s elevated anxiety (GAD‑7) and emotional‑lability measures have much stronger empirical links to PSS in that cohort (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77; BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.68). Participant 2 also shows objectively elevated nocturnal HR with moderate positive correlations to PSS. Although Participant 2 has some physiological protections (adequate sleep duration, lower RHR), the combination of a strongly PSS‑linked anxiety signal, very poor subjective sleep, nocturnal autonomic arousal, and reduced self‑efficacy provides a concentrated, high‑impact pattern pointing toward higher perceived stress relative to their cohort mean.  
- Taking effect sizes and the strength of correlations into account, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- High depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33, Z = 2.05) — a large deviation from the sample mean; depression correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.27).
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83), indicating severe perceived sleep problems that commonly co-occur with greater perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) and low current happiness (Z = -1.61) — affective signals that align with higher PSS.
- Wearable-derived signals consistent with increased arousal/fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = 0.81, resting HR Z = 0.65) that have modest positive associations with PSS in this sample.
- Several small-to-moderate sample correlations link these measures to PSS, providing convergent psychological and physiological evidence for above-mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 14.5, Z ≈ 0.9) with a very strong sample-level correlation to PSS (r = 0.80) — this is a high-weight indicator.
- Marked objective sleep disruption: extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 min, Z = -1.04), very late/variable sleep timing (start-time SD Z = 1.16), plus PSQI = 13. Sleep measures (objective and subjective) correlate moderately with PSS (PSQI r = 0.49).
- Strong physiological signs tied to stress: high resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.23) — these circadian/HR features are closely linked to higher PSS in the summary.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (+8–9 bpm at midnight–2 AM) that have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42), indicating nighttime physiological arousal.
- Elevated emotional lability and pain-related interference (BASIS-24 and PEG-3) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.66 and r ≈ 0.47, respectively).
- Few protective signals (modest self-efficacy Z = 0.12), but these appear insufficient to offset the strong anxiety, sleep, pain, and physiological signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective population means. The strength and relevance of indicators differ, however.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 3.83) and high depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 2.05). However, several protective/mitigating factors are present (long, stable objective sleep duration Z = 1.22; regular exercise Z = 1.07; social time Z = 0.95; low substance use), and many physiological correlations with PSS are modest in size.
- Participant 2 shows a broader set of convergent, high-weight indicators that map strongly onto PSS in their sample: anxiety with a very large sample correlation (GAD-7 r = 0.80), objectively very short and irregular sleep with moderate PSQI–PSS correlation (r = 0.49), pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian flattening (large Zs for resting HR, amplitude, IS, IV), and pain/emotional-lability measures that correlate substantially with PSS. The summary explicitly notes strong sample-level associations for several of these measures, increasing confidence that they reflect elevated perceived stress in that cohort.
- In short, Participant 1 has some severe subjective distress indicators but also meaningful behavioral and objective protective factors; many of their physiological correlates with PSS are modest. Participant 2 exhibits multiple, strongly correlated stress indicators (anxiety, disrupted objective sleep, nocturnal HR elevation, circadian disruption, pain, emotional lability) with larger effect sizes and stronger sample correlations, and fewer offsetting protective factors.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Given the relative strength of indicators and the sample-level correlations reported, Participant 2’s profile is more strongly and consistently tied to higher perceived stress within their study population than Participant 1’s profile is within theirs.
- Therefore, Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) compared with Participant 1, when each is judged relative to their own sample mean.

24,98760,33,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s cohort):
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; classified as disturbed sleep; z = 1.05), which correlates positively with PSS in this sample.
- Late median sleep-start time (~01:58 AM) and high sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 102 min), which can worsen perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily variability (0.67, z ≈ 0.88) indicating circadian/behavioral fragmentation associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (notably 6–9 PM; z up to ≈ 2.9) suggesting incomplete downregulation that could increase subjective stress.
- Low behavioral social engagement (z ≈ -1.41), a psychosocial vulnerability that can be associated with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s cohort):
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; z ≈ 1.51). GAD-7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74), making this a powerful predictor of higher PSS.
- Extremely poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5; z ≈ 1.65), and PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z ≈ 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63), which is associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS), both correlated with higher PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.44) which, given its negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.66), suggests reduced coping resources and higher perceived stress.
- Some wearable signs of arousal at sleep-opportunity times (late-evening HR deviations) that could exacerbate subjective sleep complaints.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame):
- Participant 1’s risk signals are mainly sleep/circadian fragmentation and low socializing, but these are offset in the profile by several strong protective factors (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem/happiness, frequent exercise, low resting HR, high circadian amplitude). The integrated interpretation in the description places Participant 1 at or slightly below their cohort mean (population mean PSS = 21.62).
- Participant 2’s subjective measures (especially severe anxiety and very poor sleep) are multiple, large, and tied to PSS by strong correlations—these subjective signals are explicitly described as outweighing the protective objective physiology. The study interpretation places Participant 2 above their cohort mean (population mean PSS = 20.54).

Weighting the balance of evidence:
- Participant 2 shows convergent, strong self-report indicators that are both large in magnitude and highly correlated with PSS (notably GAD-7 and PSQI). Participant 1 shows mixed signals with stronger protective psychological markers and only moderate risk markers. Thus, despite some objective resilience in Participant 2, the strength and convergence of their subjective risk indicators make it substantially more likely that Participant 2’s PSS is higher relative to their cohort than Participant 1’s is relative to theirs.

23,67192,17,31,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Clinically-significant subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (well above the cutoff) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48).  
- Very short objective sleep duration and irregular timing: median sleep ≈ 4 h 21 min and large sleep-start SD (~123 min). Short/irregular sleep often associates with higher perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: positive overnight heart-rate deviations around midnight–2 AM (+12 to +15 bpm; z > 1) with the 1–2 AM deviation moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).  
(These signals push toward higher PSS, but their correlations with PSS are moderate and are counterbalanced by stronger daytime/trait protective markers in this sample.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: high depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 32; z ≈ 1.95) and high trait anxiety (STAI = 58; z ≈ 1.65). Both correlate positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.27 and 0.31) and are among the strongest predictors of higher PSS.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 and late/variable sleep onset (median ~01:15 AM, substantial night-to-night variability), which are associated with higher PSS.  
- Elevated tonic/evening cardiac activation: high mesor (z ≈ 2.01), elevated resting HR (z ≈ 1.62), and pronounced evening HR deviations (+16.3 bpm at 10–11 PM; z ≈ 1.55). These physiological elevations support a stress-prone profile when combined with mood symptoms.  
(Protective signals exist—adequate objective sleep duration, good interdaily stability, social support—but do not outweigh the strong mood/anxiety and physiological arousal indicators.)

Comparative reasoning and balance of evidence
- Both descriptions are given relative to their own population means (PSS means ~21.2 and ~21.6, respectively). Participant 1 is inferred to be below their population mean; Participant 2 is inferred to be above theirs.  
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s strongest signals favoring lower PSS are very low anxiety (GAD‑7 z ≈ −1.29) and higher self-efficacy—measures that have strong correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77, NGSE r ≈ −0.65). These strong protective signals likely outweigh Participant 1’s moderate sleep-related risk signals.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple co-occurring strong risk signals (high depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both with meaningful correlations to PSS, plus elevated tonic/evening cardiac tone). Although some objective sleep and circadian metrics are protective, the magnitude and convergence of mood/anxiety and physiological arousal provide stronger evidence for above-mean perceived stress in their sample.  
- Overall, the net evidence indicates Participant 2 more clearly aligns with elevated perceived stress relative to their population than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.

22,17020,10,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean = 21.5)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83) — PSQI has a moderate-to-strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.58) in this sample, so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Wearable sleep metrics suggesting very short median sleep (1 h 44 min, Z = -1.24) and irregular sleep start times (SD ≈ 160 min) — these objective signals align with the PSQI and are associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 avg 7.78, PAPAS composite Z ≈ 0.8), which moderately correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56) and push perceived stress upward.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal that correlate positively with PSS (small-to-moderate correlations).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.61)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) plus markedly late average sleep onset (~02:12) and high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 108 min) — late/irregular sleep timing and variability are associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.67), indicating greater fragmentation of activity/arousal, a known positive correlate of PSS in the sample.
- Low social and recreational engagement, elevated internet use, and lower momentary happiness — behavioral/lifestyle patterns that commonly co-occur with greater perceived stress.
- Circadian attenuation (reduced amplitude Z = -1.21 and very low MESOR Z = -1.95) consistent with disrupted circadian physiology that can associate with higher perceived stress.

Comparative within-population reasoning
- Both descriptions are relative to different sample means and each participant is characterized as mildly above their cohort mean rather than extreme outliers. Participant 1’s write-up explicitly characterizes the inferred PSS as near the population mean with a “modest uplift” from sleep and pain; Participant 2’s write-up explicitly concludes a “mildly elevated” PSS (slightly above the population mean).
- Strength and balance of predictors: Participant 1 has very strong protective signals (very low GAD-7; high self-efficacy; low emotional lability; robust circadian structure; lower resting HR) that are associated with substantially lower PSS in this sample (notably GAD-7 and NGSE have large sample correlations with PSS). Those protective factors are judged to offset much of the elevated sleep/pain signal, yielding an overall near-mean inference.
- Participant 2’s risks are more multi-domain behavioral/circadian (late/irregular sleep, intradaily fragmentation, social withdrawal, lower momentary well-being). Although Participant 2 also has protective signs (low RHR, adequate median sleep duration, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem), the summary places more weight on behavioral/circadian dysregulation as drivers that produce a net mild elevation above that study’s mean.
- Relative magnitude: Participant 1’s strongest upward drivers are concentrated in sleep and pain but are counterbalanced by strong psychological resilience (very low anxiety). Participant 2’s upward drivers are distributed across circadian, behavioral engagement, and subjective well-being; the report explicitly states a mild elevation above the study mean.

Weighting these factors, the balance favors Participant 2 as exhibiting the worse overall perceived stress (i.e., higher PSS relative to their cohort). Participant 1 appears closer to the cohort mean with substantial protective factors that mitigate the sleep/pain risks, whereas Participant 2 shows multiple behavioral and circadian risk signals that the summary judges to produce a mild net elevation above their cohort mean.

- Emotional dysregulation: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z = 0.53) and correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Poor subjective sleep and pain: PSQI = 8.5 (disturbed sleep) and high PEG-3 / PAPAS scores (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z = 1.21); both types of measures show moderate correlations with PSS.  
- Nocturnal/evening physiological arousal: Substantial overnight HR elevations (e.g., +13–14 bpm around midnight–2am, Zs ≈ 1.25–1.36) that are positively associated with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Sleep timing variability/fragmentation: Large night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD ≈ 199 minutes, Z = 0.65), which is associated with worse subjective stress.  
- Integrated interpretation in the report explicitly concludes perceived stress above the population mean, with multiple strong survey correlates and corroborating nocturnal HR signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean = 21.65)
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity and fragmentation: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.07), reduced 24‑hr autocorrelation (Z = −0.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74), and attenuated amplitude (Z = −1.03). These wearable features in the sample modestly associate with higher PSS.  
- Some hourly HR deviations (early‑morning elevations and a pronounced 6–7am peak, Z = 3.07) that modestly correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23), possibly reflecting morning arousal tied to schedule demands.

Comparative considerations within each study’s frame
- Strength and type of indicators: Participant 1’s “higher stress” signals are primarily strong self‑report indices (anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability) with moderate-to-strong correlations to PSS in that sample, plus corroborating nocturnal HR elevations. Participant 2’s “higher stress” signals are primarily wearable circadian irregularities and a morning HR peak; these signals are reported as smaller in effect size and are counterbalanced by many strong protective self‑report indicators.  
- Directional balance: Participant 1’s profile contains multiple robust indicators pointing toward higher PSS and the summary explicitly infers PSS above that sample’s mean. Participant 2’s summary explicitly infers PSS below that sample’s mean, with the higher-stress wearable signals characterized as smaller/modest effects that do not override strong self-report protections (low anxiety and depression, high happiness/health satisfaction, good sleep, high exercise).  
- Population dispersion: Participant 1’s study reports a larger SD (7.51) than Participant 2’s (3.63), but that does not change the relative strength of the individual’s internal evidence: Participant 1 shows clinically meaningful symptom scores (e.g., GAD-7 ≥10) strongly tied to PSS, whereas Participant 2 shows strong low-anxiety and high-wellbeing self-reports.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The preponderance and strength of indicators pointing to elevated perceived stress are substantially greater for Participant 1 (multiple moderate-to-strong self‑report predictors and corroborating nocturnal HR arousal) than the relatively modest wearable-derived signals that could point to higher stress for Participant 2 (which are outweighed by very strong protective self‑report signals).  
- Therefore Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher PSS (greater perceived stress), within the respective-study frames provided.

- Trait anxiety: STAI = 41 (near anxious range) and STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), so anxiety could elevate perceived stress.
- Low momentary positive affect: very low self-rated happiness (Z ≈ -1.61), which correlates negatively with well‑being and modestly with PSS.
- Sleep timing and quantity: late sleep onset (~01:50) and below‑mean sleep duration (median ≈ 6 h 46 m, Z ≈ -0.51) can impair coping and raise perceived stress.
- Some fragmentation: slightly elevated intradaily heart-rate/activity variability (Z ≈ 0.32) which has a small positive correlation with PSS.
- Behavioral patterns: high video‑game time (Z ≈ 1.71) and limited reading could reflect coping behaviors associated with stress for some people.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Pronounced subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = 1.0) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Extreme objective sleep deficits/irregularity: median nightly sleep ~2 h 38 m (Z ≈ -0.94), very late median sleep start (03:12 AM), high night‑to‑night onset variability (Z ≈ 1.3)—strong contributors to perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart‑rate deviations (Z up to ≈ 1.59) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety: GAD‑7 = 10 (moderate anxiety) and anxiety measures have a very strong positive association with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78).
- Pain‑related interference: PAPAS elevated and pain correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Circadian dysregulation: low interdaily stability and low 24‑h autocorrelation (negative Zs) and higher intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.92), consistent with higher stress when combined with poor sleep.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- The description for Participant 1 concludes their PSS is likely near-to-slightly-below their study mean (21.63). Key protective signals (strong interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.91, high 24h autocorrelation Z ≈ 0.98, low resting HR Z ≈ -1.18, frequent exercise) are weighed as outweighing the modest subjective signals pointing upward.
- The description for Participant 2 concludes their PSS is likely above their study mean (20.75). Several strong, converging signals tied to higher PSS are present: objectively and subjectively very poor sleep, nocturnal physiological arousal, and moderate anxiety—each is reported to have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample.
- The strengths of association matter: Participant 2’s elevated GAD‑7 and sleep disturbance are tied to relatively large correlations with PSS in their sample (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78 and PSQI r ≈ 0.47), whereas many of Participant 1’s stress‑raising signals (e.g., intradaily variability, STAI) have smaller correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 1 also shows multiple physiological/circadian markers that are robustly protective (high interdaily stability and low RHR with negative or small correlations with PSS).

Overall balance and decision
- Participant 2 shows multiple, strong, and convergent risk indicators (severe objective short sleep and irregularity, high PSQI, nocturnal HR arousal, and moderate anxiety with strong PSS association) and is explicitly judged above that study’s mean PSS.
- Participant 1 shows mixed signals but is explicitly judged near to slightly below their study’s mean PSS, with notable physiological/circadian resilience that likely offsets their modest subjective distress.

7,89142,15,0,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from the description)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; z = +0.67). PSQI has a moderately strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.53), so this is a salient stress-related signal.
- Very short wearable sleep (median 4 h 22 min) and large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = +0.89) and sleep onset (SD z ≈ +0.34). Short, irregular sleep patterns are commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = +2.34), which is a large deviation that plausibly contributes to ongoing perceived stress for this person.
- Dampened circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude z ≈ −0.84; interdaily stability z ≈ −1.05), which are consistent with disrupted daily structure that often co-occurs with elevated stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from the description)
- Trait anxiety moderately elevated (STAI z = +0.66), and STAI shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.34).
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (z = −2.45), an extreme deviation even if its correlation with PSS is small; large negative health satisfaction is often accompanied by greater perceived stress.
- Short objective sleep (median 5 h 50 min; z = −1.68) with elevated variability (SD z ≈ +0.51), and limited exercise, socializing, and lower happiness (multiple modest negative Zs) — a cluster of lifestyle/psychological factors that together point toward higher perceived stress.
- The overall synthesis in the description explicitly concludes a modest elevation above the study mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1: The profile mixes strong sleep- and rhythm-related risk signals (PSQI r = 0.53 is a relatively strong within-sample predictor) and a very large interpersonal strain deviation, but these are balanced by clear protective indicators (very low current anxiety z ≈ −1.38, low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, low resting HR). The summary explicitly judges the participant to be near the sample mean with a modest tilt above it.
- Participant 2: Multiple moderate risk signals (trait anxiety, very low health satisfaction, objectively short sleep, low exercise/social engagement) combine to produce a clearer net signal of elevated stress in the description, even though several protective metrics are present. The summary explicitly judges the participant to be modestly above the sample mean.
- Population SD context: Participant 1’s study PSS SD is relatively large (SD = 7.42), so modest above-mean positioning in that sample corresponds to a smaller standardized elevation than the same absolute difference would in a sample with smaller SD. Participant 2’s sample has smaller PSS SD (SD = 3.51), so a modest above-mean placement there implies a relatively more notable standardized elevation. This tends to increase the relative weight toward Participant 2 being higher in standardized terms.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Although Participant 1 has some strong individual deviations (very short objective sleep, high PSQI, large interpersonal strain), these are counterbalanced by multiple strong protective signs (very low anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, low resting HR). The study-level summary rates them as near the mean with only a modest tilt above.
- Participant 2 presents several concurrent risk signals (trait anxiety, extreme low health satisfaction, short sleep, low activity/socializing) and the study-level summary rates them as modestly above the mean. Given the smaller PSS SD in Participant 2’s sample, that “modest” elevation likely reflects a more meaningful standardized placement than Participant 1’s modest tilt in a higher-SD sample.
- Overall, the descriptions and their explicit syntheses point to Participant 2 as exhibiting the higher perceived stress relative to their respective study populations.

- Blunted circadian amplitude, low interdaily stability and other rhythm irregularities consistent with disrupted behavioral structure—features that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = 2.34), a salient contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress even if weakly correlated with PSS in the sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean 21.59)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 21, z ≈ 0.8) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z ≈ 0.86); both measures are established correlates of higher PSS in this sample.
- Marginally disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6) and somewhat short median sleep (6 h 46 min), which can contribute to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian/behavioral fragmentation (high intradaily variability z ≈ 1.09, reduced 24‑h autocorrelation z ≈ −0.53, non-trivial sleep timing variability) that is positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ −1.29), which is negatively correlated with PSS and therefore a risk factor for higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both profiles include mixed signals, but they differ qualitatively:
  - Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are sleep-related (very short, highly variable sleep) and pronounced interpersonal strain. However, Participant 1 also shows several strong protective signs against perceived distress (very low current anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self‑efficacy, and low resting HR). The original integrative read concludes a position near the population mean with only a modest tilt above it.
  - Participant 2 shows a consistent cluster of affective risk signals (depression and trait anxiety) plus circadian fragmentation and modest sleep restriction. These are multiple self-report and wearable indicators that directly correlate with higher PSS. Although Participant 2 also has meaningful protections (regular exercise, no substance use, low resting HR, some self-reported happiness), the profile was judged most consistent with a moderate elevation above that population’s mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 has very severe objective sleep disturbance and high interpersonal strain, which are important risk factors for PSS; however, several robust protective signals (especially the very low GAD-7/anxiety and low pain) argue against a large elevation above their sample mean.
- Participant 2 presents a broader, concordant elevation across mood/anxiety symptom measures and circadian fragmentation—multiple domains that directly predict higher PSS—resulting in a more consistently above-mean profile in their study population.

9,18111,12,28,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.6)
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES‑D = 27 (z ≈ +1.42, classified “Depressed”) and STAI‑Trait = 48 (z ≈ +0.66, “anxious”). Both measures correlate positively with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), supporting above‑mean perceived stress.
- Low subjective well‑being: self‑rated happiness is low (z ≈ -1.61), consistent with elevated stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and circadian disruption: PSQI = 8 (disturbed sleep), low circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.48), low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.40), high night‑to‑night variability and frequent naps (naps z ≈ +2.27). These sleep/circadian signals cohere with higher stress in the study.
- Evening physiological arousal: elevated evening HR deviations (8–9pm deviation z ≈ +1.85), suggesting persistent evening arousal that aligns with stress.
- Behavioral correlates: reduced restorative leisure and elevated internet use are patterns that accompany higher stress.
- Overall summary verdict in the profile: the author concludes perceived stress is above the sample mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.42)
- Severe objective and subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 10 (disturbed sleep), very short median nightly sleep (3 h 27 m; z ≈ -0.66), high sleep variability (SD z ≈ +0.62), high intradaily variability (z ≈ +2.29). These sleep metrics are associated with higher PSS in the sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.46; IV r ≈ 0.24).
- Some interpersonal strain: elevated BASIS‑24 interpersonal score (z ≈ +0.94), which could contribute to stress (though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small/uncertain).

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective signals that argue against above‑mean stress)
- Minimal generalized anxiety: GAD‑7 = 4 (z ≈ -0.94). In this sample GAD‑7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.76), so a low GAD‑7 is a strong predictor of below‑mean PSS.
- High self‑efficacy: NGSE z ≈ +0.49, and NGSE is strongly inversely related to PSS in the sample (r = -0.65), favoring lower perceived stress.
- Very low emotional lability (z ≈ -1.67) and low pain scores (PEG‑3 z ≈ -1.28) — both associated with lower or not‑elevated PSS.
- Physiological profile consistent with preserved diurnal amplitude and some HR patterns that, in the sample, associate with lower PSS.

Comparative reasoning (within-frame)
- Both descriptions use nearly identical population means (21.6 vs 21.42), so absolute mean differences are negligible; the comparison rests on the relative strength and number of risk vs protective indicators.
- Participant 1’s strongest indicators of elevated stress are clinically notable elevations in depression and trait anxiety plus disturbed sleep/circadian rhythms and evening physiological arousal. The depression/anxiety signals are direct psychological risk markers for higher PSS (even if their sample correlations are moderate).
- Participant 2’s most severe problems are objective and subjective sleep restriction/fragmentation, which are important risk factors. However, the strongest sample‑level predictors of PSS (GAD‑7 and NGSE) point strongly toward lower perceived stress for Participant 2. In other words, Participant 2 has a strong combination of protective signals with large sample correlations against PSS that outweigh the sleep‑based risk signals (which have moderate correlations).
- Magnitude and direction: Participant 1 shows multiple elevated symptom measures (CES‑D notably high) and converging wearable signs of circadian disruption and evening arousal that the profile author judged to place them above the study mean. Participant 2 is a mixed profile but the dominant, strongly weighted predictors favor below‑mean PSS despite dramatic sleep loss.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress (above their sample mean), while Participant 2 is more likely below their sample mean despite severe sleep problems.

5,89142,14,0,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 48; Z = +0.66). STAI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.34), so this is a relevant risk signal for higher perceived stress.
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45). Although its correlation with PSS is small (r ≈ −0.12), the magnitude of deviation is large and often accompanies higher stress.
- Short and irregular sleep: median nocturnal sleep ~5 h 50 min (Z = −1.68) and elevated night-to-night variability (SD = 123 min; Z = +0.51), patterns commonly linked to increased perceived stress.
- Behavioral/lifestyle risks: minimal reported exercise (Zs ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), and low current happiness (Z ≈ −0.53), which can exacerbate stress.
- Taken together these signals plausibly place this person modestly above the study mean PSS (mean = 21.67), per the provided synthesis.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Severe and irregular sleep: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), wearable median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 4 min, and very large sleep-timing variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). Sleep measures here have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50), and the objective sleep deficits are extreme.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9.0 with very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z = 0.43; r with PSS ≈ 0.68). These are highly weighty indicators of higher perceived stress.
- Substance-related problems (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75) and some pain interference (measures that correlate positively with PSS), both of which tend to raise perceived stress.
- Circadian/physiological instability: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.42), low amplitude (Z = −1.10), and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (Z = −0.68), metrics associated with greater stress and poor sleep.
- These convergent, strongly PSS-correlated signals lead the provided synthesis to place this participant above the study mean PSS (mean = 21.33).

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weight of evidence
- Strength and directness of stress-linked signals: Participant 2 shows multiple strong, converging indicators that in their sample have high correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78, emotional lability r ≈ 0.68, PSQI r ≈ 0.50). The objective sleep deficit for Participant 2 (median ≈ 3 hours) is extreme and aligns with severe elevation in inferred PSS.
- Participant 1’s indicators of higher stress are present but milder: STAI is only moderately elevated (Z +0.66) and its correlation with PSS in that sample is moderate (r ≈ 0.34); the very low health satisfaction is notable in magnitude but has a small correlation with PSS in that dataset. Several protective signals (good subjective sleep quality, circadian stability, low resting HR, no substance use, low depressive symptoms) substantially attenuate the inferred stress for Participant 1.
- Participant 2 does have meaningful protective signals (high general self-efficacy, lower resting HR/mesor), but these appear insufficient to fully offset the severity and PSS-relevance of the sleep disruption, anxiety, emotional lability, and substance-related problems.
- Considering the relative sizes of signals, their documented correlations with PSS in each study, and the overall balance of risk vs. protective features within each population frame, Participant 2’s profile implies a higher degree of perceived stress than Participant 1’s profile.

5,64232,14,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean = 21.33)
- Severe and convergent sleep disturbance: very high PSQI (13.5, “Disturbed Sleep”), objectively very short median sleep (~3 h/night) and extreme sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD Z = 2.82). These sleep variables have substantial positive correlations with PSS in the sample and are especially extreme here.
- Elevated anxiety and emotional lability: GAD-7 = 9.0 and BASIS-24 emotional lability (Z = 0.43); GAD-7 and emotional lability have strong positive correlations with PSS (noted r values are large), pushing inference upward.
- Substance-related difficulties and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse (Z = 1.75) and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS, adding to stress burden.
- Circadian rhythm disruption: reduced interdaily stability, low amplitude, and reduced 24-hr autocorrelation (several Zs negative) that align with higher stress in the sample.
- Weighing these, several of the strongest PSS-correlated measures (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, circadian instability) point toward above-mean perceived stress.
- Protective factors that moderate but do not eliminate the signal: very high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79) and relatively low resting HR/mesor (Z ~ -0.55, -0.66), suggesting resilience but likely insufficient to offset the severe sleep/anxiety/substance signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean = 21.6)
- Trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance: STAI = 44 (Z = 0.27) and PSQI = 8 (Z = 0.59), both positively associated with PSS in the dataset.
- Marked circadian irregularity: very low interdaily stability (Z = -1.56) and sizable sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.48), which in this sample associate with higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness and small reductions in self-esteem (Zs negative) that align with higher stress.
- Some physiological signs: elevated evening/night HR deviations and modestly higher MESOR (Z = 0.46) suggesting higher daily cardiovascular tone.
- Protective factors that substantially temper the elevation: long median nightly sleep (8 h, Z = 1.01), frequent sports participation (Z = 1.58), essentially no naps (Z = -0.86), normal depressive symptoms and typical resting HR — all associated with lower PSS or resilience in this sample.

Comparative evaluation (within each study’s frame)
- Strength and extremity of indicators: Participant 1 shows more extreme and convergent high-PSS signals (very short objective sleep, very high PSQI, strong anxiety correlation, elevated substance problems). Many of these measures have large correlations with PSS in that study and several Z-scores are large (e.g., sleep timing variability Z = 2.82, substance abuse Z = 1.75).
- Participant 2 shows a mixed profile with some higher-stress indicators (circadian irregularity, modestly elevated trait anxiety and PSQI) but also several strong protective markers (long nocturnal sleep, frequent sports, low nap rate). The high-stress indicators are generally less extreme than Participant 1’s (PSQI and anxiety elevations are modest; objective sleep duration is actually well above mean).
- Both descriptions conclude “above the population mean,” but the magnitude and concentration of high-stress signals are considerably greater for Participant 1 than for Participant 2 when judged by (a) extremity of sleep impairment, (b) strong anxiety/substance signals, and (c) multiple measures with robust positive correlations to PSS.

Decision
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",5,Pain,14,64232,NetHealth,27
10,39146,10,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (“Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42), so perceived poor sleep could elevate PSS for this individual.
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations: certain early-morning HR values show larger negative deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These nocturnal cardiovascular patterns could modestly associate with higher perceived stress.
- Discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep: objectively adequate sleep duration but subjective complaints—this mismatch is often linked to distress and could contribute to elevated perceived stress even when many objective metrics look good.

(Also note strong evidence against high PSS: very high self-efficacy, minimal anxiety, low emotional/interpersonal distress, strong circadian stability, very low resting HR — all argue strongly for below-mean PSS.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Elevated physiological arousal: higher resting heart rate (RHR Z = 0.86) and higher mean HR mesor (Z = 0.61); these correlate positively (albeit modestly) with PSS in the sample.
- Intraday fragmentation: intradaily variability above average (Z ≈ 0.53), linked to higher PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Sleep timing and shorter sleep: late median sleep start (01:32) and somewhat short median sleep duration (6 h 48 min, Z = -0.47) — both often associated with higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary positive affect: current happiness below mean (Z ≈ -0.53), which correlates with higher PSS.
- Daytime HR elevations: pronounced daytime HR increases (despite preserved nocturnal recovery) that can reflect greater daytime autonomic activation/allostatic load.

(Also note multiple buffers against high PSS: good subjective sleep (PSQI = 5), high circadian regularity, higher self-esteem, low depressive symptoms, consistent functioning — these push inferred PSS toward the mean or slightly below.)

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes their profile is most consistent with perceived stress below their study’s mean (population mean PSS = 21.5). This conclusion rests on very strong signals (maximum self-efficacy, minimal GAD-7, very low RHR, strong circadian metrics) that have large correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2’s summary explicitly places them near their study’s mean PSS (population mean = 21.61), with mixed signals: modest physiological indicators of greater arousal and intraday variability vs. psychosocial/sleep buffers that pull toward below-mean. The net inference was “near the mean, slightly tending toward below-mean when psychosocial protections are weighted.”
- Because the question asks which participant appears to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study populations, Participant 2’s “near-mean / slight bias toward below-mean” position is closer to higher perceived stress than Participant 1’s clear below-mean placement. Participant 1 shows stronger, higher-weighted protective signals (large-effect correlations like NGSE–PSS and GAD–PSS) that markedly reduce the likelihood of a high PSS relative to peers.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: dominant evidence for lower-than-average perceived stress, with only modest, isolated signals (subjective sleep, some nocturnal HR associations) that could elevate stress.
- Participant 2: mixed profile with several modest risk signals (elevated RHR/mesor, intraday variability, late/shorter sleep, lower momentary happiness) and psychosocial protections; overall placed near the population mean and therefore relatively higher than Participant 1’s below-mean placement.

1,22455,17,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Objective circadian/behavioral markers consistent with higher stress:
  - Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These are modestly positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Shorter and more variable sleep than the cohort (median ~6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33; sleep duration variability Z ≈ +0.94), which have small positive correlations with PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV/internet/music use; TV Z ≈ +2.54) which is weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate elevations (large positive deviations at 5–7 AM) that are physiologically atypical and could reflect early awakenings/physiologic arousal (interpretation uncertain).

Notes on strength: these are primarily wearable/behavioral signals with modest sample-level correlations to PSS. They are contrasted by multiple robust self-report indicators of low stress (very low trait anxiety, good well-being, high health satisfaction), so overall the description concludes Participant 1 is likely below their sample mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Large, high-impact sleep disturbances:
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5; classified “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI r ≈ 0.48 with PSS).
  - Extremely short and shifted objective sleep (median nightly sleep ~3 h 30 min; median sleep start ~03:37 AM) — large abnormality.
  - Nocturnal heart-rate elevations across late-night/early-morning hours (hourly Zs up to ~0.67) that correlate with higher PSS (up to r ≈ 0.43 at 1–2 AM).
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (~0.5).
- Reduced circadian robustness (lower amplitude Z ≈ -0.34; reduced 24-h autocorrelation), consistent with higher-stress profiles.
- These sleep, pain, and nocturnal-arousal signals are described as convergent and of moderate-to-strong sample-level association with PSS.

Countervailing factors: low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -0.85) and high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86) are strong protective signals (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.64), but the summary judges that they do not fully offset the large sleep/pain/nocturnal-arousal abnormalities.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as likely below their study’s mean PSS (21.59). The strongest, most PSS-relevant predictors in their profile (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, self-rated happiness/health) are substantially more favorable than the cohort and have direct correlations with PSS, so the net inference is below-mean stress despite some wearable signs of circadian disruption.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as likely above their study’s mean PSS (21.21). Several of the most PSS-relevant indicators (disturbed subjective sleep, objectively very short/late sleep, elevated pain, nocturnal physiological arousal) are large, concordant, and have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that cohort. Although Participant 2 has strong protective self-report factors (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy), the summary judges the risk signals outweigh those protections.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed but weighted toward lower perceived stress relative to their sample mean (protective self-report signals are strong and directly related to PSS; wearable signals are smaller/modest).
- Participant 2: mixed but weighted toward higher perceived stress relative to their sample mean (large, concordant, and PSS-relevant abnormalities in sleep, pain, and nocturnal physiological arousal).

- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45) — although its correlation with PSS is small (r ≈ −0.12), the large negative deviation is notable and commonly aligns with higher perceived stress.
- Short and variable objective sleep (median ~5 h 50 min, Z = −1.68; sleep SD Z ≈ +0.51) — short/irregular sleep patterns are frequently associated with elevated PSS.
- Low exercise and limited socializing/happiness (exercise Zs ≈ −1.6 to −1.9; social/happiness Zs around −0.5 to −0.6) — lifestyle features that can amplify stress.
- Synthesis stated by the report: multiple salient risk indicators lead to the inference the participant is “modestly above” the study mean PSS (mean = 21.67).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.47), making this a plausible contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) — these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47) and the participant shows non-trivial scores, suggesting some stress-related burden.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = +1.54) and modestly elevated resting HR/mesor (Z ≈ +1.2) — possible contributors though correlations with PSS are weak-to-modest.

Comparative weighting of evidence (explicitly within each study’s mean frame)
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized in their report as ""modestly above"" their study’s mean PSS (mean = 21.67), supported by several converging risk signals (trait anxiety, very low health satisfaction, short/variable sleep, low exercise/social engagement). Protective signals exist (low depressive symptoms, good subjective sleep rating in PSQI, stable circadian metrics, low resting HR, no substance use) but the net interpretation given was a modest elevation above the sample mean.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as near or slightly below their study’s mean PSS (mean = 21.38). Although there are meaningful risk factors (poor subjective sleep, pain/interference, interpersonal strain), the participant has several strong protective factors—especially high self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.41) which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.63), pronounced circadian regularity (large positive Zs for interdaily stability and autocorrelation), low emotional lability, and minimal substance use. The report concludes these protections likely outweigh the risks, yielding an overall PSS near or slightly below the study mean.

Conclusion (balance of evidence)
- Both descriptions are given relative to their own population means, which are very similar (P1 mean 21.67; P2 mean 21.38). Taking the relative inferences and the strength of signals into account, Participant 1 is likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (modestly above their sample mean) while Participant 2 is likely at-or-slightly-below their sample mean due to strong protective factors.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (Z ≈ +1.52) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample, so this is a notable risk signal.
- Wearable circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.41), low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87), slightly reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −0.40), and modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.17). These indicate fragmented/irregular rhythms that are associated with higher perceived stress.
- Variable sleep timing (SD ≈ 95 min) and slightly elevated naps (Z ≈ +0.82), both positively associated with PSS in this sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (similar magnitude to P1), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Pain and activity interference: PEG-3 (~4.9) and PAPAS (~50) above median; these show moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47) and can elevate perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ +1.54 (reduced perceived social support/relationship difficulties).
- Elevated tonic physiological arousal: resting HR and mesor Z ≈ +1.2 each — potential sign of higher basal autonomic arousal that can accompany stress.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5), though modest, is a risk factor given the strong sample correlation between anxiety and PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Both participants share an important common risk: substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI ≈ 10–10.5). That alone pushes each toward higher inferred PSS relative to their peers.
- Participant 1’s other risk signals are primarily sleep- and circadian-related (irregularity, fragmentation). These are meaningful but modest in standardized effect sizes (Zs around ±0.4–0.9).
- Participant 1 also shows multiple and fairly strong protective signals relative to their sample: low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ −0.66), lower trait anxiety (Z ≈ −0.52), high self‑esteem and happiness (Zs ≈ +1.38 and +1.64), low resting HR/mesor (Zs ≈ −1.48 and −2.08), regular exercise, and good functioning. These protections were judged by the source as sufficient to place overall PSS near or slightly below that sample mean.
- Participant 2 has a stronger mix of both risk and protective factors. Key protections are high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41), very strong circadian regularity/behavioral stability (interdaily stability Z ≈ +2.13, autocorr Z ≈ +1.57, low intradaily variability Z ≈ −1.05), and low emotional lability and substance problems. The NGSE measure is noted to have a relatively large inverse correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ −0.63), making it an important protective factor.
- However, Participant 2’s risks include subjective sleep disturbance (as above), moderate pain/interference (which correlates moderately with PSS), notable interpersonal strain (BASIS interpersonal Z ≈ +1.54), and elevated resting HR/mesor (Zs ≈ +1.2) — multiple distinct domains that can each increase perceived stress.
- Relative strength comparison: Participant 1’s protective psychosocial and physiological profile appears broader and more consistent (multiple positive mood/trait indices plus low resting HR and good functioning) and was rated as outweighing the sleep/circadian risks. Participant 2’s strongest protective factors (high NGSE and exceptional circadian regularity) are substantial, but they coexist with multi-domain risks (pain, interpersonal strain, elevated physiological arousal) beyond sleep alone.
- Both final integrated judgments in the source texts place each participant near their study mean PSS and likely slightly below it. Comparing the two, however, Participant 2 carries additional non-sleep risk domains (pain, interpersonal strain, higher resting HR) that are not present for Participant 1, while Participant 1 has a broader set of positive mood/health indicators (low depression/anxiety, high happiness/self‑esteem, very low resting HR).

Overall inference
- Taking the balance of within-population evidence, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their own sample) than Participant 1, because P2’s sleep problems are accompanied by additional risk domains (pain interference, interpersonal strain, elevated tonic arousal) while P1’s non-sleep indicators are predominantly protective.

- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated hourly night HR (+10.24, +7.34, +4.18 bpm across 1–4 AM) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone: resting HR z = 1.37 and mesor z = 1.18, consistent with sustained arousal or reduced recovery.
- Marked sleep timing/variability (very long median sleep, z = 2.26; large night-to-night variability z = 2.38) that suggest dysregulated rest/recovery (even if wearable sleep metrics correlate weakly with PSS in this sample).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Wearable circadian irregularity and fragmentation: low interdaily stability z = −1.07, reduced 24‑h autocorrelation z = −0.87, and elevated intradaily variability z = 0.74 — these features modestly associate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Attenuated HR amplitude (z = −1.03) and some early-morning HR elevations (e.g., pronounced 6–7am peak) that have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23).

Comparative reasoning (accounting for within-population frames)
- Participant 1 is described as near their population mean PSS (mean = 20.96) but with several domain-specific signals (sleep disturbance, emotional lability, nocturnal and resting HR elevations) that tend to push perceived stress upward relative to peers. These signals include some moderate positive z-scores and physiological markers that strongly correlate with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is described as below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.65) with multiple robust, concordant protective self-report indicators (trait anxiety z = −1.71, CES‑D z = −1.07, happiness and health satisfaction strongly positive, good subjective sleep, frequent exercise) and lower resting HR. The wearable circadian irregularities that point toward higher stress are present but are smaller in magnitude and have only modest associations with PSS in that study.
- Comparing the balance of evidence within each participant’s population: Participant 2’s profile has multiple strong self-report and behavioral buffers against perceived stress and several z-scores well below the sample mean for anxiety/depression. Participant 1’s profile shows several clear, domain-specific risk signals for higher perceived stress and fewer strong protective self-report signals (though some protective factors exist).

- Elevated physiological arousal: high resting HR and mesor (resting HR Z = 1.53; mesor Z = 1.49) consistent with sustained stress-related activation.
- Wearable sleep summary suggests very short, late, and irregular sleep (median ~2.5 h, late start, high variability), reinforcing the subjective sleep disturbance (noting measurement caveats).

- Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective population means. The question is which one likely has the relatively worse (higher) PSS.
- Strength and predictive weight of indicators differ by study: Participant 1 shows strong signals in depressive symptoms and subjective sleep (notably very high PSQI Z), but in that study CES‑D and STAI correlate only modestly with PSS (r ≈ 0.27–0.31). Some objective indicators for P1 are mixed or protective (long objective sleep, regular exercise, social time).
- Participant 2’s top indicators (severe GAD, PSQI, low self‑efficacy, elevated resting HR) are features that, in that study, have large correlations with PSS (GAD r = 0.81, NGSE r = -0.66, PSQI r = 0.51). Even if some wearable sleep metrics may be underestimated, multiple high‑weight predictors converge on elevated stress for P2.
- Participant 1 has notable protective/muting factors (long, regular objective sleep; exercise; social engagement; low substance use) that the summary explicitly says temper but do not fully offset risk. Participant 2 has fewer and weaker mitigating features (some circadian regularity only), and several highly predictive risk markers.
- Given the relative predictive weights (stronger correlations in Participant 2’s study for the observed risk features) and the convergence of multiple high‑weight indicators for P2 (severe anxiety, low self‑efficacy, elevated baseline HR, substantive subjective sleep disturbance), the balance of evidence favors Participant 2 as having the worse overall perceived stress relative to their sample.

2,30453,38,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean):
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z ≈ 2.04) — a strong correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Substantially disturbed sleep both subjectively (PSQI Z ≈ 1.49) and objectively (median nightly sleep extremely short ~3 h 42 min; very high night-to-night variability), which are robust stress amplifiers.
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z ≈ 2.42) and elevated pain/interference (PAPAS/PEG Zs ≈ 2.28), both linked to higher perceived stress.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), which removes a buffering resource and typically increases perceived stress.
- Objective physiological signs consistent with stress-related dysregulation (circadian fragmentation, nocturnal HR elevations that correlate moderately with PSS).
- Although some protective features exist (low substance-use problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), the number and magnitude of high-risk indicators (multiple Zs > |2| and extreme short sleep) weight strongly toward above-mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean):
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ 4.29) — an exceptionally large signal and a known strong correlate of perceived stress.
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.96), both positive predictors of PSS.
- Objective physiological/circadian dysregulation (elevated resting HR/mesor Zs ≈ 1.1 & 0.85, reduced amplitude Z ≈ −0.63, low interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.9, elevated intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.6).
- Late and variable sleep timing and somewhat reduced sleep duration (≈6 h 25 m, Z ≈ −0.96), plus lower self-esteem and lower happiness/health satisfaction — all consistent with above-mean perceived stress.
- Notable protective behaviors (frequent organized exercise, minimal substance use, leisure coping activities) that plausibly mitigate stress and may reduce net perceived-stress elevation.

Comparative reasoning within the population frames:
- Both participants are characterized as having PSS above their respective sample means. Participant 2 has one very extreme subjective-sleep signal (PSQI Z ≈ 4.29) and meaningful depressive symptoms plus elevated basal autonomic markers. However, Participant 2 also has clear behavioral buffers (regular exercise, no substance use) that could attenuate perceived stress.
- Participant 1 displays multiple convergent, large-magnitude risk signals across psychological (severe anxiety, emotional lability, low self-efficacy), somatic (high pain/interference), and objective sleep metrics (very short median sleep, high variability, nocturnal HR arousal). Several of these measures have strong correlations with PSS in the sample (notably GAD-7), and multiple Z-scores exceed ±2, indicating pronounced deviation from their population mean on several stress-relevant domains.
- Taken together, although Participant 2 has an extreme subjective-sleep Z and elevated depression, Participant 1’s combination of severe anxiety, extreme objective sleep restriction, high emotional lability, elevated pain, and low self-efficacy provides a broader and more severe multimodal signal of elevated perceived stress. The protective factors for Participant 2 are also stronger and more behaviorally plausible as stress buffers than those for Participant 1.

15,89142,15,0,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Trait anxiety above sample mean (STAI Z = +0.66). STAI correlates moderately with PSS in that dataset (r ≈ 0.34), so this is a salient risk signal.
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45). Although its correlation with PSS is small (r ≈ −0.12), the magnitude of the deviation is notable and often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Short and variable nocturnal sleep (median ~5 h 50 min, Z = −1.68; sleep SD high). Short/irregular sleep patterns commonly align with greater stress and daytime dysfunction.
- Low exercise (Z ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), and lower subjective happiness (Z ≈ −0.53) — lifestyle factors that can amplify perceived stress.
- Summary: several behavioral/subjective signals point above the sample mean, but many are moderate in size and some (health satisfaction) have weak correlations with PSS.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ +0.67). PSQI correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53), making this a powerful indicator.
- Elevated pain/functional impairment (PAPAS Z ≈ +0.93). PAPAS also shows a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62). NGSE correlates strongly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.69), so this below-average score predicts higher perceived stress.
- Elevated nocturnal heart rate and higher mesor/resting HR (Zs ≈ +0.6–1.4) with night-time HR deviations that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47) — converging physiologic signals tied to higher PSS in this sample.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83) and late acrophase — additional behavioral circadian markers associated with higher PSS.
- Summary: multiple moderately-to-strongly correlated subjective and physiological indicators point toward elevated PSS relative to this study’s population.

Comparative reasoning (accounting for each description being relative to its own population mean)
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population PSS means. That is, each description already frames the individual as having higher-than-average perceived stress in their study sample.
- Strength and relevance of predictors:
  - Participant 2’s elevated indicators (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE, nocturnal HR, mesor, interdaily stability) are both multiple and have relatively strong correlations with PSS in that dataset (several r ≈ 0.5–0.7 and other moderate r ≈ 0.3–0.5). Those factors are direct and consistent predictors of higher PSS in that sample.
  - Participant 1’s risk signals (STAI, short sleep, very low health satisfaction, low exercise/happiness) are meaningful but generally show weaker sample-level correlations with PSS (STAI r ≈ 0.34; health satisfaction r ≈ −0.12; sleep duration/correlations not presented as strongly). Several robust protective/mitigating signals for Participant 1 exist (good subjective sleep quality, low resting HR and MESOR, stable circadian metrics, low depressive symptoms, no substance use), which offset the risk signals.
- Overall balance: Participant 2 presents a larger number of convergent, moderately-to-strongly PSS-associated signals (subjective sleep, pain, self-efficacy, nocturnal HR, circadian irregularity) with fewer and weaker protective features. Participant 1 shows mixed risk and protective features, and several of the strongest biological/behavioral markers actually point toward resilience.

Conclusion
Based on the within-sample evidence and comparative weighting of predictors, Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, above clinical cutpoint) and irregular sleep timing (late sleep start ~00:57, SD ≈ 63 min) — subjective sleep complaints tend to correlate with higher PSS.
- Circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z = -0.74) and mild intradaily fragmentation (IV Z = 0.32); some early‑morning HR deviations show small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).
- Lower recent happiness and health satisfaction (small negative Zs) that co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5, Z = 0.67) with a strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.53).
- High pain / functional interference (PAPAS = 81, Z = 0.93), also strongly correlated with PSS in the sample (r = 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62) and NGSE’s strong negative correlation with PSS in this sample (r = -0.69).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83) and late circadian phase (acrophase ~10:58 PM), which align with the sample patterns for higher PSS.
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Mesor Z ≈ 0.7; RHR Z ≈ 0.61) and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (12–3 AM) that show moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- These physiological and subjective indicators are relatively large in magnitude (several Zs ~0.6–0.9) and are tied to moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Magnitude and correlation strength: Participant 2’s risk signals tend to be larger in Z-score magnitude and tied to stronger sample-level correlations with PSS (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53; NGSE r ≈ -0.69; nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.47). Participant 1’s risk signals are smaller (STAI/CES‑D Zs ~0.2–0.3) and many correlations are modest (r ≈ 0.19–0.31).
- Balance of risk vs. protection: Participant 1 shows notable protective factors (high self‑esteem Z = 1.38, frequent exercise Z > 1.0, healthy resting physiology, adequate sleep duration Z = 0.56, low substance use) that are associated with lower PSS and appear to meaningfully counterbalance their modest risk signals. Participant 2 has some protective features (low GAD-7, long sleep duration, low IV), but these are fewer and some protective indicators (e.g., long sleep duration) contradict the very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5), making the net risk for Participant 2 more coherent and stronger.
- Coherence of signals: Participant 2’s subjective (poor sleep, high pain, low self-efficacy) and physiological signals (elevated nocturnal HR, higher mesor/RHR, low interdaily stability) converge on higher perceived stress. Participant 1’s signals are mixed (some small risk signals, several stronger protective signals), yielding an overall profile closer to the population mean.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple moderately-to-strongly elevated indicators that are tightly linked to PSS in that study (larger Zs and larger correlations), and these indicators converge on an above-mean PSS inference.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators are smaller in magnitude and are substantially offset by strong protective factors; the summary explicitly judged them “near the mean, possibly slightly above.”
- Therefore, on balance and within each study’s own comparison frame, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress).

- Elevated sedentary/screen time (very large positive Zs for gaming, TV, internet) — may reduce active coping and social interaction and modestly correlate with higher PSS in the sample.  
- Low social-trust score (Z = −2.39) — could reflect lower perceived social support and interpersonal strain, which can increase perceived stress.  
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:04 AM) and low exercise frequency — timing and lack of physical activity can contribute to stress vulnerability.  
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular tonic activation (higher heart-rate mesor/amplitude, resting HR slightly above average) — small positive correlations with PSS suggest a possible link to higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9) — strongly positively correlated with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.59).  
- Anxiety symptoms and emotional lability (GAD-7 = 7.5; BASIS-24 emotional lability = 6.33) — both have very strong positive correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.80; emotional lability r ≈ 0.67), making them powerful predictors of higher perceived stress.  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) — moderately strong positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).  
- Nighttime heart-rate deviations linked to stress — nocturnal HR elevations at specific hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.45).

Comparative reasoning within each study population frame
- Both summaries are explicitly written relative to their own population means: Participant 1 is inferred to be below their study’s mean PSS (21.64), likely near the lower quartile; Participant 2 is inferred to be above their study’s mean PSS (20.75).  
- The strongest, most predictive signals for each participant differ: Participant 1’s very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (large negative Zs) and very regular circadian physiology are robust protective indicators against high PSS in that sample. Participant 2’s elevated self-report measures (anxiety, emotional lability, poor subjective sleep, pain) are strongly and positively correlated with PSS in that sample and are described as primary contributors to higher PSS.  
- Although Participant 1 has several behavioral risk factors (sedentary behavior, low trust, late sleep), these are characterized as weaker predictors in that dataset relative to the very strong protective self-report and circadian signals. Participant 2’s physiological strengths (regular circadian rhythm, consolidated daytime activation, long objective sleep) are described as moderating but insufficient to overcome the potent self-report predictors of higher PSS.

Weighting the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: dominant evidence points to substantially lower perceived stress relative to peers (strong protective self-report and circadian signals outweigh weaker behavioral risk factors).  
- Participant 2: multiple strong, positively correlated self-report indicators (anxiety, emotional lability, poor subjective sleep, pain) point coherently to higher perceived stress relative to peers; wearable-derived protections moderate but do not outweigh those signals.

- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS and reduce coping capacity.  
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), suggesting reduced coping confidence.  
- Objective nocturnal physiological arousal: large overnight HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83) plus late sleep onset (~01:42) and short median sleep (~4h55), supporting a night‑time hyperarousal mechanism tied to higher perceived stress.  
- The combination of strong subjective symptom burden and physiological nocturnal activation provides multiple, convergent high‑stress signals that outweigh the modest protective wearable metrics.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any):
- Modest risk indicators: somewhat short nightly sleep (6 h 52 min, Z ≈ -0.4) and late sleep onset (~01:07), plus minimal solo exercise and little social time—these could reduce stress-buffering behaviors.  
- These features are small in magnitude and have weak correlations with PSS in the sample, so they are cautionary but not strong evidence of higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Participant 1’s elevated-stress indicators are large in effect size and directly correlated with PSS in their study (especially anxiety and sleep disturbance), producing a coherent above‑mean PSS inference relative to their population mean (20.62).  
- Participant 2 shows multiple, convergent protective signals (very low depressive symptoms, below‑mean trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and momentary happiness, strong interdaily stability and very large HR amplitude, low resting HR) and only modest behavioral cautions. Their profile is coherently below their population mean (21.62).  
- The magnitude and directness of Participant 1’s risk signals (clinical‑level anxiety, severe sleep disturbance, high pain, low self‑efficacy, nocturnal HR arousal) are substantially stronger and more PSS‑predictive than the modest risk signs for Participant 2.

11,79167,24,10,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Strong, convergent self-report indicators tied to higher PSS: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16, z = 1.16), high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15), elevated pain interference (PEG‑3 z = 1.18), and emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z = 1.23). Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = −1.55) is strongly associated with higher perceived stress in the sample.
- Wearable physiology corroborates distress: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m, z = −0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low interdaily stability, flattened amplitude (z = −1.4), and very low 24‑hr autocorrelation (z = −1.4). These circadian/sleep disruptions are commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: marked positive hourly HR deviations during typical sleep hours (e.g., 1–2am z = 1.18) that correlate positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.36–0.40), consistent with stress‑related nocturnal arousal.
- Holistic statement in-frame: the summary explicitly concludes perceived stress is above the sample mean (population mean PSS = 20.92, SD = 7.51).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Some wearable circadian metrics indicate features that in this sample are modestly associated with higher PSS: lower interdaily stability (z = −1.07), reduced 24‑hr autocorrelation (z = −0.87), elevated intradaily variability (z = 0.74), and attenuated amplitude (z = −1.03). There are small positive correlations between some hourly HR deviations (e.g., morning peak) and PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23).
- Holistic caveat in-frame: the summary acknowledges these physiological irregularities partially counterbalance self-report protections but judges them smaller in magnitude.

Comparative, within‑frame reasoning (taking each description’s inference relative to its own population mean)
- Participant 1 is inferred to be above their population mean (20.92). The inference is supported by multiple large‑magnitude signals (severe anxiety, very short/late sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, elevated emotional lability, low self‑efficacy) that are each strongly or moderately correlated with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is inferred to be below their population mean (21.65). The inference rests on multiple robust self‑report protections (very low trait anxiety STAI z = −1.71, low CES‑D, high happiness and health satisfaction, good sleep duration and PSQI) and health behaviors (exercise, low substance use). The wearable circadian irregularities that point toward higher PSS are described as smaller in magnitude and not sufficient to override the protective self‑report profile.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Convergence and magnitude: Participant 1 shows convergent, moderately large signals across self‑report and physiology that consistently point to elevated perceived stress. Participant 2 shows a strong, coherent protective self‑report profile and favorable sleep/behavioral markers; only some wearable circadian indices weakly suggest higher stress.
- Uncertainty and confounds: Participant 1 has some ambiguous signals (lower resting HR, possible lifestyle/medication effects) but these do not outweigh the severity and consistency of anxiety, sleep loss, nocturnal arousal, and low self‑efficacy. Participant 2’s circadian fragmentation could reflect schedule variability rather than stress, and overall effect sizes for those associations are modest.
- Considering that each description is relative to its own population mean, the available evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have a substantially higher absolute PSS than Participant 2.

- Convergent subjective signal: multiple high-impact self-report measures point consistently toward above-average perceived stress.
- The profile summary explicitly concludes PSS above the population mean (20.54), with the narrative emphasizing that subjective indicators outweigh protective physiology.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Objectively and subjectively short/irregular sleep:
  - Median nightly sleep ≈ 5 h 55 m (Z = -1.58) and late median sleep start (~02:57 AM) with moderate variability — sleep restriction and irregular timing are commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
  - PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep).
- Some modest physiological risk signals:
  - Slightly reduced circadian amplitude (Z = -0.36).
  - Early-morning HR deviations that correlate positively (small r ≈ 0.19–0.22) with PSS.
- However, these risk signals are smaller in magnitude and/or lower in predictive weight for PSS in this cohort than Participant 1’s large self-report predictors.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s population frame
- Each description is relative to its own cohort mean (P1 mean = 20.54; P2 mean = 21.62). Participant 1 is described as above their cohort mean, driven primarily by very large self-report signals that have strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74 and BASIS-24 r = 0.63). Those are high-impact indicators for PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2’s strongest risk domain is sleep (objective short duration Z = -1.58 and PSQI = 6), but other self-report measures (depression, trait anxiety) are low and positive psychosocial resources (happiness, self-esteem, academic performance) are robust. The narrative concludes PSS near or slightly below that cohort’s mean.
- The magnitudes and predictive weights favor Participant 1: their large, correlated subjective symptom elevations are stronger predictors of elevated PSS than Participant 2’s primarily sleep-related (but otherwise offset) signals.

- Low interpersonal trust (z ≈ −1.42), which can amplify perceived stress; relatively frequent alcohol use (z ≈ 1.68) that may reflect coping behavior.

- Elevated resting heart rate (68.6 bpm; Z ≈ 1.24) and less nocturnal HR suppression, consistent with greater autonomic arousal.
- Marked social withdrawal (in‑person socializing ≈15 min; Z ≈ -2.20) and very high sedentary screen-based leisure — behavioral patterns tied to greater perceived stress and less social buffering.
Moderating/protective features that reduce the likelihood of extreme PSS: objectively adequate sleep duration (median ≈ 7 h 51 min; Z ≈ 0.84), consistent circadian timing (24-h autocorrelation and interdaily stability near/above mean), frequent exercise (Z ≈ 1.07), and minimal substance use.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means (P1: mean 20.33; P2: mean 21.61).
- Magnitude and number of risk signals:
  - Participant 1 shows multiple, convergent high-severity indicators across psychological (severe anxiety, emotional lability), somatic (pain), and objective physiological domains (extreme sleep restriction, circadian fragmentation, nocturnal HR arousal). The objective sleep restriction (≈3h42) is particularly extreme and likely to drive perceived stress severely upward.
  - Participant 2 shows an extremely elevated depressive score (CES‑D Z ≈ 2.99) and very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ 2.9), plus signs of autonomic arousal and behavioral isolation. However, several strong protective/neutralizing signals (adequate objective sleep duration, regular circadian metrics, frequent exercise) argue that some risk factors may be partially buffered.
- Correlations with PSS in the samples matter: Participant 1’s severe anxiety is a strong predictor of PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.71), and several objective sleep/arousal markers for P1 are moderately correlated with PSS. Participant 2’s depression and PSQI are also strongly associated with PSS, but the participant’s adequate objective sleep and regular rhythms are notable mitigators that are absent (or reversed) for Participant 1.
- Overall balance: Participant 1 presents a broader and more physiologically corroborated cluster of severe stress-related features (clinical anxiety + extreme objective sleep loss + circadian disruption + pain + low self-efficacy). Participant 2 has a major affective elevation (depression) and behavioral risk (social withdrawal) but also multiple protective/neutral objective markers that likely moderate perceived stress.

Decision
Given the convergence of severe anxiety, extreme objective sleep restriction and fragmentation, pain, emotion dysregulation, and low self-efficacy in Participant 1 — versus Participant 2’s high depression but partially buffered profile (adequate objective sleep, regular rhythms, exercise) — Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Short sleep duration (median ~5 h 57 m; Z = -1.53) and PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep) — short/poor sleep commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.
- Delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:34) and circadian irregularity (reduced interdaily stability, low 24‑h autocorrelation, elevated intradaily variability) — these wearable-derived features are reported to correlate modestly with higher PSS.
- Evening increases in heart‑rate deviations (7–9 pm) that could reflect later-day physiological arousal linked to delayed sleep onset.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS
- Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51) — very strong predictor of higher PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.75).
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) together with very short sleep (median ≈ 4 h 55 m) and late sleep onset (~01:42) — strong contributors to elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS; Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) — associated with higher PSS.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73) — a robust negative predictor of coping and associated with higher PSS (r ≈ -0.61).
- Nocturnal physiological hyperarousal (large positive hourly HR deviations overnight; some Zs >2.0) — biologically consistent with heightened stress and aligns with symptom reports.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each profile is described relative to its own sample mean: Participant 1 is characterized as near or slightly below their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62), while Participant 2 is described as above their population mean PSS (population mean = 20.62).
- Participant 1’s above‑mean signals are mainly sleep/circadian risk markers (moderate effect sizes), but psychological trait measures (low anxiety/depression, high happiness/self‑esteem) and healthy behaviors (exercise, low substance use, low resting HR) strongly point to lower perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, large, and directly stress‑relevant signals (severe anxiety, extreme subjective sleep disturbance, pain interference, low self‑efficacy, nocturnal HR elevations) with known strong correlations to PSS; circadian regularity metrics mitigate somewhat but do not outweigh the strong symptom/signal pattern.
- Because Participant 2 is explicitly inferred to be above their cohort mean (with strong, high‑Z symptom drivers and physiological corroboration) and Participant 1 is inferred near/below their cohort mean (with stronger protective psychometric signals), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely has the higher overall perceived stress.

- Reduced positive affect/health satisfaction: happiness Z ≈ -0.53 and health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.45 — lower positive affect is associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Small early-morning HR associations: modest positive correlations of heart-rate deviations around 3–6 AM with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21) could reflect subtle physiological arousal related to stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 21 (Z ≈ 2.04) — a very strong predictor of elevated PSS (sample r ≈ 0.71).  
- Very poor sleep: PSQI = 18 (Z ≈ 1.49) and extremely short median sleep (3 h 42 min) with large night-to-night variability — robust correlates and potential causal contributors to high perceived stress.  
- Emotional dysregulation and pain: BASIS-24 emotional lability Z ≈ 2.42 and pain/interference elevated (PEG-3, PAPAS Z ≈ 2.28) — both commonly co-occur with high perceived stress.  
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -2.29 — reduced coping confidence amplifies perceived stress.  
- Objective circadian/sleep fragmentation: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.38), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.15), dampened HR rhythm (amplitude/mesor Z ≈ -0.9 to -1.14), and nocturnal HR deviations that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51) — these wearable markers corroborate high stress and sleep disruption.  
- Although there are protective signs (low substance-use problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), they are smaller in magnitude and do not offset the multiple large-risk signals.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its study’s mean PSS (Participant 1: mean = 21.61; Participant 2: mean = 20.33). Participant 1’s profile is characterized mostly by protective, above-average circadian robustness and healthy behaviors with only modest adverse signals (sleep quality and lower positive affect) — the inference given is near-to-slightly-below the population mean. The effect sizes of risk indicators for Participant 1 are small (Z-scores generally modest, correlations small).  
- Participant 2’s profile shows multiple large-magnitude risk indicators (several Z-scores > |2|, severe anxiety, extreme sleep restriction, high emotional lability and pain), and wearable data that align with substantial circadian/sleep disruption — the inference given is clearly above the population mean. The magnitudes of these risk signals are much larger than those for Participant 1.

Weighing the evidence
- The preponderance and magnitude of risk markers are far greater for Participant 2 than for Participant 1. Participant 1’s stressed indicators are limited in magnitude and offset by multiple robust protective features; Participant 2 shows convergent, large-effect self-report and wearable indicators associated with elevated perceived stress.  
- Therefore, Participant 2 is much more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress) relative to their respective population.

- Behavioral correlates (higher internet use, lower happiness) that align with elevated stress in the sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean of 20.33)
- Very large self‑report elevations tied to stress: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 21; z ≈ +2.04), very poor sleep quality (PSQI = 18; z ≈ +1.49), high emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability z ≈ +2.42), and elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3 / PAPAS z ≈ +2.28).
- Markedly low coping resources: low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −2.29), which is negatively correlated with PSS and thus predicts higher perceived stress.
- Objective sleep/circadian evidence of severe disruption: extremely short median nightly sleep (~3 h 42 min) with high night‑to‑night variability (SD ≈ 173 min), elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.15), low interdaily stability, and dampened HR rhythm (mesor and amplitude z ≈ −1).
- Hourly HR deviations indicating elevated nighttime arousal (positive deviations around 12–2am) that correlate moderately with PSS in that sample.
- Although there are a few protective signs (low substance problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), the magnitude and number of high‑z risk indicators are substantial.

Comparative, within‑sample assessment
- Both participants are inferred above their respective population means. However, Participant 2’s elevations are more numerous and more extreme in z‑score terms across several domains most strongly linked to PSS in their sample (severe anxiety, emotional lability, very short and variable sleep, low self‑efficacy, high pain/interference). Several z-scores for Participant 2 exceed ±2, indicating strong deviation from their sample norms.
- Participant 1 shows meaningful signals of elevated stress (notably depressive symptoms and disturbed sleep) but also several buffering features (regular exercise, reasonable sleep regularity, health satisfaction, not extreme physiological dysregulation). Many of Participant 1’s risk indicators are moderate rather than extreme.
- Because each description is calibrated to its own study mean, we judge relative severity by the magnitude and breadth of deviations within each participant’s sample. Participant 2’s profile contains larger-magnitude, convergent risk signals that more strongly predict higher perceived stress relative to their population than Participant 1’s profile does relative to theirs.

- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11; z ≈ +1.98) and somewhat short median sleep duration (6 h 38 min; z = −0.68), both associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Objective circadian/physiological markers linked to stress: increased intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.60), reduced amplitude/autocorrelation (weaker daily structure), and a pronounced morning heart‑rate surge (hourly deviation z ≈ +2.09) — these features correlate positively, albeit modestly, with PSS.  
- Behavioral/self‑report indicators consistent with strain: high internet use (z = +1.52) and lower reported happiness (z ≈ −0.53).  
- Convergence: multiple independent signals (mood, sleep complaints, and physiological fragmentation) point toward above‑mean stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; “Disturbed Sleep”), which has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) and could raise perceived stress for this participant.  
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate deviations (early‑morning negative deviations with z ≈ −2 to −2.7) that show small‑to‑moderate positive associations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31) in the dataset, suggesting a potential (but modest) link between certain night HR patterns and stress.

Comparative weighing within each population frame:
- Participant 1: multiple moderately to strongly elevated risk indicators for higher PSS (notably CES‑D and PSQI both near z ≈ +2, together with physiological fragmentation and a morning HR surge). Those are several convergent, stress‑related signals; protective factors exist (exercise, lower RHR, sleep regularity), but the number and magnitude of risk signals tilt the balance toward above‑mean perceived stress.  
- Participant 2: the dominant, high‑weight signals point toward lower perceived stress — very high self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +1.79 with strong negative PSS correlation r = −0.60), minimal generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 z ≈ −1.38; r with PSS = +0.75), very low resting HR (z ≈ −2.23), and robust circadian stability/amplitude (z ≈ +1.8–1.9). The main countervailing evidence is a modest PSQI elevation and some nocturnal HR patterns, which are weaker and fewer than the strong protective signals.  
- Because each description is relative to its own cohort mean, the relevant comparison is that Participant 1 is inferred above their cohort mean while Participant 2 is inferred below theirs. The strength and multiplicity of P1’s risk signals (including two near‑z≈+2 self‑report elevations) exceed the relatively isolated, weaker risk signals in P2.

  - Severe generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ +1.51) and GAD-7–PSS correlation r = 0.74 (very strong predictor).
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5; Z ≈ +1.65; PSQI–PSS r = 0.43).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z ≈ +1.03; r with PSS = 0.63).
  - Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 high) and lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44; NGSE–PSS r = -0.66).
- Multiple independent subjective domains (anxiety, sleep, affect regulation, pain, coping) point in the same direction, increasing confidence that PSS is above the cohort mean.
- Although some wearable physiology (stable circadian metrics, low resting HR, clear amplitude) suggests resilience, these objective signals have weaker predictive weight here than the strong subjective markers.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.62)
- Extremely elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 14; Z ≈ +3.37), a strong, salient indicator of elevated perceived stress in this sample.
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity consistent with higher PSS:
  - Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.74), low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ -1.29), reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -0.81).
  - Large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD Z ≈ +1.55) and sleep start time (SD Z ≈ +1.19).
  - Low physical activity (exercise-frequency Z ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and modestly higher alcohol use (Z ≈ +1.0) that can co-occur with stress.
- Countervailing evidence reduces the likelihood of very high PSS: depressive and trait-anxiety scores are near/below mean, self-esteem/happiness/social time are at/above mean, resting HR and nocturnal HR drops are not indicative of high PSS. The summary explicitly infers only a slight elevation above the population mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s elevation is supported by multiple subjective domains that (a) each deviate above mean and (b) have relatively large correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74, BASIS-24 r = 0.63, NGSE r = -0.66). The convergence across anxiety, sleep complaints, affect lability, pain, and reduced coping suggests a robust signal of above-mean perceived stress in that cohort.
- Participant 2’s strongest signal is a very large PSQI Z (+3.37). However, the PSQI–PSS association in the description appears weaker than the GAD–PSS link in Participant 1’s cohort. Moreover, Participant 2 shows many neutral-to-protective indicators (CES-D, STAI-T, RSES, happiness, social time, long median sleep) that mitigate the single extreme sleep complaint. The summary itself judges Participant 2’s PSS only slightly above their cohort mean.
- In weighing relative magnitudes, Participant 2 has one extreme outlier in sleep quality but lacks the broader constellation of high-anxiety/high-affect markers that Participant 1 has. Participant 1 combines multiple moderately-to-strongly elevated predictors with strong correlations to PSS, making a larger net elevation in perceived stress more likely despite some protective physiology.

- Low coping resources: markedly low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -2.29), which negatively correlates with PSS and tends to amplify perceived stress.
- Objective wearable data consistent with stress-related dysregulation: extremely short median sleep (3 h 42 min) with large night-to-night variability, circadian fragmentation (low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability), and dampened HR rhythm—these converge with self-report to indicate disrupted recovery and daily structure.
- Physiological markers temporally linked to stress: elevated late‑evening/early‑night heart‑rate deviations that correlate moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), compatible with nocturnal arousal/insomnia.
- Balance of evidence in the description explicitly concludes the participant is above their study population mean (population mean = 20.33); several high‑Z risk indicators (>2 SD) are present.
- (Minor) Some protective features exist (low substance use, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), but the description states these are outweighed by multiple, strong risk signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their description)
- Some psychosocial signals that trend toward higher stress: STAI‑Trait ~41 (near sample mean), CES‑D = 14 (nonzero symptoms), lower health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2), lower self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ -0.59). These measures have modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Small sleep timing and duration variability (z ≈ 0.35 and 0.17) and behavioral patterns (high video‑game time, solitary screen time) that could reflect coping/avoidance associated with stress.
- The description notes these factors provide modest evidence for stress vulnerability relative to the study mean (population mean = 21.61).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (evidence in their description)
- Strong, objective protective physiology and behavior: very high interdaily stability (0.66, z ≈ 2.07), high 24‑hr autocorrelation (z ≈ 1.74), above‑average amplitude (z ≈ 1.01) — indicators of robust circadian regularity that correlate negatively with PSS.
- Low resting heart rate (50 bpm, z ≈ -0.97) and pronounced nocturnal HR reductions (strong parasympathetic pattern), consistent with lower tonic physiological arousal.
- Adequate objective and subjective sleep: median ~7 h 18 min (z ≈ 0.14) and PSQI = 5 (z ≈ -0.8, classified as good sleep).
- Overall integration in the description explicitly infers PSS at or slightly below the population mean (21.61), with physiological signals outweighing modest psychosocial risk signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame and overall weighing
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is described as above their sample mean (20.33); Participant 2 is described as near to slightly below their sample mean (21.61).
- Magnitude and number of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple, large‑magnitude risk indicators across domains (severe clinical anxiety, very poor sleep both subjective and objective, high pain/interference, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy)—several Zs ≳ 2—suggesting a substantial positive deviation from their population mean PSS.
- Participant 2 presents a mixed profile: psychosocial indicators lean modestly toward higher stress, but several relatively strong objective protective markers (circadian robustness, good sleep quantity/quality, low resting HR) are present and the overall inference is that PSS is at or slightly below their population mean. The self‑report risk signals for Participant 2 are less extreme in magnitude than Participant 1’s.
- Even accounting for the fact that Participant 2’s population mean (21.61) is higher than Participant 1’s (20.33), the balance and severity of evidence indicate Participant 1 is more likely to have the worse overall perceived stress: Participant 1 shows concentrated, high‑magnitude indicators across psychological, somatic, and wearable domains, whereas Participant 2’s wearables and sleep argue for lower or near‑average perceived stress despite some psychosocial cautionary signs.

- High reported time spent playing video games (z ≈ 2.47) and elevated solitary screen time that could reflect coping/avoidance patterns associated with distress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Strong subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 16 (z = 0.83) and very short wearable median sleep (1 h 44 min, z ≈ -1.24). PSQI has a strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.58), making this a substantive upward driver.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 average 7.78, z ≈ 0.71; PAPAS 78, z ≈ 0.8), both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations suggesting night arousal (midnight–early morning positive deviations), which align with sleep disruption and correlate positively with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.42 for some hours).
- Variable sleep start times (start-time SD ≈ 160 minutes), supporting the presence of significant sleep disruption/irregularity tied to higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is described relative to its own cohort mean. Participant 1 is inferred to be at or slightly below their cohort mean PSS (study mean 21.61) because the strongest signals (circadian regularity, low resting HR, adequate sleep duration, good subjective sleep) are protective; the psychosocial risk signals are modest and weaker correlates of PSS.
- Participant 2 is inferred to be near but modestly above their cohort mean PSS (study mean 21.5). Critically, Participant 2’s largest elevated measures (PSQI and pain/interference) are among the strongest predictors of PSS in that sample (higher correlations and substantive z‑scores), outweighing some strong protective features.
- In terms of predictor strength and magnitude: Participant 2’s elevated PSQI and pain measures are stronger and more direct correlates of higher PSS than Participant 1’s psychosocial signals (which are smaller in magnitude and weaker predictors). Participant 1’s physiological and sleep markers point toward lower perceived stress, whereas Participant 2’s objective and subjective sleep disruption and pain provide a more substantial upward push on PSS despite some protective traits.

Overall determination
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their cohort), because their key elevated predictors (poor subjective sleep and pain/interference) are both larger in magnitude and more strongly correlated with PSS than Participant 1’s relatively modest psychosocial risk signals.

- Short objective sleep duration (median ~6 h 2 min; Z ≈ −1.43 relative to cohort) and late sleep onset (~1:43 AM), both behaviors commonly linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Reduced interdaily stability of heart‑rate rhythm (value 0.33, Z ≈ −0.66), which can reflect inconsistent day‑to‑day scheduling and has modest positive association with PSS.
- Lower momentary happiness (current = 3.0, Z ≈ −0.53), which shows a modest inverse relation to stress in the sample.
Note: these stress‑related signals are generally smaller in magnitude and several wearable–PSS correlations are weak; they were judged in the original summary to be outweighed by stronger protective indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, Z ≈ 1.51) — a very strong predictor of higher PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.75).
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16, Z ≈ 0.83) and short objective sleep (~4 h 55 min) with late sleep timing — both supporting higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS, Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which positively correlate with PSS and increase daily strain.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73), a robust predictor of higher PSS (negative correlation ~ −0.61).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal (large positive HR deviations at night, some Zs >2 and positive correlations with PSS), consistent with hyperarousal linking anxiety and poor sleep to higher stress.
- Although some circadian regularity metrics (amplitude, interdaily stability) and low intradaily fragmentation are relatively protective, they are described as partial mitigators and do not offset the strong symptom signals.

Comparative weighing of evidence (taking within-population frames into account)
- Participant 1’s strongest signals pointing toward lower stress are multiple and consistent (low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR, low intradaily variability). The stress‑related signals for P1 are primarily sleep/circadian and relatively modest in effect size.
- Participant 2 shows several large, directly stress‑relevant signals (severe clinical anxiety with very high correlation to PSS, severe subjective sleep disturbance, high pain/interference, low self‑efficacy, and marked nocturnal physiological arousal). These features have larger Z‑scores/effect sizes and stronger known associations with PSS in that study.
- Both summaries explicitly infer P1 is likely below their population mean and P2 is likely above their population mean. Given the magnitude and number of high‑impact stress indicators for Participant 2 versus the primarily protective profile for Participant 1 (despite some sleep problems), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 has the worse overall perceived stress.

The main counter-indicator (PSQI = 7) is solitary and its correlation with PSS is more modest than the large protective signals.

- Large, clinically meaningful elevations on mood/anxiety inventories: CES‑D = 33 (Z ≈ +2.05, clinically depressed) and STAI–Trait = 58 (Z ≈ +1.65, clinically anxious). Both scales are positively correlated with PSS in the sample and are the strongest signals here.
- Low self-regard and low positive affect: Rosenberg self‑esteem and happiness both substantially below the sample mean (Z ≈ -1.7 and -1.6), which are negatively correlated with PSS and therefore support higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05) despite preserved objective duration — subjective poor sleep often accompanies and elevates perceived stress.
- Physiological markers of within‑day arousal/irregularity: elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.02) and pronounced evening HR elevation (Z up to ≈ +2.24) that align with higher stress/arousal.
- Integrated interpretation in the description explicitly concludes P1’s PSS is above the study mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83) and concordant wearable signal of extremely short median sleep (1 h 44 m; Z ≈ -1.24) — PSQI is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS; Z ≈ +0.7–0.8) and these measures correlate moderately‑strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), so pain could meaningfully raise perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations suggesting nocturnal arousal (modest positive deviations correlated with PSS).

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Strength and number of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple, strong psychological risk markers (clinically elevated depressive and trait anxiety scores, low self‑esteem and happiness) that are established and moderately correlated with PSS. Participant 2’s primary risk signals are concentrated in sleep disturbance and pain, while many other domains are protective.
- Magnitude of elevations: P1’s CES‑D and STAI Z‑scores (≈ +2.05 and +1.65) are larger and more clinically significant than P2’s elevated PSQI and pain Zs (≈ +0.8). P2’s most protective variables (GAD‑7 Z ≈ -1.2, NGSE slight positive, strong circadian/cardiac markers) are substantial and counterbalance their risk signals.
- Measurement caveats: P2’s wearable median sleep (very short) could reflect non‑wear/artifact, though it aligns with PSQI; nevertheless, even accepting the sleep problem, P2 retains several robust resilience indicators (low generalized anxiety, high self‑efficacy, regular circadian markers) that argue against a large PSS elevation.
- Overall inference from each summary: P1’s integrated interpretation explicitly concludes above‑mean PSS; P2’s integrated interpretation concludes near the mean with only a modest uplift possible from sleep/pain.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 presents a broader and stronger set of indicators that predict elevated perceived stress (multiple clinical self‑report elevations plus physiological arousal), whereas Participant 2 presents a narrower cluster of risk (sleep + pain) that is substantially offset by strong protective signals (low anxiety, high self‑efficacy, robust circadian/HR markers).
- Therefore, Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their respective study population.

21,92412,30,16,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their summary)
- Direct summary judgment: the synthesis explicitly concludes the participant is consistent with perceived stress above their study mean (population mean PSS = 20.67).
- Strong, high-correlation predictors elevated:
  - Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12) with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.77).
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5, z ≈ 1.32) with moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Convergent physiological evidence of nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight hourly HR deviations substantially above the sample mean (e.g., +11.9 bpm at midnight, z ≈ 1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39).
- Lower-than-average self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ -0.66), consistent with elevated perceived stress.
- Additional stress-relevant behavior: elevated substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ +1.5), which, while not strongly correlated with PSS here, can be stress-relevant.
- Although there are some protective signals (adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR, preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation), the highest-weighted signals (anxiety, PSQI, nocturnal HR) are strongly associated with higher PSS in this sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their summary)
- The synthesis explicitly concludes the participant is most consistent with perceived stress below their study mean (population mean PSS = 21.63), so there is no strong overall indication they are above-mean.
- Small signals that could point toward higher stress (but are weak):
  - Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.81) which has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.17).
  - Some reduction in 24-hour autocorrelation and only moderate interdaily stability (small deviations), suggesting mild day-to-day routine variability.
  - Large evening HR deviations (very large z at 5–6 PM), though these are plausibly explained by frequent late-afternoon exercise rather than stress; some small nighttime-to-morning HR deviations have weak positive correlations with PSS.
- Overall these circadian/wearable signals that could suggest stress are small in magnitude and/or plausibly attributable to healthy behavior (exercise), and the strongest predictors (low CES-D, low STAI, good PSQI, high happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR) point toward below-mean PSS.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its own study mean. Participant 1 is characterized as above their population mean (20.67) largely on the basis of high-GAD-7 and very poor PSQI, both of which have relatively large correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean (21.63) with multiple strong protective indicators (CES-D, STAI, PSQI, sleep regularity, low resting HR).
- The magnitude and correlation strength of Participant 1’s elevating signals (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77 and PSQI r ≈ 0.45, and nocturnal HR elevations with moderate correlations) are larger and more directly tied to PSS than the relatively small, equivocal stress-related signals in Participant 2 (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.17, evening HR likely exercise-related).
- Thus, within their respective-study frames, Participant 1 shows stronger and more direct evidence of above-mean perceived stress, while Participant 2 shows clear evidence of below-mean perceived stress with only weak countervailing signals.

Decision (which participant likely has higher PSS)
- Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

9,19245,12,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated affective symptomatology: CES-D = 26 (z = +1.32) and trait anxiety STAI = 55 (z = +1.35). Both are >1 SD above the study mean and the summary notes moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), so these are substantive predictors of higher perceived stress.
- Low positive affect / social trust: happiness z = -1.61 and trust z = -2.07, consistent with reduced well-being and social resources that typically covary with higher PSS.
- Sleep timing and regularity problems: clinically meaningful PSQI (>5), very late median sleep onset (02:38) and large night-to-night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.23; start SD z ≈ +0.92). Irregular circadian metrics (low interdaily stability z = -0.82, flattened amplitude) are described as linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Nocturnal/late-evening physiological activation: elevated HR deviations in late evening/early night (z’s up to +2.25) consistent with nocturnal arousal and difficulty winding down.
- Overall summary from the profile explicitly concludes PSS likely above the sample mean (sample mean 21.6, SD = 3.67).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (disturbed sleep) and extremely short median nightly sleep (3 h 27 min), plus high intradaily variability (z = 2.29). PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.46), making sleep disturbance a relevant contributor to higher PSS.
- Increased daytime napping and fragmented rest–activity rhythms, which in the summary are associated with higher PSS tendencies.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale elevated z ≈ 0.94), which could add psychosocial stress (though its correlation with PSS in this sample is small).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (important comparative points)
- Low anxiety (GAD-7 = 4, z = -0.94) and high self-efficacy (NGSE z = +0.49). Critically, in this study GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.76) and NGSE strongly inversely (r = -0.65). Those strong associations are powerful indicators pointing to lower perceived stress for this participant.
- Very low emotional lability (z = -1.67) and low pain scores (PEG-3 z = -1.28), which are consistent with lower PSS.
- Physiological pattern consistent with preserved diurnal amplitude and daytime HR elevations that, in the sample, associate with lower PSS.
- The profile summary explicitly concludes the participant likely falls below the sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.42, SD = 7.28), largely because the strongest correlated predictors (GAD-7, NGSE) favor lower stress despite poor sleep.

Comparative reasoning within each sample frame
- Participant 1’s high affective scores (>1 SD above the mean) are moderate predictors of PSS in that sample and the sample SD for PSS is relatively small (SD = 3.67), so elevated depressive/anxiety scores and corroborating late-night physiological activation point convincingly toward PSS above that sample mean.
- Participant 2’s worst indicators are sleep-related, which do correlate with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.46), but the single strongest sample-level predictors (GAD-7 and NGSE) have larger absolute correlations with PSS and here point strongly toward lower perceived stress. Also, Participant 2’s population PSS SD is relatively large (SD = 7.28), meaning individual predictors must be strong to shift the expected PSS substantially above the mean — and the strongest predictors here favor below-mean PSS.
- In short: Participant 1 shows multiple, moderately-weighted stress-linked signals (affective symptoms, circadian disruption, nocturnal HR arousal) that collectively point above their sample mean. Participant 2 shows severe sleep risk but has very strong, opposing indicator(s) (low GAD-7, high NGSE) that in this sample are more predictive of lower PSS.

Weighting the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: net evidence favors above-mean PSS (affective symptoms + circadian/sleep irregularity + nocturnal HR arousal outweigh protective factors).
- Participant 2: mixed profile but the strongest, highest-correlation predictors indicate below-mean PSS despite severe sleep restriction; the profile summary likewise leans below the mean.

4,99733,31,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence in favor of above-mean stress for P1)
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.09), indicating day-to-day fragmentation that correlates positively with PSS.
- Reduced 24-h autocorrelation and lower circadian amplitude (autocorr Z ≈ −0.53; amplitude Z ≈ −0.43), suggestive of blunted circadian organization associated with higher stress.
- Modestly elevated resting HR (Z ≈ +0.53) and atypical nocturnal-to-morning HR deviations (early-morning hourly correlations r ≈ 0.19–0.22), pointing to physiological arousal patterns linked to higher PSS.
- Irregular sleep timing and duration (sleep start SD ≈ 65 min, duration SD ≈ 86 min) with small positive correlations to PSS.
- Integrated interpretation in the description: physiology tilts toward modestly higher perceived stress even though self-report is low; inference placed near the sample mean with a plausible slight upward deviation.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in favor of above-mean stress for P2)
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ +1.51) and a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.75)—one of the most powerful predictors reported.
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83) and short median sleep (~4 h 55 min); PSQI also strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- High pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS Z ≈ +1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ −0.61).
- Pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations (late-night hourly deviations with very large Zs, e.g., 12–1 AM Z ≈ 2.83) and late sleep onset—physiological night-time hyperarousal supporting the symptom profile.
- Integrated interpretation in the description: multiple large-effect self-report measures and nocturnal physiology coherently point to PSS above the study mean; circadian regularity metrics are noted as partial mitigators but weaker than the dominant stress signals.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is anchored to its own sample mean (P1 mean = 21.62; P2 mean = 20.62). The descriptions already interpret each participant relative to their respective cohort: P1 ≈ near mean (with modest physiological tilt up), P2 = above mean (driven by multiple large symptom signals).
- Strength and number of indicators: P2 shows multiple strong, high-Z self-report indicators (severe anxiety, very poor PSQI, high pain interference, low self-efficacy) with large correlations to PSS—especially anxiety (r ≈ 0.75). P1’s strongest stress signals are physiological and of more modest effect sizes (one notable Z for intradaily variability ≈ +1.09 and smaller Zs/correlations elsewhere), while self-report symptom measures point toward lower stress.
- Directional concordance: P2’s subjective symptoms and nocturnal physiology are concordant (both indicating elevated stress). P1 shows a discordance (low reported symptoms but some physiological stress markers), which reduces confidence that P1’s overall perceived stress is substantially above their cohort mean.
- Overall evidentiary weight: the magnitude, coherence, and number of high-effect signals in Participant 2 (especially severe anxiety and very poor sleep) outweigh the modest, primarily physiological signals in Participant 1.

22,49086,10,23,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83). PSQI is moderately–strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantial upward predictor of PSS.
- Wearable sleep signature consistent with severe disruption: median recorded sleep ~1 h 44 min (Z ≈ -1.24) and high variability in sleep start time. Even allowing for non-wear bias, this objective signal aligns with the high PSQI and supports elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and functional interference: PEG-3 avg = 7.78 (Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS composite Z ≈ +0.8. Both correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), so these likely raise inferred PSS.
- Nocturnal HR deviations suggest some night arousal: positive deviations around midnight–early morning with modest correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.42) — consistent with sleep/pain-related stress.

Reasons mitigating a higher PSS for Participant 1
- Low anxiety and emotional lability: GAD-7 low (Z ≈ -1.2) and BASIS-24 emotional lability low (Z ≈ -1.17). GAD-7 is strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.75), so these are strong protective indicators against high PSS.
- High self-efficacy and good interpersonal functioning: NGSE slightly above mean (Z ≈ +0.12) with strong inverse correlation to PSS (r ≈ -0.68); interpersonal functioning Z ≈ -0.87. These weigh toward lower PSS.
- Robust circadian/cardiac markers of resilience: low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -1.35), higher HR amplitude (Z ≈ +1.38), lower resting HR (Z ≈ -1.02), and consistent day-to-day timing — all weakly inversely correlated with PSS and protective.

Net interpretation within Participant 1’s frame: several moderate-to-strong predictors push PSS upward (especially subjective sleep disturbance and pain), but several robust protective traits (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy, good circadian/cardiac patterns) offset those risks. The provided summary characterizes this participant as near the sample mean with a modest upward contribution from sleep and pain — i.e., plausibly slightly above the population mean but not markedly so.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Late sleep timing and some subjective disturbance: median sleep start ≈ 02:19, PSQI = 6 (above common cutoff), though PSQI elevation is small (not extreme).
- Nocturnal physiological activation: pronounced HR deviation around midnight–1am (mean dev ≈ +9.8 bpm, Z ≈ +1.66) and elevated HR at 1–2am (Z ≈ +1.18). These nocturnal elevations can be associated with higher perceived stress.
- Some weakening of circadian amplitude/stability: amplitude Z ≈ -0.57 and interdaily stability slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.16); lower amplitude has a small negative correlation with PSS in the dataset (≈ -0.16).
- Slightly lower health satisfaction and happiness (Z ≈ -0.7 and Z ≈ -0.53), modestly concordant with elevated perceived stress.

Reasons mitigating a higher PSS for Participant 2
- Very low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety: CES-D Z ≈ -1.28 and STAI Z ≈ -1.02. These have direct positive correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so low scores are strong indicators of lower PSS.
- High self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ +1.10) and substantial social engagement (Z ≈ +0.95), both modestly protective against PSS.
- Adequate sleep duration overall: median nightly sleep ~7 h 18 min (Z ≈ +0.15) despite late timing; resting HR and 24-h autocorrelation also suggest stable physiology (RHR Z ≈ -0.22; 24-h autocorr Z ≈ +0.39).
- The study summary explicitly concludes participant likely scores below the population mean PSS.

Net interpretation within Participant 2’s frame: late timing and nocturnal HR activation are risk signals but are circumscribed (specific to late-night hours) and relatively small compared with the strong, trait-level indicators of lower distress (very low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, social buffers). The study summary therefore infers PSS below the sample mean.

Comparative weighing and final decision
- Strength and direction of predictors: Participant 1 shows strong predictors both for higher PSS (very high PSQI, objective short/irregular sleep, elevated pain/interference) and also strong predictors for lower PSS (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy). Participant 2’s risk signals are milder (PSQI = 6, late sleep timing, nocturnal HR spikes) while their protective signals (very low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, social engagement) are strong and directly linked to lower PSS.
- Magnitude and relevance: Participant 1’s sleep and pain elevations are sizable and are moderate-to-strong correlates with PSS in that sample — these push estimated PSS upward more substantially than the relatively modest nocturnal/sleep-timing signals in Participant 2 push PSS upward. Conversely, Participant 2’s low depression and anxiety (Zs ~ -1.0 to -1.3) are powerful signals for lower PSS, stronger in relative weight than Participant 1’s protective signals are at pushing PSS downward far below the mean.
- Summary judgment in the within-population frame: Participant 2 is explicitly inferred to be below their population mean. Participant 1 is inferred to be near the population mean with a modest upward contribution from sleep and pain. Therefore, relative to their own study populations, Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.42).
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning 2–6am values with Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).
- The subjective/objective sleep discrepancy (good objective duration but poor subjective quality) can be associated with distress in some individuals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8) and a positive PSQI–PSS relationship in the sample.
- Very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (sleep SD Z ≈ +3.37), indicating irregular sleep patterns strongly linked to stress/dysregulation.
- Blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -0.81) and lower mesor (Z ≈ -1.28), both modestly associated with higher PSS in the dataset.
- Trait anxiety (STAI) shows a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), and lower reported happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) also aligns with higher PSS.
- The combination of subjective sleep problems, extreme sleep irregularity, and blunted rhythm metrics forms a cluster that aligns with elevated perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its own study mean: Participant 1 is interpreted as below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.5), Participant 2 as slightly above their population mean PSS (mean = 21.61).
- The protective signals for Participant 1 are strong and multiple (maximum self-efficacy NGSE Z = +1.79 with strong NGSE–PSS correlation r = -0.60; very low GAD-7 Z = -1.38 with strong GAD–PSS r ≈ +0.75; very low RHR Z = -2.23; high circadian amplitude Z = +1.89). These high-magnitude, highly correlated protective indicators outweigh the isolated sleep/HR risk signals.
- Participant 2 shows several risk indicators of substantial magnitude for elevating perceived stress—most notably extreme night-to-night sleep variability (Z ≈ +3.37) and poor subjective sleep—alongside blunted amplitude and modest anxiety/happiness signals. Although Participant 2 has some protective factors (low mesor/RHR, low intradaily variability, exercise/social engagement), the sleep irregularity and subjective sleep problems are prominent and were flagged in the summary as the main drivers of being above the mean.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple strong, convergent protective signals; only a single notable countervailing factor (PSQI), so interpreted as below their cohort mean.
- Participant 2: a cluster of stress-related signals (particularly extreme sleep inconsistency and subjective poor sleep) that the summary explicitly interprets as modestly above their cohort mean.

- Strong self-report signals of distress: high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; z ≈ +1.95) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 54; z ≈ +1.25), both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Low self-esteem (RSES z ≈ −1.85), low current happiness (z ≈ −1.61) and subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6) that align with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral/physiological signs consistent with stress: late habitual sleep onset (~1:21 AM), pronounced evening heart‑rate elevation (9–11 PM), and slightly above-average alcohol use (z ≈ +1.0).

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or moderated) PSS score
- Objective resilience markers: strong interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ +1.15 each), lower intradaily variability (z ≈ −0.53), modestly lower resting HR (z ≈ −0.17).
- Adequate and consistent sleep duration (median ≈ 7h15m, low night-to-night variability), frequent group exercise (z ≈ +1.23), and low recreational drug use — all factors that can buffer perceived stress.
- The self-report predictors that are elevated (CES-D, STAI) have only modest correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.29 and 0.32), so their translated effect on PSS is attenuated compared with stronger predictors elsewhere.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very strong self-report predictors: severe generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, z ≈ +1.51) and GAD-7’s very high correlation with PSS (r = 0.74) — this is the single strongest available predictor of higher PSS.
- Pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI z ≈ +1.65) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ +1.03); both correlate substantially with PSS (PSQI r = 0.43; emotional lability r = 0.63).
- Additional converging subjective risk factors: elevated pain/functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) and reduced self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.44; NGSE r with PSS = −0.66), each supporting higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or moderated) PSS score
- Objective physiological/circadian markers consistent with resilience: interdaily stability above average (z ≈ +0.65), low intradaily variability (z ≈ −0.59), lower resting HR and mesor (z’s ≈ −0.9 and −1.35), clear circadian amplitude — features typically associated with lower PSS.
- Some hourly heart‑rate deviations (deep night troughs, pronounced daytime elevations) are patterns that in this sample can predict lower PSS for certain hours, introducing complexity into the physiological signal.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are characterized as above their respective study means, but the strength and directness of the subjective predictors differ. Participant 1’s largest z-score on self-report is CES-D (z ≈ +1.95), but CES‑D and STAI have only modest correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.29 and 0.32). Participant 1 also shows several robust objective resilience markers (interdaily stability z ≈ +1.16; frequent group exercise z ≈ +1.23) that plausibly moderate perceived stress.
- Participant 2’s self-report elevations include measures that are both large and tightly linked to PSS in that cohort: GAD‑7 (z ≈ +1.51) with r = 0.74, PSQI (z ≈ +1.65) with r = 0.43, and emotional lability (z ≈ +1.03) with r = 0.63. These convergent, high‑weight predictors point more directly to elevated PSS than Participant 1’s predictors do. Participant 2’s objective physiology is relatively protective, but these protective features have smaller predictive weight relative to the very strong subjective indicators (especially GAD‑7).

Overall judgment
- Although both participants likely report above‑average perceived stress in their respective samples, the balance of evidence — particularly the presence in Participant 2 of highly predictive, convergent subjective indicators (most notably GAD‑7 with very high correlation to PSS, and extreme PSQI) — indicates that Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Very large objective sleep deficit and very late sleep timing (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 30 min; median sleep onset ≈ 03:37 AM). Short and severely shifted sleep is strongly linked with higher PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.48; short sleep is a salient abnormality here).
- Clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5) which correlates moderately-strongly with PSS.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43), and pain measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (late-night HR Z up to ≈ 0.67), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −0.34), and reduced 24-h autocorrelation — physiological signals that in this sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Convergence of multiple moderate-to-strong risk indicators (sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) that the summary explicitly judges as outweighing some protective signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 21; Z ≈ +0.8) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z ≈ +0.86); both are established correlates of higher PSS in this sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Some circadian/behavioral instability: high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.09), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), and modestly short/variable sleep (median ≈ 6 h 46 min; sleep start SD ≈ 99 min) — these features align with higher PSS, though their sample correlations are smaller.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29) which, given its negative correlation with PSS, contributes to risk (though the correlation is modest, r ≈ −0.15).

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame
- Both profiles are judged by their respective summaries as “above the population mean,” but the nature and magnitude of risk indicators differ.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators are concentrated in high-impact, moderately-to-strongly PSS-correlated domains (extreme objective and subjective sleep disturbance, substantial pain, nocturnal physiological arousal). Several of these individual deviations are large (e.g., extreme short sleep, pain Z ≈ +1.33).
- Participant 2 shows consistent risk across affective symptom scales (depression, trait anxiety) and circadian fragmentation, but the associations of these specific measures with PSS in this sample are generally smaller than the strongest PSS correlates reported for Participant 1 (e.g., GAD-7 had r ≈ 0.77 in P1’s writeup; pain/PSQI correlations for P1 were ≈0.48–0.5). Many of Participant 2’s strongest deviations are either of more moderate effect on PSS or counterbalanced by strong protective behaviors (frequent exercise, no substance use, low resting HR).
- Participant 1 has very large, directly stress-relevant physiological/behavioral abnormalities (especially the extreme sleep restriction and elevated pain) that are likely to drive higher perceived stress relative to that study’s mean, even though some strong self-report protective traits (low anxiety, high self-efficacy) are present.
- Participant 2’s risk signals are substantial but more moderate in intensity and are offset by pronounced protective behaviors and physiology (high exercise frequency, low resting HR, no substance use), which reduces the likely magnitude of PSS elevation relative to that study’s mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The convergence of several large, high-impact abnormalities in domains with moderate-to-strong sample-level correlations with PSS (extreme short sleep, disturbed sleep quality, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevation) makes Participant 1 the more likely to exhibit a higher PSS relative to their population mean than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.
- Participant 2 is plausibly above their mean but likely at a more moderate elevation because their strongest risk signals have smaller sample correlations with PSS and are more balanced by strong protective factors.

- Behavioral risk: no exercise (Z ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) which reduces stress resilience.
- Some wearable physiologic signs (slightly elevated resting HR, modestly blunted amplitude) that align with stress-related dysregulation.
- The description explicitly concludes the participant is moderately above their sample mean PSS (study mean = 21.61).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, “Disturbed Sleep”), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42).
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning values with Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).
- These are the principal stress-elevating signals in the profile, but they are relatively isolated and have smaller or moderate effect sizes compared with the participant’s protective indicators.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is reported relative to its own cohort mean; the cohort means are nearly identical (Participant 1: 21.61; Participant 2: 21.5), so relative placements are directly comparable.
- Participant 1’s above-mean inference is driven by multiple psychological symptom scores (depression, trait anxiety) and objectively short sleep — several signals that are directly linked to PSS, even if their sample correlations are moderate.
- Participant 2’s below-mean inference is driven by very strong protective signals: maximal self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.79) with a large negative NGSE–PSS correlation (r = -0.60), very low GAD-7 (Z = -1.38) with a very strong GAD–PSS correlation (r = 0.75), very low interpersonal problems (Z = -2.47), strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and amplitude Zs ≈ +1.8 to +1.9), and very low resting HR (Z = -2.23). Many of these protective variables have larger correlations with PSS than the risk variables present in Participant 1.
- Although Participant 2 has subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 7), this appears to be an isolated countervailing factor against a largely robust set of low-stress indicators.
- The magnitude and number of stress-promoting indicators in Participant 1 (multiple elevated symptom measures plus short sleep and low activity) outweigh the isolated sleep/HR issues in Participant 2. Conversely, Participant 2’s strong protective signals (several with large effect sizes) argue for substantially lower PSS relative to their cohort.

Overall balance and determination
- Participant 1: multiple moderate-to-strong risk signals and explicit conclusion of being moderately above their cohort mean.
- Participant 2: multiple strong protective signals (some with large correlations to PSS) and explicit conclusion of being below their cohort mean; the few risk signals are smaller in magnitude or isolated.

24,14737,33,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Trait anxiety elevated (STAI–Trait = 45; z ≈ +0.37). STAI–Trait correlates with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31), so this supports higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and short median nightly sleep (6 h 3 min; sleep duration z ≈ −1.41) — poor/short sleep is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- High night-to-night variability in sleep duration and start time (sleep duration SD z ≈ +0.74; start-time SD z ≈ +1.14). Sleep-timing irregularity correlates positively with PSS (corr ≈ 0.14–0.17).
- Elevated intradaily variability (heart-rate rhythm fragmentation; IV = 0.64; z ≈ +0.67), which correlates positively with PSS (corr ≈ +0.16).
- Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg z ≈ −0.59), which is modestly associated with higher PSS (corr ≈ −0.15).
- Integrated interpretation in the description: these moderate signals outweigh protective signs and lead to an inference of PSS modestly above the study mean (21.62).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; z = 1.51). GAD-7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74), making this a powerful predictor of elevated PSS.
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5; z = 1.65). PSQI correlates with PSS (r = 0.43), supporting higher perceived stress.
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 1.03), which strongly correlates with PSS (r = 0.63).
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS elevated), which are positively associated with PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.44), and NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.66), indicating reduced coping resources and higher PSS.
- Integrated interpretation in the description: the convergent, large-effect-size self-report measures lead to the conclusion that this participant’s PSS is above the study mean (20.54), despite some protective wearable measures.

Comparative reasoning (explicitly within each study’s frame)
- Strength and weight of predictors: Participant 2’s profile contains multiple large z-score elevations on self-report measures that have strong correlations with PSS in their cohort (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74 and BASIS-24 r = 0.63). Those are high-effect signals that the description explicitly treats as the dominant evidence for elevated PSS.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators are more moderate in magnitude (STAI z ≈ +0.37, PSQI mild, sleep variability and IV moderate) and correlations with PSS in that dataset are smaller (corrs generally ~0.14–0.31). Several protective physiological and affective markers (low RHR, preserved circadian amplitude, above-average happiness, low substance use) are reported and partially offset the stress signals.
- Both participants are inferred above their cohort means, but the case for Participant 2 is stronger because (a) multiple self-report predictors are substantially above the cohort mean and (b) those predictors have larger correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 1’s elevation is characterized as modest and based on more moderate signals.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows stronger, higher-effect-size subjective indicators that are tightly linked to PSS in that study (especially severe GAD-7 and very high PSQI), pointing to a larger deviation above their cohort mean than Participant 1’s more modest, mixed-profile deviation above theirs.

9,70492,12,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; PSQI correlates moderately with PSS, r = 0.46), which in the sample is linked to higher perceived stress.
- Very short objective sleep (median nightly sleep = 3 h 27 min) and high night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD Z = 0.62), both of which can contribute to greater stress.
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity (Z = 2.29; r with PSS = 0.24), indicating fragmented circadian organization associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 0.94), which could act as a psychosocial stressor (though its sample correlation with PSS is small and not clearly supportive).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI z = 0.76) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D z = 0.28); both correlate positively with PSS in that sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28).
- Markedly late and highly irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:03; sleep duration SD Z = 2.75; sleep start SD Z = 1.21), and reduced circadian amplitude (Amplitude Z = -0.44), which in the dataset associate with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral risk factors (low exercise, high sedentary hobby time Z = 1.41, more frequent beer consumption Z ≈ 1.01) that weaken resilience and are weakly linked to higher PSS.
- Circadian and heart-rate patterns consistent with blunted/shifted rhythms that have been tied to greater stress in the sample.

Comparative reasoning (accounting for within-population frames)
- Participant 1: evidence is mixed but the strongest, most highly correlated predictors in that sample point toward lower perceived stress (very low GAD‑7, r = 0.76 with PSS; high self‑efficacy NGSE, r = -0.65; very low emotional lability). Sleep-related signals are strong risk factors here (very short objective sleep, PSQI = 10), but their sample-level correlations with PSS are weaker than the protective indicators.
- Participant 2: multiple independent indicators (elevated trait anxiety, some depressive symptoms, extreme sleep timing irregularity, reduced circadian amplitude, and adverse behaviors) consistently point toward PSS modestly above that population mean. Although correlations for each measure are smaller than the strongest predictors in Participant 1’s dataset, they accumulate across psychological, behavioral, and circadian domains and the study summary explicitly infers slightly above-mean PSS.
- Because each description is relative to its own study mean, we judge who is more stressed relative to their peers: Participant 1 is inferred below their population mean (protective strong predictors outweigh sleep risks), while Participant 2 is inferred modestly above their population mean with several converging risk signals.

22,27407,10,23,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16, Z = 0.83). PSQI is a moderate-to-strong predictor of PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.58), so this pushes inferred PSS upward.
- Wearable sleep metrics appear disrupted (median recorded sleep 1 h 44 m, high sleep start-time variability). Even if partly artifact, the objective pattern aligns with the high PSQI and supports sleep-related stress.
- Pain and activity interference are elevated (PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 0.7–0.8), and these measures correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), contributing upward pressure on perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations indicate possible night-time arousal that maps onto sleep problems and thus could elevate perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 50, Z = 0.86). Trait anxiety positively correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31) and is a substantive dispositional risk factor.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52) and objectively shortened, late sleep (median ≈ 6 h 14 m, Z = -1.17; sleep start ≈ 02:02). Subjective sleep disruption here is a strong predictor of higher PSS in this sample.
- Relatively high variability/irregularity in sleep timing and lower engagement in some social/leisure buffering activities, which can reduce stress resilience.
- Small negative on self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ -0.31) that modestly undermines buffering capacity.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighting of evidence
- Both profiles are described as mixed and both are ultimately interpreted as modestly above or near their study means. Crucially, each description is calibrated to its own cohort.
- Participant 1’s principal risk signals are sleep disturbance and pain (both meaningful predictors), but they are counterbalanced by several strong protective indicators: very low recent anxiety (GAD-7 Z = -1.2), low emotional lability, higher self-efficacy (NGSE), good interpersonal functioning, robust circadian metrics, and low resting HR. The low GAD-7 is especially important because GAD–PSS correlation in that sample is large (r ≈ 0.75), making the protective effect weighty.
- Participant 2’s strongest risk signals are elevated trait anxiety and a relatively high PSQI (Z = 1.52) plus objectively shortened/late sleep—two robust contributors to higher PSS in that sample. Their protections (low RHR, preserved circadian stability, high academic functioning, above-average happiness) moderate but do not fully counter the anxiety + sleep signals. The summary explicitly concludes Participant 2 is “modestly above the study population mean.”
- Overall, Participant 2 presents multiple convergent moderate risk signals (trait anxiety + subjective sleep disturbance/timing) that are described as the primary drivers of an above-mean PSS. Participant 1, while having notable sleep and pain concerns, has stronger and highly correlated protective factors (notably very low recent anxiety) that leave them nearer to their cohort mean.

4,23287,31,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18) — very large predictor of higher PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.75).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16) and objective nocturnal physiological arousal (large positive hourly HR deviations overnight, late sleep onset, short sleep duration) — both linked to higher PSS.  
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS; Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) — positive, moderately sized associations with PSS.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73) — strong negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), implying reduced coping confidence.  
- Convergent symptom/physiology pattern (anxiety + poor sleep + nocturnal HR elevation + pain + low self-efficacy) produces a coherent high-stress signal that the summary explicitly places above the cohort mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Slightly elevated intradaily variability and sleep start variability, increased nap frequency, and some evening heart-rate elevations — each modestly positively correlated with PSS in the cohort.  
- Low amounts of socializing with friends (z ≈ -1.41) and higher daily internet use (z ≈ 1.52) — small correlations with higher PSS in the sample.  
- These are relatively weak signals in magnitude and correlation compared with the strong protective markers described for this participant.

Comparative reasoning within the two-study frame
- Each description is relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as above their population mean (mean PSS 20.62) with several large, high-correlation indicators of stress (especially severe anxiety and disturbed sleep). Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean (mean PSS 21.62) and shows multiple robust protective signals (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, very low resting HR suggesting fitness, excellent subjective and long objective sleep, regular circadian metrics, high health satisfaction).  
- Although the two populations’ mean PSS values differ by ~1 point (21.62 vs 20.62), the critical comparison is the strength and direction of individual-level predictors relative to each cohort. Participant 1’s symptom profile includes very large, direct predictors of high perceived stress (notably severe anxiety with a strong correlation to PSS), while Participant 2’s profile contains multiple strong protective markers and only weak-to-moderate risk signals.  
- Therefore, on balance of evidence (magnitude of symptom signals, correlations to PSS, and coherence between self-report and physiology), Participant 1 is much more likely to have the higher perceived stress.

10,45641,10,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (""Disturbed Sleep""); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) in this dataset, so reported poor sleep could raise perceived stress.
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations: early-morning HR values show larger negative deviations from mesor that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), providing a modest physiological signal linked to higher PSS.
- Discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep (adequate actigraphic duration but poor PSQI) can be associated with distress and higher perceived stress in some people.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated affective symptoms: CES-D = 22 (z = +0.9) and STAI–Trait = 46 (z = +0.46); both are positively correlated with PSS and are common contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 7, matching a pattern that covaries with higher PSS.
- Low psychosocial resources and negative self-evaluation: low self-esteem (RSES z = -0.87) and low health satisfaction (z = -1.45), both associated with greater perceived stress.
- Behavior patterns that reduce coping resources: very little exercise, minimal socializing, and high sedentary hobby time (sedentary hobby z = +2.01) — these behavioral risk factors are linked to higher stress.
- Physiological signs of elevated arousal: moderately elevated resting heart rate (RHR z = +0.6), higher mesor (z = +0.83), and evening/late-night HR elevations—consistent with increased tonic or evening arousal that often tracks with higher perceived stress.
- Evening-typed schedule and late sleep timing (median ~02:00) with evening arousal may worsen subjective sleep quality and daytime emotion regulation, contributing to higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each summary is already explicitly framed relative to its own study mean (P1 mean 21.5, P2 mean 21.61). Participant 1 is described as likely below that mean; Participant 2 is described as likely above that mean.
- Strength and direction of signals for Participant 1: strong protective signals (maximal NGSE with large negative correlation to PSS, very low GAD-7 with strong positive GAD–PSS correlation, very low resting HR z = -2.23, high circadian stability and amplitude). The only notable risk for P1 is subjective sleep disturbance and modest nocturnal HR–PSS associations. Overall the strongest indicators point clearly toward lower-than-average perceived stress in P1’s sample.
- Strength and direction of signals for Participant 2: a constellation of moderate-to-strong risk signals across affective (depressive and anxiety symptoms), subjective sleep, self-evaluation, behavior (low exercise/socializing, high sedentary time), and modest physiological arousal. Although circadian stability and total sleep time are relatively good (protective), the multiplicity of affective, behavioral, and physiological risk markers provides convergent evidence of higher perceived stress relative to that sample.
- Both participants report PSQI = 7, but for Participant 1 the objective sleep and robust resilience markers mitigate that complaint; for Participant 2, the PSQI aligns with other affective/behavioral risk signals and evening physiological arousal, strengthening the case for higher PSS.
- Given that Participant 1’s strongest signals are protective and of large magnitude (e.g., extreme NGSE, very low RHR), while Participant 2 shows multiple moderate-risk indicators across domains that are known to raise PSS, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 exhibits higher perceived stress relative to their respective sample means.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (Z ≈ +1.52), a strong subjective signal linked to higher PSS.
- Objective sleep/circadian signs of strain: short median sleep (6 h 1 min, Z ≈ −1.45), very late median sleep start (~03:56 AM) with high night‑to‑night variability, reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −0.63), modest intradaily fragmentation, and late‑night HR elevation — all features that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.
- Low physical activity: reports no regular exercise (large negative Z), a behavior that often co‑occurs with higher stress.
- Convergence of multiple risk indicators (affective + subjective sleep + objective circadian/HR) pointing above the population mean, albeit of modest magnitude.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to study mean 20.75)
- Strong self‑report predictors that have large correlations with PSS in this study: GAD‑7 = 7.5 (mild anxiety; GAD r = 0.80) and Emotional Lability = 6.33 (r = 0.67). These measures are among the most predictive of PSS in this dataset.
- Substantive subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (PSQI r = 0.59), a strong survey correlate of higher PSS.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG‑3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55, both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50), adding to self‑reported burden.
- Nocturnal HR deviations at hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45; 2–3am r = 0.40), consistent with stress‑related autonomic signs.
- Although wearable physiology shows protective features (high amplitude, strong 24‑h autocorrelation, long objective sleep), the self‑report measures that are highly predictive of PSS provide a coherent set of signals indicating above‑mean perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are inferred by their respective descriptions to be above their study’s PSS mean. Participant 1’s elevated indicators are numerous and convergent (depression-level CES‑D, poor PSQI, late/short sleep, reduced amplitude, nocturnal HR elevations, no exercise), but the correlation strengths of those predictors with PSS in that sample are modest (e.g., CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32). The narrative explicitly characterizes P1 as “likely above the population mean — likely modestly elevated rather than extreme.”
- Participant 2’s self‑report signals that point toward higher PSS (anxiety, emotional lability, PSQI, pain) have comparatively larger predictive weights in that study (GAD‑7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67; PSQI r = 0.59). Although objective physiology for P2 is relatively protective (high amplitude, consistent rhythms, long objective sleep), the description emphasizes that the high‑weight survey measures still support an above‑mean PSS. The stronger correlations mean that a given elevation on those scales is more informative for higher PSS in Participant 2’s study sample than comparable elevations are in Participant 1’s sample.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Participant 1: multiple risk signals but with modest PSS correlations and an explicit conclusion of only modest elevation above mean.
- Participant 2: several self‑report measures that are highly predictive of PSS in that study (notably GAD‑7 and Emotional Lability) and are elevated; despite protective wearable markers, these high‑weight survey signals point to a meaningful elevation above that study’s mean.

- High variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start-time SD z ≈ +1.55; duration SD z ≈ +0.77), and reduced interdaily stability/24-hour autocorrelation (z ≈ −0.99 and −1.37) and elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.46). These circadian/sleep irregularities are associated with higher PSS in this sample (though correlations are modest, ~+0.14–0.17).
- Frequent alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor three times a week or more; z ≈ +1.7), which could reflect coping and is a behavioral risk factor even if correlation with PSS is small.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (from their description)
- Markedly elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16, z = 0.83) and a strong PSQI–PSS correlation in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), making sleep problems a substantive upward driver of inferred PSS.
- Wearable-derived indications of very short median sleep (1 hr 44 min, z ≈ −1.24) and variable sleep start times, aligning with the high PSQI and implying severe nocturnal disruption (even accounting for possible non-wear).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is framed relative to its own cohort mean. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as below the population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61) based on multiple robust protective indicators (low CES‑D, modest STAI‑Trait, high happiness/self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR). Their sleep/circadian risk signals exist but are modest predictors of PSS in this sample (correlations ~0.14–0.17).
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the cohort mean (population mean PSS = 21.5) with evidence that perceived stress may be modestly above the mean. Crucially, the strongest elevated indicators for Participant 2 (PSQI, pain measures) have substantially larger correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.58; pain r ≈ 0.52–0.56) than Participant 1’s sleep/circadian risk signals. Although Participant 2 has important protective traits (very low GAD-7, good circadian stability, low RHR), the primary risk signals are both stronger predictors of PSS and more severe in magnitude than Participant 1’s risk signals.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: majority of strong indicators point toward lower-than-mean perceived stress; risk signals (sleep/circadian irregularity, alcohol) are present but comparatively weaker predictors of PSS in this sample.
- Participant 2: mixed profile but with pronounced, strongly PSS-related risk factors (very high PSQI and elevated pain/interference) that plausibly shift inferred PSS upward toward or modestly above the population mean despite protective resources.

Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

19,87328,28,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (as noted in their within-study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep) — PSQI commonly elevates perceived stress.  
- Late median sleep start (01:26 AM) and modestly elevated nap rate (0.18 naps/day, Z = 1.21) — both weakly correlated with higher PSS in this sample.  
- Pronounced evening heart‑rate elevation (6–7 PM deviation Z = 2.62) — indicates evening physiological activation that can increase stress perception.  
- Lower health satisfaction (Z = -1.20) — a personal appraisal that can contribute to greater perceived stress.  
Note: These factors are present but generally have modest correlations with PSS in this dataset, and they are counterbalanced by multiple strong protective signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (as noted in their within-study frame)
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16.5, Z = 1.0) and objectively extreme short/irregular sleep (median 2 h 38 min; very late median sleep start 03:12 AM; high night‑to‑night variability) — PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) and the objective sleep deficits strongly favor higher stress.  
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (e.g., +13.54 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = 1.17; +9.79 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = 1.59) — overnight HR elevations correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).  
- Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) — anxiety showed the strongest positive relationship with PSS in this study (r ≈ 0.78), making this a highly salient contributor to higher perceived stress.  
- Pain/interference (PAPAS = 65) — positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.48), adding additional stress burden.  
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (interdaily stability and autocorrelation low; intradaily variability elevated) — a shifted, unstable rhythm with physiological arousal during typical sleep hours is associated with higher PSS.  
Protective factors (higher self‑efficacy, low emotional lability) are present but, per the summaries, do not outweigh the strong sleep/ anxiety/physiology signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1: The summary explicitly concludes the participant is most consistent with being below their study population mean PSS (mean = 21.63). The strongest signals (very low CES‑D and STAI‑Trait, high self‑esteem/happiness, robust circadian amplitude, low resting HR, strong social time) are robust indicators associated with lower PSS; the stress‑raising signals (PSQI, late timing, evening HR) are weaker and have modest correlations with PSS in this sample.  
- Participant 2: The summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely above their study population mean PSS (mean = 20.75). Key indicators that strongly predict higher PSS in this dataset—moderate GAD‑7 (highly correlated with PSS), severe subjective and objective sleep disruption (PSQI high, very short and irregular sleep), and nocturnal HR elevation—are prominent and mutually reinforcing. Pain-related interference further supports elevated perceived stress. Protective traits do not outweigh these strong risk signals.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1’s risk signals are present but relatively weak and outweighed by multiple, strongly protective psychosocial and physiological features; within their study frame they are inferred below the population mean.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple strong, interrelated indicators that are directly and substantially correlated with higher PSS in their study (notably GAD‑7 and PSQI plus objective nocturnal arousal), and the summary infers they are above their population mean.  
Given both descriptions are written relative to their own population means, Participant 2’s profile indicates a higher inferred PSS (worse perceived stress) than Participant 1’s profile.

- Some circadian/physiological irregularity: reduced interdaily stability and lower 24‑hour autocorrelation (negative Zs) suggesting weaker day-to-day physiological regularity, which is associated with stress-related dysregulation.

- Severe objective sleep restriction (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 27 m) and high night‑to‑night sleep variability (Z = 0.62), plus increased naps (Z = 1.24) — strong behavioral sleep risk factors that in the sample trend toward higher PSS.
- High intradaily variability (Z = 2.29), indicating fragmented rest–activity rhythms; this metric correlates positively (though modestly) with PSS (r ≈ 0.24).
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal score Z ≈ 0.94) as an additional psychosocial stressor (though its correlation with PSS is small and in this sample slightly negative).

Comparative, within-sample weighting of evidence
- Participant 1: evidence is mixed but leans toward near‑mean PSS. The strongest elevated indicator is moderate trait anxiety (STAI → r ≈ 0.31). However, multiple fairly strong protective signals (low CES‑D, high happiness and health satisfaction, frequent exercise, low resting HR/low mesor, stable sleep duration and timing) point away from elevated PSS. The profile was explicitly characterized as “around the mean.”
- Participant 2: evidence is mixed but leans toward below‑mean PSS. Although sleep disruption is severe (subjective and objective) and would predict higher PSS, the most strongly weighted predictors in this sample (very low GAD‑7; high general self‑efficacy NGSE; very low emotional lability) have large sample correlations with PSS (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65) and strongly favor lower perceived stress. The study summary explicitly infers P2’s PSS is below the sample mean despite meaningful sleep‑related risk.

Net assessment
- Participant 2 has very potent protective indicators (GAD‑7, NGSE, low emotional lability) with larger sample‑level associations with PSS than the sleep metrics that argue for higher stress; the study summary concludes P2 is below their sample mean.
- Participant 1 lacks those strong protective psychological indicators (e.g., low anxiety is absent), has a notable anxiety vulnerability and some circadian irregularity, and was characterized as near the sample mean (not clearly below it).
- Therefore, relative to their own population baselines, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit higher overall perceived stress than Participant 2.

23,74899,17,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically disturbed), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).  
- Very short, irregular objective sleep: median nightly duration ≈ 4 h 21 min and large sleep-start SD (~123 min), both behaviors linked to higher perceived stress in general.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: substantial positive heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (12–1 AM = +11.96 bpm; 1–2 AM = +14.62 bpm; z > 1) and the 1–2 AM deviation correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).  
(These sleep/nocturnal signals are the primary upward drivers for inferred PSS in Participant 1.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI trait = 52 (z ≈ +1.06), and trait anxiety positively correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D = 17 (z ≈ +0.38), with positive correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), supporting higher perceived stress.  
- Objective sleep pattern: short median sleep (5 h 58 min, z ≈ −1.52) and very late median sleep onset (~02:25 AM), consistent with reduced restorative sleep.  
- Circadian/physiological signs of instability and activation: higher intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.46), lower 24-hour autocorrelation, elevated mesor and resting HR (mesor z ≈ +0.95; RHR z ≈ +0.47), and a pronounced evening heart-rate deviation (5–6 pm +22.1 bpm, z ≈ +1.69).  
(These convergent psychological, sleep, and physiological signals consistently point toward higher PSS for Participant 2.)

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1: The strongest predictors of PSS in this sample are trait anxiety (GAD-7) and self-efficacy (NGSE), with large correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.77 and r ≈ −0.65). Participant 1 has very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 2.0; z ≈ −1.29) and relatively high self-efficacy, which are powerful protective signals indicating PSS below that study’s mean (21.21). The sleep/nocturnal risks are moderate predictors (PSQI and nocturnal HR deviations r ≈ 0.48 and 0.46) but are domain-limited and do not outweigh the strong protective trait signals in this within-sample context. Net inference in the description: below the study mean.  
- Participant 2: Multiple measures align toward higher PSS within that study: elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, disturbed subjective sleep, short/late objective sleep, circadian fragmentation, and elevated physiological activation. While individual correlations to PSS are smaller than some of Participant 1’s strongest predictors, the number and consistency of elevated indicators across psychological, sleep, and physiological domains produce a robust within-sample inference of PSS above that study’s mean (21.59). Net inference in the description: above the study mean.

Overall balance of evidence
- Both participants show sleep-related risk signals, but Participant 1’s very low anxiety and higher self-efficacy are highly predictive of lower PSS in that study and are weighed heavily in the integrated inference. Participant 2 shows multiple converging indicators of elevated stress (anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed/short/late sleep, circadian fragmentation, elevated HR deviations) and is explicitly inferred to be above the population mean in their study. Taking the within-study calibrations and the strength/quantity of indicators into account, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

4,92566,31,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong symptom drivers tied to PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; very high correlation with PSS in this sample), markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16), elevated pain/interference (PEG-3, PAPAS). These have large Z-scores and are directly associated with higher PSS.
- Low coping resources: low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), which negatively correlates with PSS and predicts higher perceived stress.
- Objective nocturnal physiological arousal: pronounced late-night heart-rate elevations (multiple hourly deviations with large Zs and positive correlations with PSS) plus late sleep onset (~01:42) and very short sleep (~4 h 55 min) — consistent with hyperarousal and poor sleep recovery that amplify perceived stress.
- Overall interpretation in-text: the integrated interpretation explicitly concludes this participant is above their study mean PSS (population mean = 20.62), with the symptom and physiological signals dominating any resilience indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Sleep-related risk signals: PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), objectively short median sleep (~6 h 17 min, Z ≈ -1.11), late median sleep start (~00:48) and elevated night-to-night sleep variability (SD ≈ 120 min, Z ≈ 0.43). These sleep features correlate modestly with higher PSS in that study.
- Some early-morning and evening HR deviations modestly associated with PSS (small positive correlations), indicating limited nocturnal/early-morning activation that could elevate perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both descriptions are written relative to their own sample means (P1 mean = 20.62; P2 mean = 21.62). P1 is explicitly characterized as above their study mean; P2 is explicitly characterized as below their study mean.
- Symptom severity: P1 shows severe clinical anxiety, very high PSQI, substantial pain interference, and low self-efficacy — all large, well-correlated predictors of higher PSS. P2 shows low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise, and low resting HR — strong protective factors that outweigh P2’s moderate sleep risks.
- Objective physiology: P1 has nocturnal HR elevations and very short sleep duration consistent with hyperarousal; P2 has a pronounced nocturnal HR nadir (indicative of good parasympathetic tone) and low resting HR, consistent with lower stress/greater fitness, despite some evening activation and sleep variability.
- Net balance: P1’s multiple high-severity, high-correlation risk indicators (anxiety, sleep, pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR activation) outweigh their circadian resilience signals. P2’s profile is dominated by protective psychosocial and behavioral markers, with sleep the main remaining risk.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
Based on the relative profiles within their respective samples and the magnitudes of stress-linked indicators, Participant 1 is much more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse perceived stress).

- High sedentary/screen time (video games Z = 4.74; TV Z = 3.17; internet Z = 2.19) — prolonged sedentary behavior can erode coping resources and is modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample.  
- Low social-trust score (Z = -2.39) — reduced perceived social support/trust can increase interpersonal strain and perceived stress.  
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:04 AM) and low exercise frequency — late timing and lack of physical-activity buffering may contribute to social/scheduling stress and reduced stress resilience.  
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular tonic activation (HR mesor Z ≈ 1.35; amplitude Z ≈ 1.72; RHR Z ≈ 0.51) — small positive correlations with PSS suggest possible higher tonic arousal for some parts of the day.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16.5, Z = 1.0) and strong PSQI–PSS correlation (r ≈ 0.47) — a meaningful contributor to elevated perceived stress.  
- Extremely short and irregular sleep (median sleep ≈ 2 h 38 min, Z = -0.94; very late median sleep start 03:12 AM; night-to-night sleep onset variability SD Z = 1.3) — objective sleep deprivation/irregularity strongly linked to higher PSS.  
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (e.g., 1–2 AM +13.54 bpm, 3–4 AM +9.79 bpm; Zs > 1) — overnight HR elevations correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38), consistent with physiological arousal during usual sleep.  
- Clinically relevant anxiety (GAD-7 = 10; Z ≈ 0.11) with very strong GAD–PSS correlation in sample (r = 0.78) — this is one of the strongest predictors of higher perceived stress.  
- Pain-related interference (PAPAS) that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48) — adds to functional stress burden.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its own population mean (P1 mean = 21.64; P2 mean = 20.75). Participant 1 is characterized explicitly as below their population mean, with multiple strong protective signals (near-zero depressive symptoms CES-D = 0, STAI-Trait = 20 with large negative Zs; high self-esteem and happiness; robust circadian regularity with large positive Zs). The risk signals for P1 (sedentary behavior, low trust, late sleep, modest HR elevation) are present but modest in magnitude and have weaker sample correlations with PSS than the protective indicators.  
- Participant 2 is characterized explicitly as above their population mean, with several strong, converging indicators that have moderate-to-large sample correlations with PSS: pronounced sleep disturbance (subjective and objective), nocturnal HR arousal, and clinically relevant anxiety (GAD-7) — the latter having the strongest sample correlation with PSS. While P2 has protective traits (higher self-efficacy, low emotional lability), these do not outweigh the strong sleep/arousal/anxiety signals that are tightly linked to higher PSS in this sample.

Net judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population). Participant 1 shows low symptom burden and strong circadian/sleep regularity that argue for lower perceived stress relative to peers, whereas Participant 2 shows multiple high-weight, stress-associated indicators (especially sleep disruption and anxiety) that point above their population mean.

9,71193,12,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (disturbed; linked to higher PSS in the sample, r = 0.46) and very short wearable sleep (median 3 h 27 min; high night-to-night variability). These are strong stress risk factors within this cohort.  
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity rhythms (z = 2.29), which in the sample trends toward higher PSS (r ≈ 0.24).  
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal z ≈ 0.94), which could add psychosocial stress (even though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Very high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 39, z = 2.67) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T z ≈ 1.85); both positively associated with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). These are large, consistent psychological signals pointing toward higher perceived stress.  
- Low positive affect/self-esteem (happy z ≈ -1.61; RSES z ≈ -1.43), which are modestly inversely related to PSS and therefore indicate higher stress.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) and low socializing/infrequent exercise (behavioral buffers reduced), which further align with elevated perceived stress despite protective objective sleep metrics.  
- Low self-rated health satisfaction and low trust, adding psychosocial strain.

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame:
- Participant 1’s strongest predictors (very low GAD-7; high generalized self-efficacy NGSE; very low emotional lability) are highly predictive of lower PSS in their sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.76 with PSS; NGSE r ≈ -0.65; emotional lability large negative z). These strong indicators of lower perceived stress outweigh the sleep-related signals when considering the observed sample-level correlations and effect sizes. The summary explicitly concludes P1 likely below their population mean (mean = 21.42).  
- Participant 2 presents multiple strong and concordant psychological indicators of elevated stress (large CES-D and STAI-T z-scores, low affect/self-esteem), and the holistic summary concludes P2 is above their population mean (mean = 21.61). Although objective sleep and circadian metrics are protective for P2, they do not outweigh the substantial psychological symptom burden.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 1: mixed profile but overall leans toward lower perceived stress than their cohort mean, largely driven by very low anxiety and high self-efficacy despite severe sleep restriction.  
- Participant 2: multiple, large-magnitude internalizing symptoms and reduced psychosocial resources that consistently point toward higher perceived stress relative to their cohort mean.

9,67177,12,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; described as “Disturbed Sleep”), which in this sample shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46) and thus tends to accompany higher perceived stress.
- Very short objective nightly sleep (median 3 h 27 min; Z ≈ −0.66), indicating severe sleep restriction relative to the sample; short sleep duration is plausibly a stressor and may raise perceived stress.
- High night-to-night sleep variability and elevated naps (SD sleep duration = 197 min; naps mean Z = 1.24), which can undermine recovery and associate with higher stress.
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity (value = 0.64; Z = 2.29), which in this sample trends toward higher PSS (r ≈ 0.24), reflecting fragmented circadian/behavioral organization that can elevate perceived stress.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale Z ≈ 0.94), which could contribute psychosocial stress (though its sample-level correlation with PSS is small).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.46) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ 0.28); both measures correlate positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31 and r ≈ 0.28), so these are direct risk indicators for higher perceived stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and somewhat shortened sleep (median ~6 h 54 min; Z ≈ −0.35) plus large variability in sleep start times, which can increase perceived stress.
- Low reported happiness (Z ≈ −1.61) and lower self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.01), constructs that in this sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate (65.2 bpm; Z ≈ 0.84), which has a small positive correlation with PSS here (r ≈ 0.13) and may reflect higher autonomic arousal.
- Lifestyle factors: minimal exercise, low social/recreational engagement, BMI ≈ 30, and low health satisfaction — collectively these reduce coping resources and are plausibly associated with higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s strongest within-sample predictors that point away from high PSS are very influential variables with strong sample correlations: low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ −0.94; r with PSS ≈ 0.76), high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 0.49; r ≈ −0.65), and very low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 emotional lability Z ≈ −1.67). These three factors carry large sample-level associations with PSS and together strongly favor lower perceived stress relative to that study’s mean.
- Although Participant 1 has severe sleep problems (objective and subjective), the sample correlations for some sleep/circadian features are smaller than the correlations of GAD-7 and NGSE with PSS. Thus, within that population frame the strongest-weighted signals point below the mean.
- Participant 2’s elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms are direct, moderately-weighted predictors of higher PSS in their sample and are complemented by low happiness/self‑esteem, elevated resting HR, and adverse lifestyle factors. While Participant 2 also shows strong circadian regularity (protective) and absence of substance use (protective), the set of psychological symptom indicators that positively correlate with PSS produces a net tendency above the population mean.
- Comparing the two participants relative to their own samples: Participant 1’s large, strongly-weighted protective indicators (low GAD-7, high NGSE, low emotional lability) outweigh their sleep-based risk signals in their sample; Participant 2’s symptom profile (anxiety/depression, low happiness/self‑esteem) is explicitly interpreted as likely modestly above their sample mean despite physiological resilience. The magnitude and strength of Participant 2’s psychological risk signals (and supporting lifestyle indicators) are more consistent with an above-mean PSS than Participant 1’s mixed-but-leaning-below profile.

3,69057,13,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population)
- Clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) in this sample, so poor perceived sleep quality is a credible stress risk.
- Pain/interference (PEG-3 ~4.9; PAPAS ~50) are above the median and correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47), so pain-related burden can elevate perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54) could reduce social support and increase perceived stress.
- Elevated mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 1.16 and 1.22) may reflect higher basal autonomic arousal that sometimes accompanies stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z ≈ +1.16), a psychological feature associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Markedly short objective sleep (median ≈ 5 h 35 min; Z ≈ −1.99) plus disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7); both are commonly linked to increased perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity (lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability), late sleep timing (≈02:08), and pronounced evening heart-rate peak (+22.8, Z ≈ +1.79) indicating delayed timing and elevated evening physiological activation—patterns associated with greater stress.
- Contextual stressor: academic decline (GPA drop), along with lower self-rated health and happiness, which likely contribute to elevated perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and evidence weighting
- Each description is anchored to its own study mean PSS (P1 mean = 21.38; P2 mean = 21.6). The narrative for Participant 1 explicitly concludes PSS near or slightly below that mean, citing strong protective factors (high NGSE with a strong inverse correlation to PSS, robust circadian regularity, low emotional lability, low substance use). The most salient riskors for P1 are sleep complaints, pain/interference, and interpersonal strain, but the strongest statistical predictor in that dataset (NGSE, r ≈ −0.63) is strongly protective for P1.
- The narrative for Participant 2 explicitly concludes PSS modestly above that study mean. Key riskors for P2 (high trait anxiety, severe objective short sleep, circadian irregularity/late timing, academic decline) are numerous and convergent. Although P2 has notable protective features (low resting HR/mesor consistent with fitness, frequent exercise, low substance use, low depressive symptoms), the combination of trait anxiety and objectively short/fragmented sleep plus contextual stressors provides a stronger signal for elevated perceived stress in that participant’s population frame.
- Relative strength of signals: Participant 1’s strongest signals are protective and linked to strong predictors (NGSE). Participant 2 shows multiple risk factors that are both behavioral (very short sleep, late timing, circadian fragmentation) and psychological (elevated trait anxiety, academic decline), producing a clearer aggregate risk for higher PSS in that study’s context.

Conclusion
Overall, weighing the within-sample interpretations and the balance of risk vs. protective factors, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Elevated anxiety/emotional lability: GAD‑7 = 9.0 with very strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.78); BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z = 0.43; r = 0.68). These measures have large sample correlations with PSS and point toward higher perceived stress.
- Substance‑related problems (BASIS‑24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75) and pain-related interference that correlate positively with PSS—additional stress contributors.
- Marked circadian instability in wearable metrics (interdaily stability Z = -1.42; amplitude Z = -1.10; low 24‑h autocorrelation), which in this sample associate with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Magnitude and coherence of risk signals: Participant 1’s risk indicators are small-to-moderate in magnitude and partly offset by sizable protective factors (high self‑esteem Z = 1.38, frequent exercise, low substance use). Many P1 risk correlations with PSS are modest. By contrast, Participant 2 shows multiple large, concordant risk signals (extreme objective and subjective sleep disruption, strong anxiety metrics with very high PSS correlations, substance problems, circadian instability). Several of P2’s elevated measures have strong correlations with PSS in that study (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.78 and PSQI r = 0.50).
- Protective factors: Both participants have notable protective signals (P1: high self‑esteem, exercise, low substance use; P2: very high general self‑efficacy Z = 1.79 and low resting HR). However, P2’s protective factor appears insufficient to offset the severity and number of strong risk indicators (especially sleep + anxiety + substance issues).
- Within-sample context: Each summary explicitly infers P1 ≈ near mean (slightly above) and P2 > mean. Given the larger z-scores, higher correlations with PSS, and more extreme objective dysfunction in P2, the inference that P2’s perceived stress is higher relative to their sample mean is better supported and larger in magnitude than the modest above-mean lean for P1.

Integrated judgment
- Weighting the size, number, and PSS-correlation strength of risk indicators, Participant 2 more plausibly exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population) than Participant 1.

- Shorter and later/variable sleep (median ~6 h 51 min, sleep start ~00:59, sleep onset SD ≈ 89 min) — later, shorter, and more variable sleep patterns relate to greater perceived stress.
- High evening/late-night internet use (z ≈ +2.19) — behavioral pattern that can exacerbate sleep problems and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation (resting HR z ≈ +0.79; mesor z ≈ +0.74) — suggests low-to-moderate sustained autonomic activation associated with higher PSS.
- Integrative note: the report concludes perceived stress is above that population mean but describes the elevation as modest-to-moderate and balanced by several protective factors.

Comparative reasoning within each study population frame
- Strength and number of high-weight predictors:
  - Participant 1 shows multiple strong, high-weight self-report predictors with large correlations to PSS in their sample (GAD-7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67; PSQI r = 0.59), plus pain-related measures that also predict PSS. The summary explicitly interprets these as driving an above-mean PSS for Participant 1.
  - Participant 2 has meaningful stress-related signals (PSQI high, late/short sleep, elevated evening internet use, modestly higher resting HR), but the trait anxiety signal is smaller (z ≈ +0.27) and many protective signals (low depressive symptoms, good interdaily stability, functional academic performance) are emphasized. The summary characterizes their PSS as above the mean but “modest to moderate” in elevation.
- Physiological/circadian profiles as moderators:
  - Both participants display relatively preserved circadian rhythm measures that act as protective moderators. Participant 1’s physiology is described as particularly robust (high amplitude and autocorrelation), which likely blunts but does not eliminate the strong self-report signals. Participant 2’s physiology is also fairly regular and is listed explicitly among protective factors.
- Overall balance:
  - Participant 1’s profile contains several high-correlation, high-weight self-report indicators that the report treats as primary evidence for elevated PSS; these indicators are more numerous and more strongly predictive in that study’s correlation structure than Participant 2’s strongest predictors.
  - Participant 2’s elevated indicators are meaningful but appear weaker or more mixed with protective factors; the report explicitly frames their above-mean PSS as modest-to-moderate rather than pronounced.

Decision (which participant likely exhibits the higher perceived stress)
- Given the stronger and more numerous high-weight self-report predictors of perceived stress for Participant 1 (especially the very high correlation of GAD-7 with PSS and the substantial emotional lability and PSQI signals), versus Participant 2’s more mixed/partially offset profile described as only modestly above their mean, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (clinically disturbed); PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.59).

- The summary explicitly concludes perceived stress likely above the study mean (population mean PSS = 20.75).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (also meets threshold for disturbed sleep), which is associated with higher PSS despite good objective sleep.  
- Elevated intradaily variability and distinct hourly HR peaks (midday and 10–11pm; z up to 3.14) that show weak-to-modest positive correlations with PSS—consistent with episodic physiological arousal that could raise perceived stress.  
- Some lower momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which modestly relates to higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1 is characterized by multiple strong, survey-based signals that have high correlations with PSS in that study (especially anxiety and emotional lability). The description explicitly infers P1’s PSS is above their population mean (20.75).  
- Participant 2 has mostly low trait symptom scores (CES-D and STAI-T well below mean), high self-esteem, robust and regular objective sleep, and low resting HR — all protective signals that the summary weighs as indicating PSS below their population mean (21.64). P2’s higher-stress signals are fewer, weaker, or episodic (PSQI = 8, intradaily variability, some HR peaks) and the summary concludes P2 is likely below their population mean.  
- Because each participant’s description is already framed relative to their own study mean, the key comparison is the balance and strength of stress-related signals: P1 shows multiple, strongly weighted self-report predictors of higher PSS; P2 shows predominantly protective indicators with only modest conflicting signals.

Weighing the evidence
- The evidence for elevated perceived stress is stronger and more consistent for Participant 1 (several high-correlation self-report measures elevated, plus some nocturnal physiological arousal), whereas Participant 2’s elevated signals are weaker/episodic and are outweighed by robust protective signs (very low trait symptoms, high self-esteem, good objective sleep, low RHR).  
- Even accounting for each person’s population mean framing, the within-sample predictors imply Participant 1 is more likely to have the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

21,79341,30,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 41). STAI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), so even a near-mean anxiety score increases risk for higher perceived stress.
- Very low momentary positive affect (self-rated “Happy” Z = -1.61), which correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.20) and indicates lower well‑being.
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:50) and somewhat short objective sleep (median ≈ 6 h 46 m, Z ≈ -0.51), which can impair coping and be associated with greater perceived stress.
- Slightly elevated intradaily HR/activity variability (Z ≈ 0.32), which has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Behavioral patterns (limited reading, high video‑game time Z = 1.71) that could reflect stress-related coping or reduced restorative activities.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or not higher) PSS score (for balance/context)
- Strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.91; 24‑h autocorrelation Z ≈ 0.98), which correlate negatively with PSS and suggest resilience.
- Low resting heart rate (48.3 bpm, Z ≈ -1.18), generally consistent with lower sympathetic tone and lower PSS (r ≈ 0.13 positive for RHR, so low RHR argues against high PSS).
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI ≈ 5, Z ≈ -0.8), frequent exercise (Z ≈ 1.07), and minimal substance use—factors tied to lower perceived stress.
- Integrated judgment in the description: overall profile likely near-to-slightly-below the study mean (PSS mean = 21.63).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 12, z = 0.46) and this measure has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — the single strongest predictor reported.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5, z = 1.32) with a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (hourly deviations around midnight–3am with z ≈ 0.7–1.0) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39), indicating physiological nocturnal arousal.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) where self‑efficacy has a strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24) strongly associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.68) and higher substance‑abuse subscale (z ≈ 1.5), which may reflect stress‑related behavior.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or not higher) PSS score (for balance/context)
- Objective sleep duration slightly above median (≈7 h 19 m, z = 0.66), though its correlation with PSS is weak.
- Lower resting HR (57.9 bpm, z = -0.64) and modestly preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation (z ≈ 0.35 and 0.64) — features that tend to associate with lower stress.
- Low pain/interference scores (PEG-3 / PAPAS z ≈ -1.1), which argue against somatic drivers of stress.
- Integrated judgment in the description: net evidence points to above‑mean perceived stress (study mean = 20.67), driven primarily by GAD‑7 and PSQI.

Comparative reasoning (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Strength and number of PSS‑linked indicators: Participant 2 shows several strong predictors that have high correlations with PSS in their sample (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77, BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.68, PSQI r ≈ 0.45), plus physiological nocturnal arousal. Participant 1’s PSS‑related signals (STAI r ≈ 0.31, low happiness r ≈ -0.20, small positive r for intradaily variability) are weaker in magnitude and fewer in number.
- Direction suggested by integrated judgments in each description: Participant 1 is judged near-to-slightly-below their sample mean (≈21.63), whereas Participant 2 is judged above their sample mean (≈20.67).
- Even accounting for the different population means, the pattern and strength of evidence point more convincingly toward Participant 2 having higher perceived stress relative to their peers than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.

21,94579,30,17,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score:
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 12, z = 0.46) — this is the single strongest predictor here given a very high correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77).
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5, z = 1.32) — substantial elevation and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight heart-rate deviations above the sample mean (e.g., midnight–2am z ≈ 0.7–1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ −0.66), consistent with greater perceived stress vulnerability.
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24) correlates highly with PSS (r ≈ 0.68), supporting a stress-related affective profile.
- (Less direct) Elevated substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ 1.5) could reflect stress-linked behaviors even if its correlation with PSS here is negligible.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score:
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 24, z ≈ +1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI = 44, z ≈ +0.27); both positively correlated with PSS (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32).
- Shorter median sleep duration (≈6 h 38 min, z ≈ −0.69) and very large night-to-night sleep variability (SD z ≈ +3.21) and late/irregular sleep timing (median start ≈ 2:07 AM, start-time SD z ≈ +1.54); these objective sleep irregularities are positively, if modestly, correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.17–0.18).
- Reduced positive affect / lower current happiness and slightly lower self-esteem, aligning with higher depressive/anxiety symptoms.

Factors that weaken the case for high PSS in Participant 2 (contextual contrasts relevant to PSS):
- Strong protective lifestyle factors: frequent exercise (z ≈ +1.07 to +1.58), high engagement in reading/music/socializing (reading z ≈ +4.24), and very low recreational substance use — behaviors associated with lower perceived stress.
- Preserved circadian/physiological markers (interdaily stability z ≈ +0.67, autocorrelation z ≈ +0.48, distinct daytime HR amplitude), which tend to buffer against perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep quality reported as good (PSQI = 5, z ≈ −0.8), despite objective irregularity.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Participant 1’s high-impact indicators (especially the moderately high GAD-7 with very strong PSS correlation, very poor PSQI, and nocturnal HR elevations) are both relatively large in magnitude and tied to measures that show strong correlations with PSS in that sample. Multiple, strongly PSS-related signals converge toward above-mean perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows some clear stress-related signals (notably CES‑D elevation and extreme objective sleep variability), but many of these indicators have smaller correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; sleep variability r ≈ 0.17). Moreover, Participant 2 has several robust protective/resilience signals (high exercise and social/leisure engagement, low substance use, intact circadian stability) that plausibly offset some stress risk and weaken the net inference of extreme perceived stress.
- In short, P1’s elevated markers are more strongly tied (by correlation and effect size within that dataset) to PSS than P2’s elevated markers, and P1 has fewer and weaker protective offsets relative to the magnitude of their risk signals.

Overall judgement:
Participant 1 more likely exhibits the worse (higher) perceived stress.

3,43794,13,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = +1.35). STAI is positively correlated with PSS in the sample and is one of the strongest self-report signals pointing toward higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate (Z = +1.50), providing a physiological correlate of increased autonomic arousal associated with stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8, Z = +0.59) combined with large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD Z = +1.25; sleep start SD Z = +0.86), which are correlated with higher PSS.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude Z = −1.76; interdaily stability Z = −1.73), and somewhat elevated intradaily fragmentation—patterns linked to irregular schedules and physiological dysregulation associated with stress.
- Lower self-reported happiness and self-esteem (Zs negative), adding psychosocial weight toward elevated stress.
- Relative population context: the sample PSS SD is small (SD = 3.67), so the cluster of moderate-to-large z-scored stress-related indicators is consistent with being above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) in this sample, so poor perceived sleep is a plausible risk factor.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) that are above median and correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = +1.54), which could reduce perceived support even if its direct correlation with PSS is small.
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z ≈ +1.16 and +1.22), which could reflect basal arousal though their correlations with PSS are weak.

Comparative considerations (within each population frame)
- Strength and direction of key predictors: Participant 1’s strongest indicator is elevated trait anxiety (a measure that correlates positively with PSS), plus multiple physiological/circadian markers (HR, amplitude, stability) with moderate-to-large z deviations in stress-linked directions. Those align consistently with the study’s PSS correlates.
- Participant 2 shows a mixture: clear risk elements (very high PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain) but also strong, highly-weighted protective factors in this sample—especially high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.41) which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.63), and very robust circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability Z = +2.13, amplitude Z = +1.73), plus low emotional lability. The original summary judged these protective factors to outweigh the risks, producing an overall inference near or slightly below that population’s mean PSS.
- Relative uncertainty and SDs: Participant 1’s population PSS SD is small (3.67), so the cluster of stress-linked signals more plausibly places them above that mean; Participant 2’s population has a larger PSS SD (7.34), and their strong protective signals are tied to some of the sample’s strongest PSS correlates (notably NGSE), arguing against a substantially elevated PSS for Participant 2.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple converging risk indicators (trait anxiety, physiological arousal, circadian blunting and irregularity, sleep variability, lower psychosocial wellbeing) and clear interpretation in the summary that the participant is above their study mean PSS.
- Participant 2: meaningful risk factors (subjective sleep, pain, interpersonal strain, elevated HR) but also strong, high-weight protective factors (NGSE, circadian regularity, emotional stability) judged in the summary to leave the participant near or slightly below their study mean PSS.

Conclusion
- Overall, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress relative to their respective study population than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

18,67192,18,31,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (based on their description, relative to their population mean)
- Strong anxiety symptom burden: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) and in this sample GAD-7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r = 0.80). This is a highly PSS-relevant signal.
- Severe objective sleep disruption and poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 13 (disturbed); median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 19 min (Z = -1.04); very late and highly variable sleep onset (Z ≈ 1.16). PSQI and sleep variability are positively associated with PSS in this sample.
- Nighttime physiological arousal linked to PSS: marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2 AM (+8–9 bpm) that have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).
- Circadian rhythm disruption associated with stress: flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.23) — pattern tied to greater stress in this cohort.
- Emotional lability and pain burden: elevated BASIS-24 emotional lability (Z = 0.33, r with PSS = 0.66) and PEG-3 pain/interference (Z = 0.44) both positively associated with PSS.
- Limited counterweights: only a modest protective signal (self-efficacy Z = 0.12) that appears insufficient to offset the above.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (based on their description, relative to their population mean)
- High internalizing symptoms that predict higher PSS: CES-D = 32 (Z = 1.95; CES-D–PSS r = 0.27) and STAI = 58 (Z = 1.65; STAI–PSS r = 0.31). These push inferred PSS upward.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), late median sleep start (~01:15 AM) and notable night-to-night variability — sleep complaints correlate modestly with higher PSS.
- Elevated tonic/evening physiological activation: high mesor (Z = 2.01) and elevated resting HR (Z = 1.62) with pronounced evening HR deviations (e.g., +16 bpm around 10–11pm). These physiological signs are consistent with elevated arousal.
- Additional distress signals: very low health satisfaction (Z = -2.03) and low BMI (Z ~ -?), which may accompany stress-related dysfunction.

Protective/attenuating factors for Participant 2
- Adequate objective sleep duration (~7 h 16 min; Z = 0.10) — likely reduces PSS impact relative to those with severe sleep loss.
- Strong circadian regularity and activity structure (interdaily stability Z = 0.91; 24h autocorrelation Z = 1.23; amplitude Z = 0.48) — these metrics in this sample are associated with lower PSS.
- Extensive social time (Z = 2.53) and low substance use — behavioral resources that can buffer perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means (P1 mean 21.17; P2 mean 21.59). The population means are similar, so comparisons are primarily about the strength and PSS-relevance of each participant’s deviations from their own sample norms.
- Participant 1 shows multiple features that (a) have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.80 and emotional lability r = 0.66), and (b) are extreme on stress-relevant objective measures (very short objective sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, flattened circadian amplitude, elevated resting HR). Many of these features have moderate-to-strong associations with higher PSS in that cohort.
- Participant 2 has large elevations on depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.65), but those measures have only modest correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.27–0.31). Several of Participant 2’s strongest numeric deviations (e.g., high mesor Z = 2.01) have weak sample-level associations with PSS, and importantly Participant 2 also shows several substantial protective signals (adequate objective sleep, strong circadian regularity, high social time) that moderate the upward pressure on PSS.
- In short, Participant 1’s deviations are both (i) concentrated in features that are strongly predictive of PSS for their cohort (anxiety, severe sleep loss, nocturnal arousal, circadian disruption) and (ii) objectively extreme (e.g., ~2+ hour sleep loss relative to typical), whereas Participant 2’s large deviations in some variables are either less strongly correlated with PSS in that sample or partially offset by robust protective factors.

Overall balance and decision
- Considering the strength of PSS-relevant predictors, the magnitude of objective sleep and nocturnal-arousal abnormalities, and the high GAD-7 correlation with PSS in Participant 1’s dataset, Participant 1’s profile is more consistent with a higher perceived stress level (greater PSS) than Participant 2’s profile, despite Participant 2’s high depressive and anxiety symptom scores. Participant 2’s protective objective sleep and circadian regularity and weaker PSS-correlations for some of their elevated physiologic markers lower the likelihood that their PSS exceeds Participant 1’s.

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29; Z = 1.63) — a moderate positive correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28).
- Mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.46) — positive correlate of PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and very high night-to-night sleep variability (SD 173 min; Z = 1.65), both linked with higher PSS in the sample.
- Marked circadian irregularity (low 24-h autocorrelation Z = -1.12; reduced interdaily stability), which is associated with elevated perceived stress.
- Extremely delayed sleep timing (~03:45 AM) and a pronounced late-afternoon/evening heart-rate surge (5–6 pm deviation Z = 2.76) — behavioral/physiological patterns that often accompany dysregulated coping and stress.
- Several of these risk indicators show moderate Z-scores and cluster together (mood symptoms + sleep/circadian dysregulation), increasing the likelihood of above-mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47).
- Pain and activity interference (PEG/PAPAS) at above-median levels; these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which could reduce perceived social support.
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), possibly reflecting higher basal autonomic arousal (though correlations with PSS are weak in the sample).
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5) — but this score is small and GAD-7 has the strongest sample-level correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so its low absolute value limits its contribution toward higher PSS here.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1’s primary risk signals are elevated depressive symptoms (Z = 1.63) plus marked sleep/circadian dysregulation (high sleep variability Z = 1.65; low 24-h autocorrelation Z = -1.12; extreme delayed sleep timing). Several of these risk features co-occur and the summary explicitly infers PSS above the population mean (mean = 21.6).
- Participant 2 does have notable risk factors (very high PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain), but these coexist with strong, highly-weighted protective factors: high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.41) which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63), very robust circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability Z = 2.13; autocorr Z = 1.57), low emotional lability, and low substance use. The study summary explicitly characterizes Participant 2 as near or slightly below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.38).
- Crucially, for Participant 2 the most predictive protective variable (NGSE) and extremely strong circadian regularity are likely to offset the sleep/pain risks in their population context. For Participant 1 the elevated depressive symptoms plus pronounced sleep/circadian disruption form a coherent risk pattern that the summary judges to exceed the population mean despite some protective markers (low substance use, low resting HR, social exercise).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple convergent risk indicators for higher perceived stress (notably CES-D Z=1.63 and large sleep/circadian dysregulation), and the summary explicitly infers above-mean PSS.
- Participant 2: some substantive risk indicators (PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain) but also strong, highly predictive protective factors (high NGSE, very high circadian regularity). The summary infers PSS near or slightly below the mean.
- Because Participant 1’s elevated affective symptoms and marked sleep/circadian irregularity form a stronger net signal toward above-mean PSS, while Participant 2’s strong protective resources are judged to offset their risks, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher PSS relative to their respective population.

15,22455,15,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Wearable circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These features are positively associated with PSS (though correlations are small, r ≈ 0.16 for IV and r ≈ -0.16 for amplitude).
- Shorter and more variable sleep: median nightly sleep 6 h 7 min (Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94); shorter/variable sleep are weakly positively correlated with PSS in this dataset.
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV/internet/music use; TV Z ≈ +2.54), which is weakly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (large positive Zs at 5–7 AM) — physiologically atypical and potentially linked to stress-related sleep disruption or early awakenings (interpretation uncertain).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 15.5 (Z ≈ +0.67) and PSQI–PSS correlation r ≈ 0.53 — a relatively strong, direct predictor of higher perceived stress in this sample.
- High pain/functional impairment: PAPAS = 81 (Z ≈ +0.93) and PAPAS–PSS correlation r ≈ 0.53 — another strong predictor of elevated PSS.
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -0.62 and NGSE–PSS correlation r ≈ -0.69 (large effect) — below-average NGSE strongly predicts higher PSS.
- Elevated nocturnal heart rate and higher mesor/resting HR (Mesor Z ≈ +0.7; RHR Z ≈ +0.61) and positive night-time HR deviations (12–3 AM Zs up to ≈ +1.38), with HR features correlated moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83) and late acrophase — consistent with circadian irregularity linked to higher PSS.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each summary is written relative to its own population mean (PSS means 21.59 vs 21.29). The absolute population means are similar, so comparisons hinge on within-sample signals (Z-scores and reported correlations).
- Participant 1: strongest, directly stress-linked measures (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, happiness/health satisfaction, self-esteem) are robustly in the direction of lower stress. Many of the “higher stress” signals are objective circadian/sleep markers with small correlations to PSS in this sample (small-to-moderate effect sizes or weak associations).
- Participant 2: several of the most stress-relevant signals are self-report features with moderate-to-large correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53; NGSE r ≈ -0.69). Physiological markers (nocturnal HR, mesor) also show moderate correlations with PSS and align with the subjective indicators. While there are mitigating features (GAD-7 lower than mean, long median sleep duration), the weight and effect sizes of the elevated signals for Participant 2 are larger and more directly linked to PSS than Participant 1’s higher-stress signals.
- In short: Participant 1’s strongest indicators point toward below-mean perceived stress (and the indicators that argue for higher stress are weaker associations). Participant 2 has multiple strong, convergent predictors of above-mean perceived stress with larger correlations to PSS.

Weighted conclusion
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study mean).

21,77711,30,17,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 52 (Z ≈ +1.06), and STAI correlates positively with PSS in this study (r ≈ 0.32). This is the strongest psychological signal toward higher PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (above clinical cutoff), which is associated with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Low self‑esteem: RSES Z ≈ -1.43, and modestly lower health satisfaction—both psychosocial factors that tend to co-occur with greater perceived stress.
- Behavioral circadian irregularities: relatively late sleep timing (≈1:02 AM) and lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.57), which can increase vulnerability to stress.
- Daytime autonomic activation: pronounced midday heart‑rate peaks (hourly deviations Z up to ≈ +1.6) that could reflect concentrated physiological activation linked to stressors.

Mitigating factors that weaken the case for very high PSS:
- Several protective physiological and functional signals (low resting HR Z ≈ -0.68; lower intradaily variability; robust academic performance; modestly above‑average self‑reported happiness; low substance use) that suggest resilience and argue against extreme perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms: GAD‑7 = 12 (Z ≈ +0.46) and this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77)—a high‑impact predictor.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 17.5 (Z ≈ +1.32), a large deviation and a substantial correlate of PSS.
- Nighttime autonomic arousal: overnight heart‑rate deviations (e.g., midnight–3am) with Z ≈ +0.7 to +1.0, and these nocturnal elevations show positive correlations with PSS (≈0.22–0.39), supporting elevated nocturnal stress/arousal.
- Emotion regulation vulnerability: BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.68), consistent with greater perceived stress.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ -0.66), supporting higher PSS.

Mitigating factors that weaken the case for very high PSS:
- Objective sleep duration is modestly above median (Z ≈ +0.66) and some cardiophysiological indices are relatively preserved (lower resting HR Z ≈ -0.64; modest circadian amplitude and autocorrelation), and pain/interference measures are lower than average—these reduce, but do not eliminate, the stress signal.

Comparative reasoning within their respective population frames
- Both participants are characterized as having inferred PSS above their population means. The comparison should weigh (a) the strength of the predictors and their correlations with PSS within each study, and (b) the magnitude of the deviations from cohort means.
- Participant 1’s strongest stress signals are moderate (STAI Z ≈ +1.06; STAI–PSS r ≈ 0.32; PSQI just above cutoff). Several protective signals (low resting HR, good academic functioning, daytime rhythm stability, self‑reported happiness) materially temper the stress inference.
- Participant 2 shows multiple high‑impact, convergent stress indicators: GAD‑7 with a very large predictor weight (r ≈ 0.77), extremely elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.32), nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS, and strong emotion‑lability association. These signals are larger in both standardized magnitude (PSQI Z, nocturnal HR Zs) and predictive strength (GAD‑7 and BASIS‑24 correlations) than the primary stress signals for Participant 1. Although Participant 2 has some physiological and somatic protections, they do not outweigh the strong psychological and nocturnal‑arousal indicators.

Balance of evidence and determination
- Overall, Participant 2 presents a more robust and convergent pattern of high‑impact predictors of perceived stress (strong anxiety–PSS link, very high PSQI, nocturnal autonomic arousal, emotion‑lability), whereas Participant 1’s elevation is more moderate and more substantially offset by resilience indicators.
- Therefore, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress relative to their respective cohort.

- The indicators linking Participant 2 to higher PSS are stronger (larger effect sizes/correlations and more salient symptom elevations) than the indicators linking Participant 1 to higher PSS, which are more modest and counterbalanced by several protective factors.
- Both summaries are relative to different population means, but each description’s internal weighting already accounts for the sample-specific correlations. Within those frames, Participant 2 is more clearly displaced above their study mean than Participant 1 is above theirs.

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33, Z = +2.05), which in this sample are positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.27).
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, Z = +3.83), a strong and salient correlate of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.56) and low current happiness (Z ≈ -1.61), both consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Wearable signs of greater physiological arousal / rhythm fragmentation (resting HR Z ≈ +0.65; intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.81), which modestly correlate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Overall summary in the description explicitly interprets the profile as above the study mean (and “moderately elevated”).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Large, objective sleep abnormality: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 30 min and very late sleep timing — an extreme deviation that is strongly plausibly linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5) — a variable with a substantial sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian robustness (reduced amplitude, reduced 24-h autocorrelation) — physiological patterns that in this sample are meaningfully associated with higher PSS (nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.43).
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is most consistent with being above the study mean, based principally on these convergent sleep/pain/nocturnal-arousal signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as above their respective population means. The decision hinges on which profile shows stronger, more PSS-relevant deviations after accounting for protective factors described.
- Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z +3.83) and clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z +2.05). However, Participant 1 also shows several protective/mitigating features (objectively long and consistent sleep duration Z ≈ +1.22, regular exercise Z ≈ +1.07, moderate social time Z ≈ +0.95, minimal substance use). Many of Participant 1’s physiological deviations are modest (HR and circadian fragmentation Zs ≲ +0.8) and the sample correlations for depression and trait anxiety with PSS are relatively modest (r ≈ 0.27–0.31).
- Participant 2’s risk profile includes multiple, concordant indicators that (a) are large in magnitude (very short objective sleep), and (b) have moderate-to-strong sample-level associations with PSS (subjective sleep r ≈ 0.48; pain r ≈ 0.5; nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.43). These signals are tightly aligned (disturbed sleep + physiological nocturnal arousal + pain), increasing the plausibility of a higher PSS. Participant 2 does have substantial protective factors (low GAD-7 Z ≈ -0.85 with a strong correlation to PSS, r ≈ 0.77; high self-efficacy Z ≈ +0.86, r ≈ -0.64; low emotional lability Z ≈ -0.97), which reduce certainty that PSS is very high, but they do not eliminate the impact of the extreme sleep restriction and pain signals.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Participant 1: Above-mean PSS is likely (description says “moderately elevated”), but several tangible protective behaviors and some objective sleep preservation temper the net risk.
- Participant 2: Above-mean PSS is also likely; the profile includes extreme objective sleep deprivation plus convergent pain and nocturnal-arousal signals that are each moderately-to-strongly associated with PSS in the sample. Those risk signals are large and mutually reinforcing, making the overall estimated perceived stress higher than for Participant 1 despite Participant 2’s notable psychological protections.

5,21793,14,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Markedly disturbed sleep timing and circadian instability: PSQI = 9 (Z ≈ +1.05), very late median sleep start (~03:36 AM) and start-time SD Z ≈ +1.04, interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.98 and IV Z ≈ +0.95 — all of which are positively associated with PSS in that sample.
- Frequent napping (mean naps Z ≈ +3.05), which co-occurs with fragmented nocturnal sleep and weakly correlates with higher PSS.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.17) and mildly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ +0.18); STAI has a relatively strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ +0.31).
- Recent academic stressor (drop in GPA) and lower engagement in some restorative activities (reading Z ≈ -0.67), which could contribute to perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Extremely severe and irregular sleep disruption: PSQI = 13.5 (strong PSS correlate r = 0.50), objective median sleep ≈ 3 h 4 min (very short), and massive night-to-night start-time variability (SD = 401 min, Z ≈ +2.82). These are highly weighted predictors of higher PSS in that dataset.
- Strong anxiety and affective instability signals: GAD-7 = 9 with very high correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ +0.78); BASIS-24 emotional lability elevated (Z ≈ +0.43; r ≈ +0.68).
- Substance-related problems (BASIS-24 substance Z ≈ +1.75) and pain-related interference that correlate positively with PSS — additional contributors to elevated perceived stress.
- Circadian/rhythm metrics also show reduced regularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.42; amplitude Z ≈ -1.10), reinforcing the sleep/stress signal.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both descriptions infer PSS above their respective sample means. However, the strength and extremity of the stress-related indicators differ:
  - Participant 2 shows multiple, large-magnitude, and tightly PSS-correlated signals (extremely short objective sleep, very high sleep-timing variability, high PSQI, strong GAD-7 correlation, elevated substance problems). Several of these measures have large correlations with PSS in that study, so they carry substantial inferential weight.
  - Participant 1 shows clear signals favoring higher stress (circadian instability, disturbed sleep timing, very high nap frequency) but many of those effects are more moderate in magnitude and/or have smaller correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 1 also has stronger physiological and behavioral protective signals (lower resting HR/MESOR, low substance use, modest social/exercise engagement) that mute the overall stress inference.
  - The most extreme single indicators are in Participant 2 (objective median sleep ~3 h; very large sleep timing SD; strong survey correlations such as GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78), which together provide a more robust case for higher perceived stress than the moderate-to-high but less extreme pattern in Participant 1.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Although both participants are inferred to be above their study means, Participant 2’s profile contains more numerous and more strongly PSS-correlated abnormalities (particularly the extreme short sleep and high anxiety/substance signals). Participant 1’s elevation appears moderate-to-intermediate and is partially offset by protective physiological and behavioral factors.

3,87032,13,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ +1.53), and trait anxiety that correlates with PSS in the sample — both are strong psychological risk signals for higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52) plus late and highly variable sleep timing (sleep start ~02:00, start-time SD Z ≈ +1.36) — sleep problems are moderately to strongly correlated with PSS.
- Objective circadian/behavioral dysregulation: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.15), very low 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), and high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.44) — an irregular, fragmented daily rhythm is linked to worse stress-related outcomes.
- Elevated cardiac baseline and resting HR (MESOR Z ≈ +1.56; RHR Z ≈ +1.34) consistent with sustained physiological arousal that correlates (small–moderate) with PSS in the sample.
- Several of these elevated measures have moderate sample correlations with PSS, and multiple z-scores are > +1.4, indicating several concordant risk signals above the population mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Clinically meaningful subjective sleep difficulties (PSQI = 10.5) and some discordance between long objective sleep duration and poor subjective quality — PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS in this sample.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG, PAPAS) at nontrivial levels, and interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal Z ≈ +1.54) — these relate positively to PSS (moderate correlations for pain measures).
- Elevated mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ +1.16 and +1.22), which might reflect autonomic arousal in some individuals.

Comparative, within-sample weighing of evidence
- Both participants are being judged relative to very similar population means (PSS means 21.6 vs 21.38), so absolute mean differences are negligible and the comparison should rest on relative patterns of risk vs protection in each profile.
- Participant 1 shows multiple concordant risk indicators that are moderately to strongly associated with higher PSS in their sample: elevated depressive symptoms, substantial subjective sleep disturbance, pronounced circadian fragmentation/irregularity, and elevated cardiac baseline — several with z-scores around +1.5 or greater. Protective signals (good GPA, low substance use, preserved self‑esteem) are present but modest and do not offset the cluster of elevated risk markers.
- Participant 2 has some notable risk features (poor PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain, somewhat elevated mesor/RHR), but stronger and more numerous protective factors: high general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41 with strong inverse correlation to PSS), very high interdaily stability (Z ≈ +2.13), low intradaily variability, emotional stability (BASIS‑24 emotional lability Z ≈ −0.67), low substance use (Z ≈ −1.62), and long, regular objective sleep. The summary explicitly judges Participant 2 as near or slightly below the sample mean PSS because protective factors likely outweigh risk factors.
- The net balance of magnitude and number of stress‑related elevations favors Participant 1 as having the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study population.

- Clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 24; Z ≈ 1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z ≈ 0.86). Both are among the strongest psychosocial predictors of higher PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) plus very late median sleep onset (~01:44) and high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 1.32), which are associated with higher PSS.  
- Reduced circadian regularity (lower interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, low 24‑h autocorrelation; Zs ≈ -0.57 to -0.70), consistent with patterns that co‑occur with greater perceived stress.  
- Low social trust (Z ≈ -1.74) and lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95), which increase vulnerability to stress in context.  
- Study‑level framing: the integrated interpretation in the description explicitly places this participant above the study mean PSS (population mean = 21.6, SD = 3.66), described as a moderate upward deviation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ 0.67) and a very short median nightly sleep duration (~4 h 22 min) with large variability (sleep SD Z ≈ 0.89). In this dataset PSQI correlates relatively strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.53), so disturbed/short sleep is an important risk signal.  
- Substantial interpersonal problems (BASIS‑24 Interpersonal Relationships z ≈ 2.34), which plausibly contribute to ongoing perceived stress even if that subscale correlates weakly with PSS in the sample.  
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (Zs ≈ -0.84 and ≈ -1.05) and high sleep timing variability—features that commonly co‑occur with elevated stress.  
- Study‑level framing: the integrated interpretation places this participant near the sample mean with a modest tilt above the mean (population mean = 21.29, SD = 7.42), not clearly far above it.

Comparative weighting within each study frame
- Strength and consistency of predictors: Participant 1 shows multiple convergent psychosocial risk signals (depression and trait anxiety both meaningfully above average plus sleep/circadian disruption). Those mood symptom elevations are direct and moderately correlated with PSS in that sample and, together with sleep/circadian dysregulation, constitute several independent indicators pointing toward higher perceived stress.  
- Participant 2’s strongest single signal is severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance (very short sleep and high PSQI), and PSQI has a stronger correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.53) than some predictors in Participant 1’s sample. However, Participant 2 also shows several protective/low‑distress indicators (very low GAD‑7, low pain and emotional lability, near‑average self‑efficacy which is strongly inversely correlated with PSS in that sample, and lower resting HR). These protective indicators are fairly strong and are explicitly noted to push the overall inference toward “near the mean” with only a modest tilt above.  
- Magnitude relative to sample variability: Participant 1’s study has a smaller PSS SD (3.66), so deviations in the psychosocial predictors may translate into a clearer above‑mean PSS relative to that distribution; Participant 2’s study has a larger PSS SD (7.42), and the summary explicitly judges them to be close to the central tendency.

Integrated judgment
Although Participant 2 has very severe sleep loss and high sleep variability (strong risk signals for higher PSS), Participant 1 exhibits multiple concordant risk factors including clinically elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety plus sleep/circadian disruption and low social trust. Those mood symptom elevations are directly tied to higher PSS in Participant 1’s sample and, taken together with the other signals and the explicit summary judgment, provide stronger overall evidence that Participant 1’s perceived stress is above (and likely more elevated relative to their sample) than Participant 2’s, who is characterized as near the mean with only a modest tilt above.

15,89652,15,28,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ 0.67). PSQI correlates with PSS in this sample (r = 0.53), so this is a robust stress-related signal.
- Elevated pain / functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ 0.93). PAPAS also correlates with PSS (r = 0.53), providing another strong, independent stress-associated signal.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), with NGSE strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.69), which predicts higher perceived stress.
- Cardiac physiology consistent with stress: higher mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (Zs up to ≈1.38) that are positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83), suggesting irregular daily timing, which in this dataset has a small association with higher PSS.
- Overall pattern: multiple moderate-to-strong signals (subjective + physiological) converge on elevated perceived stress.

Mitigating features that temper but do not negate the above: low-to-mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5, Z = -0.76), relatively long median sleep duration (Z = 0.92), low intradaily variability (Z = -1.28), slightly lower emotional lability. These reduce probability of extreme PSS but do not outweigh the stronger stress-linked signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Circadian and sleep irregularity: very late median sleep start (02:54), shorter median sleep duration (6 h 34 m; Z ≈ -0.76), high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z = 1.62), and somewhat elevated mean daily naps (Z = 1.49). These features can be associated with higher stress.
- Elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (IV HR Z = 1.30) and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = -0.87), indicating fragmented/unstable daily structure.
- Note: in this sample these rhythm/variability metrics have only small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.13–0.15), so each is a modest risk indicator rather than a strong predictor.

Mitigating features that argue against higher PSS: very low depressive symptoms (CES‑D z = -0.86), low trait anxiety (STAI z = -0.62), high self‑esteem and happiness (z = 0.82 and 1.64), good PSQI (score = 4, z = -1.26), low substance use, regular exercise, high interpersonal trust. These subjective/behavioral markers are strongly and consistently indicative of lower perceived stress and are described as carrying more weight than the small associations of the circadian irregularities with PSS.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Participant 1: several strong stress-related features with moderate-to-large sample correlations to PSS (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53; NGSE r ≈ -0.69; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.31–0.47). Multiple converging signals (subjective symptoms + physiology) point above the population mean. Mitigating factors are present but are weaker or fewer.
- Participant 2: subjective and behavioral indicators strongly point below the population mean; objective circadian/sleep irregularities point modestly toward higher stress but have only small correlations with PSS in that sample. The profile is described as most consistent with PSS at or below the study mean.

Conclusion
Balancing the number, strength, and correlation magnitudes of stress-related signals in each within-sample context, Participant 1 shows the stronger and more coherent evidence for higher perceived stress relative to their study population, whereas Participant 2’s strong subjective wellbeing indicators outweigh their modest objective irregularities.

- Very short median wearable sleep duration (4 h 22 m) and very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = +0.89) and sleep onset time (SD z ≈ +0.34). Severe short sleep and irregularity commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = +2.34), which is a contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress even though its sample-level correlation with PSS is weak.
- Several circadian/behavioral-rhythm markers indicating reduced regularity and dampened amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude), patterns often seen with higher stress or poorer coping.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 27; z = +1.42) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T z = +0.66). Both measures have positive associations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), and these elevations are direct indicators of internalizing distress linked to higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; z ≈ +0.59) plus notable sleep timing lateness and night-to-night variability, and high nap frequency (naps z = +2.27), consistent with fragmentation that often tracks higher stress.
- Strong biometric rhythm signals of dysregulation: substantially reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.48), low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.40), and pronounced evening heart-rate deviations (e.g., 8–9pm deviation z ≈ +1.85). These physiological markers align with elevated evening arousal and disrupted daily structure, which co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral correlates (reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use) that plausibly reflect coping/time-use patterns associated with higher stress.

Comparative evaluation within each participant’s population frame
- Participant 1: The dominant stress-linked signals are sleep-related (very poor subjective sleep and extremely short, irregular wearable sleep) plus circadian irregularity and interpersonal strain. However, the participant also shows several protective/neutral indicators (very low current anxiety GAD-7 z = -1.38, low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, and lower resting HR). The summary explicitly judged the participant “near the mean” with only a modest tilt above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.29).
- Participant 2: Multiple independent domains point above the population mean (elevated depression and trait anxiety, disturbed sleep/timing and high naps, low circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, and marked evening HR elevations). While there are some protective/neutral signs (normal resting HR, adequate average sleep duration, healthy BMI, intact academic functioning), the strength and multiplicity of internalizing symptom elevations and physiological dysregulation led the summary to conclude this participant is above their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.6).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants show sleep and circadian irregularities that can elevate perceived stress. Participant 1’s strongest signals are sleep disruption and interpersonal strain, but these are offset by notably low anxiety and other protective signs, and the integrated judgment was close to the sample mean with only a modest above-mean tilt.
- Participant 2 shows convergent elevations across self-reported depression, trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, sleep fragmentation (naps), and objective circadian/physiological dysregulation (low amplitude, low stability, large evening HR deviations). These multiple, mutually reinforcing indicators provide clearer evidence of perceived stress above that study’s mean than the mixed pattern for Participant 1.

1,74899,17,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Large, concordant sleep abnormalities: very short objective sleep (median ~3 h 30 min) and clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5). Sleep disturbance and short sleep have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.48; nocturnal HR deviations r up to ≈ 0.43).
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43), and pain measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS (~0.5).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: late-night/early-morning HR elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.34) and lower 24-h autocorrelation are all associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Multiple moderate-to-strong, concordant somatic/physiological stress signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) favor an above-mean PSS inference.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait Z ≈ +1.06) and elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ +0.38). Although the sample correlations with PSS are smaller than some other measures, these are classic psychological drivers of perceived stress and are present here.
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.05) plus objectively short/late sleep (median ~5 h 58 min, Z ≈ −1.52) and circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.46; low 24-h autocorrelation), which in this sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Physiological activation pattern: elevated mesor and resting HR (Zs up to ≈ +0.95) and a pronounced evening HR deviation (5–6 pm Z ≈ +1.69) consistent with heightened arousal, supporting higher perceived stress.
- The participant’s elevated psychological symptom profile (anxiety + depression) combined with circadian/physiological irregularity provides multiple reinforcing signals of above-mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are interpreted in their study summaries as above their respective population means. The key difference lies in the domains and strength of predictors:
  - Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are somatic/behavioral (extremely short objective sleep, high pain, nocturnal HR elevations), which in this sample correlate moderately with PSS. However, Participant 1 also shows notably strong protective psychological indicators (very low anxiety: GAD-7 Z ≈ −0.85; high self-efficacy Z ≈ +0.86; low emotional lability Z ≈ −0.97). Importantly, those protective measures have relatively large sample correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ −0.64; emotional lability r ≈ 0.65), implying the protective signals meaningfully pull predicted PSS downward.
  - Participant 2’s risk signals are more psychological/affective (elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms) plus circadian fragmentation and physiological activation. The psychological elevations are less extreme in Z-score magnitude than Participant 1’s protective deviations, and their sample-level correlations with PSS are smaller than the GAD-7/NGSE correlations reported for Participant 1. Participant 2 does have several elevated physiological/circadian markers (e.g., evening HR deviation Z ≈ +1.69) that strengthen the inference of higher perceived stress. Protective factors for Participant 2 (frequent exercise, good self-rated health, high interpersonal trust) tend to have weaker sample correlations with PSS and thus are less weighty buffers than Participant 1’s strong protective psychological scores.

Overall balance and decision
- Participant 1: strong somatic/physiological stressors likely push PSS above their study mean, but very strong psychological protective factors (notably very low anxiety and high self-efficacy) are powerful predictors of lower PSS in that sample and reduce the net inferred stress.
- Participant 2: multiple reinforcing signals of psychological distress (trait anxiety + depressive symptoms), disturbed sleep, circadian fragmentation, and pronounced physiological activation yield a coherent profile of higher perceived stress, with fewer and weaker protective buffers (in terms of predictive power for PSS) than Participant 1’s protective signals.
- On balance, Participant 2’s combination of elevated affective symptoms plus physiological/circadian activation and only modestly protective behaviors is more consistent with a higher inferred PSS than Participant 1’s profile, where strong psychological protections offset some severe somatic stressors.

- Strong indicators of sleep pathology: very high PSQI (16.5, Z=1.0, classified as “disturbed sleep”) and extreme objective short sleep (median 2 h 38 min, Z=-0.94) and very irregular sleep onset (SD Z=1.3). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r = 0.47), so these are meaningful contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Physiological nocturnal arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (+13.54 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z=1.17; +9.79 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z=1.59). Overnight HR elevations have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety; Z = 0.11). Anxiety showed the strongest relationship with PSS in the study (r = 0.78), so this is a highly weighty predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Pain-related interference: PAPAS = 65 (Z = 0.19) with positive correlation to PSS (r = 0.48), adding to stress risk.
- Circadian dysregulation: low interdaily stability and acrophase shift with within-day fragmentation—patterns that, in this sample, tend to associate with higher PSS when combined with poor sleep.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep complaints: PSQI = 8 (Z ≈ 0.59; meets threshold for disturbed sleep). Subjective poor sleep can be associated with higher perceived stress even when objective sleep is adequate.
- Episodic physiological arousal: pronounced hourly HR deviations at midday and late evening (z ≈ 2.11–3.14) and elevated intradaily variability (0.68, Z = 0.95). These features show weak-to-modest positive correlations with PSS (hourly deviations weak; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.17).
- Lower momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which modestly relates to higher PSS (r ≈ -0.20).

Comparative, within-population framing and weighting of evidence
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as likely above their study mean (population mean = 20.75); Participant 2 is characterized as likely below their study mean (population mean = 21.64). That directional inference is one initial comparator.
- Strength and relevance of predictors differ: Participant 1 has multiple, converging signals that are strongly associated with PSS in that sample—most notably anxiety (GAD-7) with a very large correlation to PSS (r = 0.78) and both subjective and objective markers of severe sleep disturbance with moderate correlations. Nocturnal physiological arousal also shows moderate correlations. Those are high-weight contributors to elevated PSS.
- Participant 2’s potential risk signals (PSQI, intradaily variability, hourly HR peaks) either correlate more weakly with PSS in that sample or appear episodic. Conversely, Participant 2 has several strong protective indicators (very low CES-D and STAI-Trait z-scores, high self-esteem z = 1.66, long and regular objective sleep, low resting HR) that are associated with lower PSS.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s profile contains higher-magnitude, higher-relevance risk factors for PSS elevation (especially anxiety and severe sleep disruption) that outweigh their protective traits. Participant 2’s few risk signals are weaker and are offset by robust protective trait and objective sleep markers.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (“Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42), so perceived poor sleep could elevate PSS.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning HR Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31) — suggesting modest association between these night-time cardiovascular patterns and higher PSS.
- The description notes a discrepancy between good objective sleep duration and poor subjective sleep quality, and that discrepancy itself is often linked to distress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score:
- Very large depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 49, z ≈ +3.7) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 64, z ≈ +2.2); both positively correlated with PSS and strongly predictive of elevated perceived stress.
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, z ≈ +1.05), shortened median sleep duration (6.5 h, z ≈ -0.85), and very large sleep-timing variability (start-time SD z ≈ +2.65) — sleep disturbance and timing irregularity are associated with higher PSS.
- High levels of recreational/non-prescribed drug use (very large z-scores), low happiness and trust (z ≈ -1.6 and -1.4), and wearable indicators of circadian disruption (interdaily stability z ≈ -1.65, amplitude z ≈ -1.56, intradaily variability z ≈ +0.6) — these form a coherent cluster of risk factors for elevated perceived stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant’s PSS is above the sample mean and notes the large-magnitude self-report signals drive this inference.

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Each description is calibrated to its own study mean (Participant 1 mean PSS 21.5; Participant 2 mean PSS 21.61). Participant 1 is interpreted by the study author as below that population mean; Participant 2 is interpreted as above that population mean.
- The magnitude and breadth of Participant 2’s risk indicators (very large z-scores on CES‑D and STAI, pronounced sleep irregularity, substantial substance use, and multiple convergent circadian/sleep markers) are far larger and more numerous than the countervailing signals for Participant 1.
- Participant 1’s elevated signals are limited in magnitude and scope (primarily subjective sleep complaints and modest nocturnal HR associations) and are outweighed by several strong protective signals (very high self-efficacy Z ≈ +1.79, very low resting HR Z ≈ -2.23, low anxiety Z ≈ -1.38, low interpersonal distress Z ≈ -2.47, strong circadian stability Z ≈ +1.84). These suggest Participant 1 is plausibly below their sample mean by a meaningful margin.
- Population means are nearly identical, so the within-sample direction and effect-size indicators are the most informative for cross-participant comparison. Participant 2’s profile indicates a substantially greater elevation in perceived stress relative to their peers than any elevation suggested for Participant 1 relative to theirs.

Overall judgment:
Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress).

24,73158,33,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any):
- Pronounced early‑morning and mid‑morning heart‑rate spikes (hourly Zs up to +4.41) that, in this sample, have a small-to-moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.21–0.23). These could reflect episodic physiological arousal linked to higher perceived stress.
- Shorter median nocturnal sleep duration (6 h 11 min; Z = −1.25) despite good subjective sleep quality—sleep restriction is associated with higher perceived stress vulnerability.
- Modest sleep‑start variability (SD = 67 min) which could contribute to inconsistent recovery and stress perception.
- Lower engagement in solitary stress‑reduction hobbies (less reading/listening to music) that might reduce coping opportunities, potentially increasing perceived stress in some situations.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any):
- Very elevated generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, Z = +1.51), with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.74). This is the single strongest predictor pointing toward higher PSS.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = +1.65), with a moderate positive correlation to PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = +1.03) and pain/functional interference (PEG‑3 elevated), both positively correlated with PSS.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.44) with a strong negative correlation to PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.66), indicating reduced coping resources and higher perceived stress.
- Convergent self‑report measures that have relatively large effect sizes with PSS (anxiety, sleep, emotional lability), giving strong subjective evidence of above‑mean perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning:
- Each description is anchored to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as below their study mean PSS (many strong protective indicators, very low depression and trait anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness, low resting HR), while Participant 2 is characterized as above their study mean PSS (multiple strongly predictive subjective measures elevated).
- The strongest single predictors of higher PSS in these reports are on Participant 2’s side (severe GAD‑7 and very poor PSQI), both of which show large correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 1’s indicators of possible higher stress (morning HR spikes, shorter sleep) are weaker predictors in the provided summaries (smaller correlations, situational/episodic).
- Although Participant 2 shows several objective physiological markers consistent with resilience (stable circadian metrics, lower RHR), the narrative explicitly weighs subjective measures with larger effect sizes more heavily when estimating PSS. Participant 1’s physiology and trait measures largely align with low perceived stress, and their risk signals are smaller and more circumscribed.

Weighing the evidence:
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely reports higher perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 1 does relative to theirs. Participant 2’s convergent, high‑impact self‑report measures (anxiety, sleep disturbance, emotional lability, pain, lower self‑efficacy) outweigh the protective physiological signs. Participant 1’s profile is dominated by low depressive/anxiety traits and many protective lifestyle and physiological markers; their higher‑stress signals are fewer and weaker.

- Very severe and objectively short sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 hr and very large night-to-night sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD Z = 2.82). Both short sleep and extreme timing variability are strongly associated with higher PSS in the study.
- High subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), which correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r = 0.50).
- Elevated anxiety-related symptoms and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 and BASIS-24 emotional lability (Z = 0.43); GAD-7 in this sample has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.78).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and positive correlations of pain measures with PSS, both plausibly contributing to greater perceived stress.
- Circadian/physiological instability: multiple rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability Z = -1.42, low amplitude Z = -1.10) that in this dataset trend with higher PSS.
- Note: Protective factors exist (very high self-efficacy Z = 1.79; low resting HR), but they are described as moderating rather than outweighing the strong, highly PSS-correlated indicators above.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 24 (Z ≈ 1.11), STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86). Both are meaningfully above the study mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
- Sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), late median sleep onset (~01:44), and sleep-duration SD Z ≈ 1.32; heart-rate rhythm metrics (reduced interdaily stability, amplitude, low 24h autocorrelation) also point toward disrupted rhythms associated with higher stress.
- Low social trust and lower health satisfaction (trust Z ≈ -1.74; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95) that could increase vulnerability to stress.
- Protective factors reduce the net signal: high self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise (Z ≈ 1.07), low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.61), low recreational drug use and modest alcohol use — these likely moderate perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s population frame
- Strength and directness of PSS-linked predictors: Participant 1’s elevated measures align with the study variables that have very strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.78 and PSQI r = 0.50). Participant 2’s strongest symptom predictors (CES-D, STAI) have only moderate correlations with PSS in their sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Thus P1’s upward indicators are tied to stronger PSS-associated measures in that study.
- Magnitude of aberration (z-scores/extremity): Participant 1 shows more extreme objective disruption (sleep median ~3 hr; sleep timing variability Z = 2.82) and a high substance-abuse Z (1.75). Participant 2’s elevations are notable but generally less extreme (CES-D Z ≈ 1.11; sleep SD Z ≈ 1.32; some rhythm Zs ≈ -0.5 to -0.7).  
- Number and convergence of high-weight signals: In P1 several high-weight predictors (objective severe sleep loss, subjective sleep disturbance, strong anxiety correlate, substance issues, rhythm instability) converge on higher stress; P2 shows a mix of moderate-to-strong indicators (depression/anxiety, sleep/circadian disruption) but also several protective and behaviorally positive features (exercise, self-esteem) that are likely to blunt PSS more effectively.
- Sample SD/context: Participant 1’s study has a larger PSS SD (7.38) than Participant 2’s (3.66), meaning a given absolute deviation may translate differently into standard-score differences; however the extremity of P1’s indicators (very large z for sleep timing, large substance Z) still argues for a larger upward deviation relative to their population mean.

Balance of evidence and judgement
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population PSS means, but Participant 1 presents multiple, highly PSS-correlated and sometimes extreme indicators (particularly objectively very short, irregular sleep, strong anxiety correlation, and substance-related problems) that together weigh more heavily toward a higher perceived stress level than Participant 2’s pattern of moderate-to-strong mood symptoms partly offset by stronger behavioral protections (exercise, high self-esteem).  
- Therefore, Participant 1 is most likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Strong physiological/circadian dysregulation: resting HR Z = +2.31, circadian amplitude Z = -2.10, interdaily stability Z = -1.98, low 24-hr autocorrelation Z = -1.62 — these are large deviations and are plausibly stress-related.
- Objective sleep disruption: short median sleep (6 h 5 min, Z ≈ -1.37) and very late sleep onset (~02:34), plus PSQI >5 indicating disturbed sleep.
- Behavioral risk factors: low exercise, limited socializing, low self-rated physical health (Z ≈ -1.78), and slightly elevated alcohol frequency.
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES‑D = 20 (Z ≈ +0.7), and CES‑D has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in the sample.
- Convergence of multiple objective markers (autonomic + circadian + sleep) that together point above the sample mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe clinical anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ +1.51) — this measure correlates very strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75), making it a powerful predictor.
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -1.73, and NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.61).
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance and very short sleep: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83) and median sleep ≈ 4 h 55 min; both correlate with higher PSS.
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6, which correlate moderately with PSS and increase daily strain.
- Nocturnal physiological hyperarousal: very large positive nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83; 2–3 AM Z ≈ 2.14) aligned with late sleep onset (~01:42), supporting a night-time arousal pathway to higher perceived stress.
- These self-report symptom measures have larger correlations with PSS than many objective circadian measures, giving strong evidence for above-mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each cohort frame
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s top predictors (severe anxiety r ≈ 0.75, low self-efficacy r ≈ -0.61, PSQI r ≈ 0.47) are individually more strongly correlated with PSS than the main predictors for Participant 1 (resting HR r ≈ 0.15; circadian metrics r values typically |r| ≈ 0.2–0.3; CES‑D r ≈ 0.29). Thus, symptom-level signals in P2 are more predictive of higher PSS than many of P1’s objective signals.
- Magnitude and convergence: Both participants show some very large Z-scores in physiology (P1: resting HR +2.31, circadian amplitude -2.10; P2: nocturnal HR deviation up to +2.83). However, P2 combines strong symptom-level drivers (anxiety, low self-efficacy, pain, severe subjective sleep problems) with corroborating nocturnal physiological arousal—this combination involves measures that are both large in magnitude and highly predictive of PSS in that sample.
- Protective signals: Participant 1 has several protective/self-enhancing self-reports (lower trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, above-average happiness) that are known to buffer perceived stress; these reduce confidence that P1’s PSS is extremely elevated despite the circadian/autonomic disruptions. Participant 2 has some mitigating circadian regularity (higher amplitude and interdaily stability) but these are weaker predictors of PSS than P2’s strong symptom measures.
- Net balance: P1 shows compelling objective dysregulation but weaker correlations to PSS and notable psychological buffers. P2 shows strong, highly PSS-predictive symptomatology (severe anxiety, low self-efficacy, high pain, severe PSQI) plus physiological nocturnal arousal—overall a stronger and more directly predictive profile for elevated perceived stress relative to that cohort.

23,24029,17,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (well above cutoff) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r = 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep duration and irregular timing: median ~4 h 21 min and sleep start SD ≈ 123 min — insufficient/irregular sleep is associated with higher PSS.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated heart‑rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (z > 1; +11.96 to +14.62 bpm) and the 1–2 AM deviation correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.46). These nocturnal signals can drive higher perceived stress, especially when they disrupt sleep.

Reasons Participant 1 might have a lower PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Very low trait anxiety (GAD‑7 = 2.0) and GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.77) — a powerful protective indicator.
- Relatively high general self‑efficacy (NGSE) with strong negative correlation to PSS (r = −0.65).
- Low pain, low substance use, low resting heart rate, and strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation high; z-scores ≈ 1.8–2.0) — multiple robust daytime/trait signals that predict lower PSS.
- The profile summary explicitly infers P1 is likely below the population mean after balancing signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 21; z ≈ 0.8) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50; z ≈ 0.86); both correlate positively with PSS (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Marginally disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6) and modestly short/variable sleep (median ~6 h 46 min; sleep start SD ≈ 99 min) — these relate to higher PSS.
- Circadian/physiological fragmentation: high intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.09) and reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ −0.53); these metrics are positively associated with PSS in the sample (though with smaller correlations).
- Low self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ −1.29) — negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), so low RSES contributes to higher PSS.
- The summary explicitly infers P2 is likely above the population mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Frequent exercise (z ≈ 1.07–1.58) and absence of substance use — protective behaviors associated with lower stress.
- Low resting heart rate (54.6 bpm; z ≈ −0.42) and above‑average self‑reported happiness (z ≈ 0.55) — physiological/affective buffers against stress.
- These protective factors were noted to mitigate but not fully counterbalance the affective symptom signals.

Comparative weighting and conclusion (taking each profile relative to its own population mean)
- Participant 1: strongest signals are very low trait anxiety and higher self‑efficacy, both of which have large sample correlations with PSS (r = 0.77 and r = −0.65 respectively). These strong protective/trait-level predictors were judged in the summary to outweigh the sleep-related risk signals (which have moderate correlations with PSS).
- Participant 2: multiple trait/symptom measures (depression, trait anxiety, low self‑esteem) and circadian fragmentation consistently point toward above‑average perceived stress. Although each individual correlation is smaller than P1’s GAD‑7→PSS link, the convergence of several elevated affective symptom scores and circadian disruption yields a coherent above‑mean signal. Protective behaviors (exercise, low substance use, low RHR) are meaningful but described as mitigating rather than overturning the elevated symptom profile.
- The net evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to have higher perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs. Participant 1’s very low anxiety and high self‑efficacy (strongly predictive of lower PSS) outweigh their sleep-related risks, whereas Participant 2’s clustered affective symptoms and circadian instability produce a clearer above‑mean stress signal.

- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 21 (Z = 2.04, “severe”); anxiety is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Very poor sleep: PSQI = 18 (Z = 1.49) and objective median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min with high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min); sleep disturbance and short sleep are well-established correlates of higher PSS.
- Pain and interference: elevated PEG-3 / PAPAS (Z ≈ 2.28), which are associated with greater perceived stress.
- Emotional dysregulation: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = 2.42, indicating affective instability that maps onto higher stress.
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z = -2.29 (low coping resources correlate negatively with stress resilience, thus increasing perceived stress).
- Objective circadian/sleep fragmentation: low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, dampened HR rhythm—physiologic patterns consistent with high stress.
- No single strong countervailing risk: while some protective items exist (low substance problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, relatively low resting HR), they are fewer and described as less weighty than the convergent risk signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (meets “disturbed sleep” threshold), which modestly associates with PSS.
- Within-day fragmentation and late timing: intradaily variability elevated (z = 0.67) and late median sleep start (~01:31 AM); both have small positive correlations with PSS in this cohort.
- Some behavioral patterns that may co-occur with stress: elevated sedentary leisure (video gaming/TV), beer use 1–2x/week (z ≈ 1.01). These items have small correlations with PSS here, so effects are modest.

Comparative within-sample framing and balance of evidence
- Each profile is already framed relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is explicitly described as “above the study population mean” (population mean PSS = 20.33), whereas Participant 2 is described as “at or below” (likely below) their study mean (population mean PSS = 21.61).
- Magnitude and consistency of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple large, convergent risk indicators (severe anxiety, extreme objective sleep restriction, high pain/interference, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) with several high Z-scores and moderate-to-strong correlations to PSS. Participant 2 shows a set of largely protective indicators (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, long and regular objective sleep, strong circadian amplitude, social exercise) with only modest or small-risk signals (PSQI = 6, late timing, some fragmentation).
- Effect sizes: Many of Participant 1’s indicators have large Z-scores and/or strong correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71), whereas Participant 2’s potential risk indicators have smaller correlations and smaller Z-scores; conversely, Participant 2’s protective indicators are relatively large (e.g., objective sleep duration z = 1.61, amplitude z = 1.26) and point toward lower perceived stress.
- Net conclusion within each sample frame: Participant 1’s pattern more convincingly places them above their sample mean; Participant 2’s pattern more convincingly places them at or below their sample mean.

Final determination
- Given the strong, convergent, and large-magnitude risk signals for Participant 1 versus the predominately protective profile for Participant 2 (despite a few modest risk signals), Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ -1.01) and mildly elevated depressive symptoms noted in the summary.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16, Z ≈ +0.83), with PSQI shown to correlate strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58).
- Wearable-derived median sleep extremely short (1 h 44 min, Z ≈ -1.24) and high sleep start-time variability (start-time SD ≈ 160 min), both consistent with substantial sleep disruption (noting possible non-wear/device artifacts, but these objective signs align with high PSQI).
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.80), which are moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS in this cohort.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations indicating possible nocturnal arousal that align with sleep problems and tend to associate with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participant descriptions conclude “near the study mean,” but Participant 1’s summary emphasizes that objective physiological and behavioral resilience (very high interdaily stability Z≈+1.99, high amplitude Z≈+1.64, low resting HR Z≈-1.04, regular sleep timing, frequent exercise, low substance use) are relatively strong and likely offset the moderate subjective risk signals (trait anxiety, PSQI=6, shorter sleep). The net inference for P1 is near the mean and possibly slightly below it when objective measures are weighted.
- Participant 2’s summary also calls the inferred PSS near the mean, but explicitly notes a modest upward shift driven primarily by a large subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI=16) and elevated pain/interference; these are substantive predictors of higher PSS in that sample. Although P2 has important protective factors (very low GAD-7, good self-efficacy, robust circadian amplitude, low RHR), the combination of very elevated PSQI plus pain-related interference is described as producing a modest uplift above the population mean.
- Comparing the strength and direction of signals within each participant’s own sample: P1’s strongest signals favor lower stress (several objective circadian and fitness metrics with large positive/negative Z-scores), whereas P1’s risk signals are moderate. P2’s strongest risk signals (very high PSQI and elevated pain metrics) are explicitly characterized as substantive drivers of higher PSS even though P2 also has robust protective indicators. The summaries therefore place P2 a bit above their cohort mean while placing P1 at or slightly below theirs.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population) than Participant 1, because P2’s high PSQI and elevated pain/interference are strong upward drivers of PSS in that sample and are not fully counterbalanced by protective traits, whereas P1’s objective circadian and behavioral resilience more clearly offsets their modest subjective risk signals.

- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05) and shorter-than-average objective sleep (median 6 h 26 min, Z = -0.94); poor sleep is associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (RHR Z ≈ 1.17; mesor Z ≈ 1.14) consistent with higher baseline autonomic activation (RHR r ≈ 0.13 with PSS).
- Very large late‑evening physiological arousal (10–11 pm HR deviation Z = 5.94) and very late sleep onset (~02:22) — patterns that tend to sustain subjective sleep disturbance and elevated stress.
- High daily internet use (Z = 2.19) and modestly elevated intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.32; IV r ≈ 0.16), both of which in this dataset modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Although there are protective features (frequent exercise, no substance use, higher interdaily stability, high leisure/reading), the mix of psychological vulnerability, physiologic hyperarousal, and sleep disturbance tilts the balance toward above‑mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe subjective and objective sleep problems: PSQI = 10 (disturbed), very short median nightly sleep (3 h 27 min, Z = -0.66), high sleep‑duration variability (SD Z = 0.62), and increased naps — all of which are risk factors for higher perceived stress in the sample.
- High intradaily variability (IV = 0.64, Z = 2.29; IV r ≈ 0.24), indicating fragmented rest‑activity rhythms linked to higher PSS.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale Z = 0.94), which could contribute to stress (though its correlation with PSS is small/negative in this sample).

Countervailing reasons indicating lower PSS for Participant 2 (important context)
- Very low anxiety (GAD‑7 = 4, Z = -0.94) — and GAD‑7 is strongly positively correlated with PSS in the sample (r = 0.76), making this a powerful indicator of lower perceived stress.
- Relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE = 33, Z = 0.49), with a strong inverse relation to PSS in the sample (r = -0.65).
- Very low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 emotional lability Z = -1.67) and low pain scores, both associated with lower or only modestly positive PSS.
- Physiologic signs of preserved diurnal amplitude and slightly lower RHR (RHR Z = -0.30); some daytime HR elevations are associated with lower PSS in the sample.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Each profile is assessed relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes an above‑mean PSS and presents multiple converging risk signals (psychological vulnerability, poor sleep, elevated resting HR/mesor, extreme late‑evening HR arousal, late sleep timing, high internet use). Several of these signals are moderately correlated with PSS, and the late‑evening physiological arousal is especially striking (extreme Z).
- Participant 2’s profile is mixed: the most prominent risks are severe sleep restriction and high IV, both of which favor higher PSS. However, the participant shows very low anxiety and high self‑efficacy — two measures that have the largest sample‑level associations with PSS (GAD‑7 r = 0.76; NGSE r = -0.65) and thus strongly predict lower perceived stress in this dataset.
- Weighing the relative strengths: Participant 1 has multiple risk indicators that converge on above‑mean stress including notable physiologic hyperarousal. Participant 2 has one very severe domain of risk (extreme sleep deprivation/fragmentation) but also carries the study’s strongest protective psychological predictors (low GAD‑7, high NGSE), and the authors conclude P2 likely below the study mean.

- Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit higher perceived stress.

  - Emotional lability (BASIS‑24 = 6.33) strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.67).
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9) correlated with PSS (r = 0.59).
  - Pain and functional interference (PEG = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) with moderate correlations to PSS (~r = 0.47–0.50).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations at specific late‑night hours that correlate positively with PSS (hourly r’s up to ~0.45), suggesting sleep‑related autonomic arousal linked to stress.
- The integrative summary explicitly interprets these survey-based signals as outweighing protective signals, concluding perceived stress is likely above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), which tends to increase perceived stress even when objective sleep time is adequate.
- Late median sleep onset (01:26 AM) and elevated nap rate (0.18 naps/day; Z = 1.21), behaviors that weakly correlate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Pronounced evening heart‑rate elevation (6–7 PM deviation Z = 2.62), which could reflect sustained evening arousal and has some modest positive associations with PSS.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z = -1.20), a weaker contributor but potentially relevant.

Comparative weighing of evidence (within each participant’s population frame)
- Participant 1: multiple, convergent self‑report measures that have strong sample correlations with PSS (especially anxiety and emotional lability) point toward a meaningful elevation above their population mean (20.75). Wearable physiology provides protective signals (strong circadian amplitude, consolidated daytime activation, long objective sleep), but the report explicitly indicates these moderate rather than override the self‑report predictors.
- Participant 2: the risk signals for higher PSS are limited (mainly subjective sleep quality, late timing, evening HR) and generally have weaker correlations with PSS in the sample. In contrast, Participant 2 shows very strong protective indicators (CES‑D = 0; low trait anxiety; high self‑esteem/happiness; high circadian amplitude; low resting HR; substantial social time and no substance use) that the summary interprets as making below‑mean PSS the most likely placement relative to their population mean (21.63).

Conclusion

  - Extremely short median sleep (4 h 22 m) and large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = 0.89) and onset time (SD = 204 min; z = 0.34).
- Interpersonal strain:
  - High BASIS‑24 Interpersonal Relationships score (z = 2.34), indicating notable interpersonal difficulty that is plausibly stress-amplifying in context.
- Circadian disruption:
  - Blunted circadian amplitude (z = -0.84), low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.05), and low autocorrelation at 24 h — all consistent with weakened daily structure that commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.
- Protective/contradictory features are present (very low GAD-7, low pain, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR), but the sleep-related measures have relatively stronger direct links to PSS in this dataset.

Within-sample comparative reasoning
- Each description is framed relative to its own study mean:
  - Participant 1: overall inference is that perceived stress is likely below the population mean (21.6), with subjective wellbeing measures strongly supporting that position; objective rhythm/sleep irregularities point modestly in the opposite direction but have small correlations with PSS.
  - Participant 2: overall inference is near the population mean (21.29) with a modest tilt above it, driven chiefly by severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance (PSQI strongly correlated with PSS in this sample) and notable interpersonal strain.
- The key difference is the strength and relevance of indicators: Participant 1’s higher‑stress signals are mainly weakly correlated wearable rhythm metrics, whereas Participant 2 has several strong, directly relevant sleep disturbances (including a PSQI that correlates moderately with PSS) plus interpersonal problems. Although Participant 2 also shows protective signs (low anxiety, low pain, decent self-efficacy), the magnitude and PSS-relevance of their sleep problems and circadian dampening make them more likely to be at or above their study’s mean PSS than Participant 1 is relative to theirs.

21,69831,30,16,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed) despite long objective sleep — may increase perceived stress or reflect poor sleep quality perception.
- Late median sleep start (~01:34 AM), which can be associated with circadian misalignment and daytime impairment.
- Lower current happiness (z ≈ -0.53) and low health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2).
- Recent academic decline (term GPA 1.90), a clear psychosocial stressor.
- Very low exercise (z’s ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and high passive media/socializing (large positive z’s), behavioral patterns commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- These behavioral/subjective signals could push perceived stress above the population mean even though physiology/mood measures are protective.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12) and GAD-7 is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, z = 1.32), itself correlated with higher PSS.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (e.g., +11.9 bpm around midnight) that correlate positively with PSS, indicating nocturnal autonomic arousal/fragmented recovery.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Elevated emotional lability and higher substance-abuse subscale scores (z ≈ 1.5), which align with vulnerability to stress.
- These high-impact psychological and nocturnal physiological indicators strongly favor above-mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Participant 1’s most salient signals are mixed: objective physiology (low resting HR, strong circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability) and low trait anxiety/depression favor lower-than-average perceived stress; behavioral and subjective stressors (poor perceived sleep quality, late schedule, academic problems, low exercise, heavy passive media use) push in the opposite direction. The study summary explicitly places Participant 1 near the population mean PSS (not markedly elevated).
- Participant 2 shows several convergent, high-weight signals that are strongly associated with PSS in that population: moderate-to-high anxiety (strongest predictor), very poor subjective sleep, and nocturnal HR elevations. Although some mitigating physiological signs exist (adequate sleep duration, lower resting HR), the integrative judgment in the study places Participant 2 above the population mean PSS.
- Given that each description is relative to its own sample mean, Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as above-mean stress, while Participant 1 is characterized as near-mean with more protective physiological and mood indicators.

Weighing the balance of evidence (taking the within-sample framing into account): Participant 2 has clearer, higher-impact indicators tied to PSS (especially GAD-7 and PSQI and nocturnal autonomic arousal) and is judged by the study synthesis to be above that population’s mean. Participant 1 is judged near their population mean with strong physiological protections offsetting behavioral stressors. Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep quality very poor (PSQI = 15.5; Z = 0.67) — PSQI correlates with PSS in this sample (r = 0.53).
- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z = 0.93) — PAPAS correlates with PSS (r = 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62) — NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.69), so below-average NGSE predicts higher PSS.
- Elevated circadian heart-rate measures (mesor Z = 0.7; RHR Z = 0.61) and pronounced nocturnal HR deviations (Zs up to ≈1.38) — night HR deviations correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83), consistent with more irregular daily timing (small positive association with PSS).

Protective (reducing likelihood of very high PSS)
- Relatively low anxiety (GAD-7 = 5; Z = -0.76) — GAD-7 is strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.76), so this is a substantial mitigating signal.
- Long median nightly sleep (8 h 4 min; Z = 0.92) and low intradaily variability (IV Z = -1.28).
- Slightly lower emotional lability (Z = -0.37).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- High depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; Z = 1.95). CES-D correlates with PSS (r = 0.27).
- High trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z = 1.65). STAI correlates with PSS (r = 0.31).
- Elevated baseline/evening cardiac tone (mesor Z = 2.01; RHR Z = 1.62; evening HR deviations Z ≈ 1.55) — physiological arousal supports higher perceived stress despite modest direct correlations for some HR metrics.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and large sleep-timing/ duration variability (sleep start ~01:15, night-to-night SD ≈ 110 min).
- Very low self-rated health satisfaction (Z = -2.03) and underweight BMI (17.8) — add to distress signal.

Protective (reducing likelihood of very high PSS)
- Objective sleep duration in normative range (≈7 h 16 min; Z ≈ 0.10).
- Strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = 0.91; 24-h autocorrelation Z = 1.23) and preserved amplitude.
- High reported social time (Z = 2.53) and low substance use.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s strongest PSS-related measures (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE, nocturnal HR) have substantial sample-level correlations with PSS (notably NGSE r = -0.69; PSQI/PAPAS r ≈ 0.53). However, the magnitudes (z-scores) of those predictors are mostly moderate (~0.6–0.9). Crucially, Participant 1 also has a below-average GAD-7 (Z = -0.76) and other protective signs (long nightly sleep, low IV) — the low GAD-7 is particularly important because GAD-7 has one of the strongest correlations with PSS in the sample (r = 0.76), so that protective signal substantially counterbalances the stress signals.
- Participant 2 shows very large standardized deviations on core internalizing measures (CES-D Z ≈ 1.95; STAI Z ≈ 1.65) and on baseline cardiac tone (mesor Z ≈ 2.01). While the depression/anxiety measures have more modest correlations with PSS than some P1 measures, the magnitude of deviation (z > 1.5–2.0) on multiple PSS-relevant axes (depression, anxiety, cardiac arousal, poor health satisfaction) yields a strong aggregated signal for elevated perceived stress. Countervailing protective features (good objective sleep duration, strong interdaily stability, high social time) moderate but do not eliminate the large internalizing + physiological departures.

Net weighing of evidence
- After accounting for both effect sizes (z-scores) and the strength of association with PSS, Participant 2’s profile is more consistent with a larger elevation in perceived stress relative to their study mean. Participant 2 has multiple large standardized deviations (Zs ≈ 1.6–2.0) on measures that, even with modest correlations, cumulatively predict substantial upward displacement of PSS. Participant 1 has several moderate stress-linked deviations and some strong correlates, but also a notably protective low GAD-7 (strongly tied to lower PSS) and other mitigating signs; overall the P1 pattern suggests a moderate elevation above mean, whereas P2’s pattern suggests a larger elevation.

- Elevated affective symptom burden: CES-D = 26 and trait anxiety = 55 (both ≈ +1.3 SD), and these measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Low subjective well-being: markedly low happiness and trust (z ≈ -1.6 and -2.1), and lower health satisfaction—features that typically co-occur with higher perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance and circadian disruption: PSQI >5 (PSQI = 7), very late median sleep onset (~02:38), high night-to-night variability in sleep timing/duration (sleep SD z ≈ +1.2), reduced interdaily stability and flattened amplitude—patterns associated with higher stress.  
- Physiological signs of evening arousal: elevated late-evening heart-rate deviations (z’s up to +2.25) consistent with nocturnal arousal/stress-related activation.  
- Behavioral markers consistent with stress (increased daytime napping: naps z ≈ +2.27).  
- (Counterpoints noted in the description—long objective sleep, low RHR, regular exercise/social/leisure—are protective but do not fully offset the multiple elevated affective and sleep/circadian risk indicators.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study sample)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically disturbed), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47).  
- Pain and interference: PEG/PAPAS values indicate moderate pain-related burden; these measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).  
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal z ≈ +1.54, which could reduce perceived social support (a plausible stress contributor even if its sample correlation with PSS is small).  
- Mild physiological elevation: mesor and resting HR ≈ +1.2 SDs above mean (possible index of higher basal arousal, though weakly related to PSS in the sample).  
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5) is present but small; the strongest correlates of PSS in this sample (GAD-7 and NGSE) weigh here—GAD is low, but the high NGSE likely protects.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Participant 1’s profile contains multiple high-loading psychological risk indicators that are substantially above that study’s mean (CES-D and trait anxiety both > +1 SD) plus corroborating circadian/sleep irregularity and physiological signs of evening arousal. The study-level correlations reported (moderate positive correlations between these affective/sleep markers and PSS) support inferring P1’s PSS is above that sample mean (sample mean 21.6, SD 3.67 — relatively narrow SD, so >1 SD affective elevations are notable).  
- Participant 2 has important risk factors (very poor subjective sleep, pain, interpersonal strain), but also strong, large protective factors: high general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +1.41) which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63), pronounced circadian regularity (large positive z’s), low emotional lability, and minimal substance use. The integrative interpretation provided in the description explicitly judges P2 as near or slightly below their population mean PSS (mean 21.38, SD 7.34). The sample SD for Participant 2’s study is larger, so equivalent absolute z-scores map to smaller standardized PSS shifts.  
- Net balance: Participant 1’s multiple elevated affective measures and sleep/rhythm disruptions (and corroborating physiological evening arousal) give stronger evidence for above-mean perceived stress in their sample than Participant 2’s mixed profile (where strong protective factors—especially NGSE—likely offset the risk signals). Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- High internalizing symptoms: Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 32; Z ≈ +1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z ≈ +1.65). Both correlate positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.27 and 0.31) and are prominent risk signals.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep) plus late/variable sleep timing and sleep-duration variability, which correlate modestly with higher PSS.
- Elevated tonic and evening physiological arousal: High mesor (Z ≈ +2.01), elevated resting HR (Z ≈ +1.62), and pronounced evening HR deviations (up to Z ≈ +1.55) indicating sustained physiological activation associated with stress.
- Low health satisfaction and low BMI: Very low self-rated health (Z ≈ -2.03) and underweight BMI, adding an additional distress signal.

Countervailing signals in this participant (reduce inferred PSS): objectively adequate total sleep (≈7h16m, Z ≈ +0.10), strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation Zs ≈ +0.9 and +1.23), extensive social time (Z ≈ +2.53), and low substance use.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Severe objective and subjective sleep pathology: Very short median nightly sleep (~3.5 h) and very poor PSQI (11.5). Both features have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.48) and are large deviations from cohort norms.
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG‑3 Z ≈ +1.33 and PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43; pain measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian attenuation: Nighttime HR elevations (hourly deviations with Z up to ~+0.67; correlates with PSS up to ~0.43), reduced circadian amplitude and lowered 24-h autocorrelation—signals linked to higher PSS.
- Convergent pattern of short/late sleep plus nocturnal HR elevations suggests physiologic/behavioral stress during typical sleep periods.

Countervailing signals in this participant (reduce inferred PSS): low general anxiety (GAD‑7 ≈ 4.5; Z ≈ -0.85) which is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77), relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86; r ≈ -0.64), and low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97; r ≈ 0.65). Resting HR and several circadian metrics are near average.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Both participants are characterized (by their respective summaries) as having PSS above their cohort mean. The question is which shows stronger evidence of being further above their mean.
- Participant 1’s strongest deviations are high depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (large Zs), and elevated baseline/evening HR. However, the sample correlations tying those measures to PSS are modest (roughly 0.27–0.31 for CES‑D/STAI; physiological correlations described as small to modest). Several strong protective factors are present (adequate objective sleep, strong circadian regularity, large social support), which moderate the elevation.
- Participant 2 exhibits multiple, large-magnitude abnormalities that are known in this sample to have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS: very short objective sleep (a severe, direct stress-related marker), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI), elevated pain (PEG), and nocturnal HR elevations. Although Participant 2 has powerful protective self-report signals (low GAD-7, high self‑efficacy, low emotional lability) that are strongly related to PSS in the sample, those protections mitigate rather than erase the impact of the severe sleep restriction, pain, and nocturnal arousal—features that are both large in magnitude and have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS.

Overall balance of evidence and conclusion
- Participant 2 shows more and larger deviations on multiple features that, in this sample, have medium-to-large correlations with perceived stress (notablyExtreme short sleep, high PSQI, pain, nocturnal HR abnormalities). These together form a strong, convergent risk profile for elevated PSS relative to that participant’s cohort mean.
- Participant 1 also shows meaningful risk (notably high depression/anxiety and elevated HR), but several protective, strongly deviant positives (good objective sleep duration, robust circadian regularity, high social time) and generally weaker predictor correlations moderate the inferred stress elevation.

Final judgment: Participant 2 more likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (relative to their respective study population mean).

15,74899,15,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z ≈ +1.06). Anxiety is positively correlated with PSS in this sample and cited as a primary contributor.  
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z ≈ +0.38), which correlate positively with PSS.  
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, Z ≈ +1.05) and objective short, late sleep (median ~5 h 58 min, Z ≈ −1.52; median sleep start ≈ 02:25 AM) consistent with stress-related sleep disturbance.  
- Circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.46; reduced 24-h autocorrelation Z ≈ −0.19) aligning with higher PSS in the sample.  
- Physiological arousal signatures: elevated mesor and resting HR (Zs ≈ +0.95 and +0.47) and a pronounced evening HR deviation (5–6 pm Z ≈ +1.69) suggesting sustained activation.  
- Holistic integration: multiple moderately elevated psychological, sleep, circadian, and physiological indicators converge to support an above-mean PSS inference.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5, Z ≈ +0.67); PSQI shows a strong positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.53).  
- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81, Z ≈ +0.93), which also correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62); NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.69), so below-average NGSE strongly predicts higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations (Zs up to ≈ +1.38) and higher mesor/RHR (Z ≈ +0.7 and +0.61); nocturnal HR deviations correlate moderately–strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).  
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83), indicating less day-to-day regularity, which is modestly associated with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means, but the nature and predictive strength of the indicators differ.  
- Participant 1’s elevated signals (anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening HR elevation) are numerous and coherent, but many of these predictors have modest sample-level correlations with PSS (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16; resting HR r ≈ 0.13). Some fairly strong z-scores are present (e.g., evening HR deviation Z ≈ +1.69, sleep onset late Z ≈ −1.52), but several strong protective factors (exercise Z ≈ +1.07, self-rated physical health Z ≈ +1.30, interpersonal trust Z ≈ +1.79) mitigate risk.  
- Participant 2 has several risk indicators that, in this sample, have larger associations with PSS (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53 each; NGSE r ≈ −0.69; nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.47). Although Participant 2 also has protective features (low GAD-7 Z ≈ −0.76, long nightly sleep Z ≈ +0.92, low intradaily variability Z ≈ −1.28), the predictors that remain elevated (pain, poor subjective sleep, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR elevations) are both meaningfully above the sample mean and have relatively strong sample-level links to PSS.

Overall balance of evidence
- Taking into account both the magnitude of deviations (z-scores) and the sample-level predictive strength (correlations with PSS), Participant 2’s elevated features (particularly pain, poor subjective sleep, and low self-efficacy, plus nocturnal HR elevations) are more strongly tied to higher PSS in this dataset than Participant 1’s constellation of moderately predictive indicators.  
- Although Participant 1 shows clear above-mean risk signals (notably anxiety and disturbed sleep) and some sizable physiological deviations, many of those predictors have weaker associations with PSS in the sample and several robust protective factors are present.  
- Therefore, relative to their own study populations, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Trait anxiety and negative affect: STAI–Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27; classified “anxious”); lower happiness and health satisfaction (health satisfaction z ≈ −1.11).
- Late / somewhat short and variable sleep: median sleep ≈ 6 h 51 min (z ≈ −0.42), median sleep start ~00:59, sleep-start SD ≈ 89 min — later/shorter/variable sleep patterns tend to relate to higher PSS.
- High evening/late-night internet use: internet use >4 hours (z ≈ +2.19) — large positive deviation that can worsen sleep and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation: resting HR 64.8 bpm (z ≈ +0.79), mesor HR z ≈ +0.74 — suggests low-to-moderate autonomic activation associated (weakly) with higher PSS.

Protective/contradictory signals that limit how high PSS is likely to be:
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 8, z ≈ −0.55), solid academic functioning (GPA ≈ 3.4).
- Good interdaily circadian stability and autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.83 and +0.81), little napping (z ≈ −0.86), exercise/social engagement — these correlate with lower PSS in the sample.
Overall assessment relative to sample mean: above mean PSS but likely only modest-to-moderately elevated; several high-weight predictors (PSQI, anxiety) are present but some strong protective factors counterbalance.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 16.5 (z = +1.0) — large and relevant contributor; PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Extreme objective sleep disruption: median nightly sleep 2 h 38 min (z ≈ −0.94), very late median sleep start 03:12 AM, very high night-to-night sleep onset variability (SD 281 min, z ≈ +1.3). These indicate severe short/irregular sleep patterns strongly linked to higher PSS.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., 1–2 AM +13.5 bpm, z ≈ +1.17; 3–4 AM +9.8 bpm, z ≈ +1.59) — overnight elevations that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety; z ≈ +0.11) — importantly, GAD-7 correlates very strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.78), so even moderate anxiety is a high-weight predictor of higher PSS.
- Pain-related interference: PAPAS = 65 (z ≈ +0.19) — positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.48), providing additional upward pressure on perceived stress.

Protective/contradictory signals:
- Above-average self-efficacy (z ≈ +0.3) and low emotional lability (z ≈ −0.97) — both strongly associated with lower PSS in the sample (notably self-efficacy r ≈ −0.68 and emotional lability r ≈ +0.72), so these are meaningful buffers.
- Daytime cardiovascular measures are not consistently indicative of elevated stress (mesor and RHR slightly above mean but weakly/negatively correlated with PSS).
Overall assessment relative to sample mean: profile is above mean PSS and shows several high-weight contributors (severe objective sleep loss/irregularity, nocturnal HR arousal, and clinically relevant anxiety) that point toward a substantive elevation in perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Both participants are interpreted as above their respective study means. To decide which likely has the higher absolute perceived stress, weigh (a) severity of indicators relative to each sample, and (b) which indicators have stronger correlations with PSS in each sample.
- High-weight predictors and their presence:
  - For Participant 1, the strongest issues are poor subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ +1.05), elevated trait anxiety (z ≈ +0.27), marked late-night internet use (z ≈ +2.19), and modestly elevated resting HR (z ≈ +0.74). However, several protective factors (low depression, strong interdaily stability, social/exercise engagement) mitigate risk; many of Participant 1’s physiological/circadian measures have only small correlations with PSS.
  - For Participant 2, there is convergence of several high-weight contributors: severe objective and subjective sleep disruption (PSQI z ≈ +1.0; extremely short median sleep z ≈ −0.94; sleep onset variability z ≈ +1.3), nocturnal HR arousal (z up to ≈ +1.59) that moderately correlates with PSS, and clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 crossing screening threshold) — and GAD-7 has the strongest correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.78). While Participant 2 also has protective traits (self-efficacy, low lability), the most strongly PSS-associated markers are more numerous and more extreme for Participant 2.
- Relative magnitude: Participant 2 shows more extreme disruption in core domains that are strongly tied to PSS (objective sleep deprivation/irregularity + nocturnal physiological arousal + moderate anxiety with high PSS correlation). Participant 1’s signals are mixed and generally less extreme; many of their physiological/circadian signals correlate weakly with PSS and several robust protective factors exist.

Final determination
Given the stronger and more numerous high-weight indicators of perceived stress in Participant 2 (notably severe objective sleep loss and irregularity, nocturnal physiological arousal, and clinically relevant anxiety that has a very strong sample-level correlation with PSS), Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

23,97596,17,32,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their profile)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33; Z = +2.05). Depression is positively associated with PSS in the sample and is a strong indicator of internal distress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z ≈ +0.56), which also correlates positively with PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15; Z = +3.83) — subjective sleep disturbance commonly co-occurs with and amplifies perceived stress.
- Low current happiness and below-average self-esteem — affective vulnerabilities that align with higher perceived stress.
- Physiological corroboration: mildly elevated resting heart rate (RHR Z ≈ +0.65) and increased intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +0.81), suggesting greater physiological arousal and within-day fragmentation associated with higher PSS.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is most consistent with above-mean perceived stress for their study (population mean PSS = 21.59).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their profile)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), which correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) and large variability in sleep timing — chronic short/irregular sleep can raise perceived stress.
- Substantial overnight heart-rate deviations around midnight–2 AM (e.g., +12 to +15 bpm) with the 1–2 AM deviation moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.46), indicating nocturnal physiological arousal tied to higher PSS.
- The sleep-related signals are the primary risk indicators in this participant’s profile.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame and weighing of evidence
- Participant 1: Multiple converging indicators (clinically elevated depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, extremely poor subjective sleep, lower happiness/self-esteem, plus physiological arousal/fragmentation) point toward higher-than-average PSS relative to their population mean (21.59). Protective factors (long objective sleep, regular exercise, social time, low substance use) are present but described as insufficient to offset the risk signals.
- Participant 2: The profile is mixed. Sleep-related indicators (short objective sleep, high PSQI, nocturnal HR elevations) point toward elevated PSS, but strong protective signals weigh heavily in the other direction: very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 2; highly predictive given r ≈ 0.77), relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE; r ≈ -0.65), low resting HR, and strong interdaily stability. The summary explicitly infers below-mean PSS for this person (population mean = 21.21), noting that trait measures with large correlations to PSS drive the inference downward despite sleep risk.
- Relative strength of predictors: For Participant 2 the trait measures (especially very low GAD-7 and higher NGSE) have larger correlations with PSS in the sample than some of the sleep metrics, making them more influential in inferring a lower PSS. For Participant 1, multiple affective and sleep signals converge on higher stress without comparably strong protective trait signals.

Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Shorter-than-average sleep for the sample (median ≈ 6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated sleep variability—both weakly positively correlated with PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV Z ≈ +2.54) and unusual large early-morning HR deviations (5–7 AM Zs +6.2, +4.3) that are physiologically atypical and could be linked to stress or behavioral patterns.

Comparative, within-sample weighing of evidence
- Both participant summaries conclude the individual is likely below their respective population mean PSS. So we are comparing two people who are each inferred to be relatively lower-stress within their own samples.
- Strength and magnitude of risk signals differ. Participant 1’s sleep-related risk signals are very large in absolute magnitude (very high PSQI, extremely short objective sleep, notable nocturnal HR elevations) and have moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ .46–.48). Those signals are severe enough to plausibly raise perceived stress substantially despite protective daytime measures.
- Participant 1 also has strong protective trait signals (very low GAD-7, higher self-efficacy) that are strongly predictive of lower PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ .77; NGSE r ≈ -.65), which argue for lower PSS. This makes their profile mixed but with extreme sleep pathology on one side.
- Participant 2’s adverse signals are milder: circadian/blunted-amplitude and somewhat short sleep (6+ hours) are present but have small-to-modest correlations with PSS in the sample (r values ~0.15–0.3 or lower). Their self-report affective/well-being measures (low trait anxiety, high happiness/health satisfaction) favor lower PSS but have smaller correlations with PSS than Participant 1’s GAD/NGSE do.
- Overall, Participant 1’s objective/sleep disturbances are more severe in magnitude than Participant 2’s objective disturbances. Although Participant 1 has stronger protective trait scores (which argue for lower PSS), the extreme sleep deficits and nocturnal arousal are sufficiently large and moderately correlated with PSS to make Participant 1 the more likely to have the higher perceived stress when comparing the two.

5,19245,14,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Very poor and highly irregular sleep: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), median wearable sleep ≈ 3 h 4 min, very large sleep-start SD (Z = +2.82). Short sleep and timing instability are strongly linked to higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated anxiety-related and affective symptoms: GAD-7 = 9.0 (mild) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability (Z = +0.43); these measures have very strong positive correlations with PSS in the study (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse (Z = +1.75) and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS.
- Circadian instability and reduced rhythm amplitude/interdaily stability (several Zs ≲ −1), which in this dataset associate with higher PSS.
- Protective factors noted (very high self-efficacy, low resting HR/mesor) are substantial but, given the strength and directness of the sleep/anxiety/substance signals (and their high correlations with PSS), they may not fully offset the stress-related indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Elevated affective symptoms: CES-D = 26 (Z ≈ +1.32) and trait STAI = 55 (Z ≈ +1.35); both >1 SD above the sample mean and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
- Low positive affect/social trust and lower health satisfaction (happy z = −1.61; trust z = −2.07), which align with higher perceived stress.
- Sleep/circadian disruption: PSQI = 7 (mild disturbance), very late median sleep onset (02:38), substantial night-to-night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.23; start SD z ≈ +0.92), low interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.82), and elevated evening HR deviations (z’s up to +2.25).
- High daytime napping (z ≈ +2.27), which can reflect dysregulated sleep/wake and associate with stress.
- Protective features that mitigate stress signals: long objective median sleep (~8 h 6 min, z ≈ +1.14), low resting HR/mesor (z ≈ −1.0), regular exercise, active social/leisure engagement, and strong academic functioning.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame and weighing evidence
- Extremity and correlation strength: Participant 1’s top stress-related indicators (extremely short objectively recorded sleep, very high subjective sleep disturbance, and anxiety/emotional lability) are both extreme in magnitude and tied to measures that show relatively strong correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78, PSQI r ≈ 0.50, emotional lability r ≈ 0.68). Participant 2’s elevated affective scores are meaningful (>1 SD) but their measures generally show more moderate correlations with PSS in that study (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
- Balance of risk vs protective factors: Both participants have protective factors. Participant 1’s most salient protections (very high self-efficacy; low RHR) are notable but appear insufficient to fully counterbalance multiple convergent, strongly PSS-associated signals (severe insomnia-like sleep, circadian disruption, substance problems, anxiety). Participant 2 has several mitigating features (restorative objective sleep duration, fitness/low RHR, exercise, social/leisure, academic resilience) that plausibly offset some of the elevated affective distress and circadian irregularity.
- Population SD/context: Participant 1’s population SD for PSS is larger (SD = 7.38) than Participant 2’s (SD = 3.67), which makes absolute departures from the mean less tightly constrained for Participant 1; nevertheless, the clinical/extreme nature of Participant 1’s sleep and substance indicators (and their high PSS correlations) argue for a stronger elevation in perceived stress for Participant 1 even in that broader-distribution context.

Overall judgment
- On balance, the weight, extremity, and high PSS-correlations of Participant 1’s adverse indicators (especially the severely curtailed/objective sleep, high PSQI, anxiety-linked measures, and substance-related problems) indicate a higher overall inferred perceived stress than the pattern seen for Participant 2, whose affective elevations are clear but are more offset by multiple restorative/protective features (long objective sleep, regular exercise, low RHR, social/leisure engagement).

7,45076,15,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within their sample frame)
- Modest elevations in trait anxiety (STAI Z = +0.27) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = +0.18), both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, clinically meaningful) and late/variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~00:57; SD ≈ 63 min), which are associated with higher perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = -0.74) and mildly increased intradaily variability (Z = +0.32), and some early-morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).
- Lower recent happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95), small signals that co-occur with higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their sample frame)
- Strong sleep-related risk signals: very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z = +0.67) and extremely short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) measured by wearable. PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.53).
- Large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep-duration SD z = +0.89) and large sleep onset variability (SD z ≈ +0.34), which are established correlates of elevated perceived stress.
- Marked circadian irregularity / dampened rhythm amplitude (interdaily stability z ≈ -1.05; cosinor amplitude z = -0.84), consistent with disrupted daily structure that often accompanies higher stress.
- Substantial interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z = +2.34), a contextual risk factor that plausibly contributes to elevated perceived stress even if its sample correlation with PSS is weak.

Comparative reasoning (within-population frames)
- Magnitude and directness of risk signals: Participant 2’s risk indicators are larger in magnitude and more directly linked to PSS in this dataset—especially the very poor subjective sleep (high PSQI with r ≈ 0.53) and objectively very short and highly variable sleep. Participant 1’s risk signals (mildly elevated anxiety/depression, PSQI = 6, circadian irregularity) are relatively modest.
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has several substantial protective features (high self‑esteem Z = +1.38, frequent exercise Z > +1, above-average sleep duration Z = +0.56, low substance use) that substantially offset their mild risk signals. Participant 2 also has protections (very low GAD-7, low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self‑efficacy, lower resting HR), but these appear less able to offset the severity of Participant 2’s objective and subjective sleep disruptions and the marked interpersonal strain.
- Net balance: Both profiles are described as “near the mean with a modest tilt upward,” but the tilt for Participant 2 is driven by large-magnitude, PSS-linked sleep pathology and pronounced interpersonal problems, whereas Participant 1’s tilt is smaller and more balanced by strong resilience indicators.

Conclusion
- Given the larger magnitude and PSS-relevance of Participant 2’s sleep disturbance, objective short sleep, high variability, circadian disruption, and marked interpersonal strain — despite some protective signs — Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their sample mean.

- Substantial pain and functional impairment (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93). PAPAS also correlates strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62); NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.69), so this is a potent risk signal.
- Circadian/physiological dysregulation consistent with stress: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83) and elevated nocturnal heart‑rate deviations (night HR Zs up to ≈ +1.38) along with higher mesor and RHR (Z ≈ +0.6–0.7). Night HR metrics have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Multiple independently correlated indicators (sleep quality, pain, self‑efficacy, nocturnal HR) point in the same direction.

Mitigating features noted in the participant’s frame: mild anxiety below sample mean (GAD‑7 Z ≈ −0.76), relatively long median nightly sleep (Z ≈ +0.92), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ −1.28), and slightly lower emotional lability—these temper but do not negate the above signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 21; Z ≈ +0.8) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z ≈ +0.86). Both are established correlates of higher PSS (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29), which negatively correlates with PSS (r ≈ −0.15) and is a trait risk factor.
- Circadian/behavioral instability consistent with stress: high intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +1.09), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), substantial sleep timing variability (~99 min SD), and somewhat short median sleep (6 h 46 min; Z ≈ −0.52). These features tend to co-occur with higher PSS in the participant’s sample.
- Multiple self-report affective indicators (depression, anxiety, low self‑esteem) converge on elevated affective burden.

Mitigating features noted in the participant’s frame: frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07–1.58), no substance use, low resting heart rate (Z ≈ −0.42), and above‑average self‑reported happiness (Z ≈ +0.55). These protective factors are prominent and expected to reduce perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population means. The question is which profile implies the higher PSS relative to their study norms.
- Participant 1’s risk signals include several measures that (a) have relatively strong sample correlations with PSS (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53; NGSE r ≈ −0.69) and (b) include clear physiological stress markers (notably elevated nocturnal HR with Z up to ≈ +1.38). Multiple moderately large Z scores appear on variables tightly linked to PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 shows clear affective symptom burden (depression and trait anxiety Zs ≈ +0.8–0.86) and circadian fragmentation, but the sample correlations tying these particular measures to PSS are smaller (CES‑D and STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31; IV r ≈ 0.15; RSES r ≈ −0.15). Critically, Participant 2 also has several robust protective factors (frequent exercise, no substance use, low RHR, greater happiness) with sizable positive Zs that likely mitigate perceived stress in that sample.
- In short: Participant 1’s risk signals are both multiple and tied to measures that have stronger associations with PSS in that study (including a very strong NGSE–PSS relation and strong PSQI/PAPAS relations), and include pronounced physiological markers (nocturnal HR). Participant 2 has important risk signals but also stronger behavioral/physiological protective factors and generally weaker variable–PSS correlations.

Weighted conclusion
- Considering the number, magnitude, and sample-level predictive strength of stress-related indicators in each participant’s description, Participant 1’s profile is more consistent with a higher PSS (greater perceived stress) relative to their study population than Participant 2’s is relative to theirs.

Final decision
{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",15,Pain,15,24029,NetHealth,30
5,18111,14,28,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 27; z ≈ +1.42) and trait anxiety (STAI = 48; z ≈ +0.66), plus low self-rated happiness (z ≈ -1.61). These self-report signals directly map onto distress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; z ≈ +0.59), late and highly variable sleep timing (median start ~01:19; sleep SD ≈ 113 min) and increased daytime napping (z ≈ +2.27) — patterns commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Blunted/irregular circadian physiology (amplitude z ≈ -1.48; interdaily stability z ≈ -1.40) and pronounced evening heart‑rate elevation (8–9pm z ≈ +1.85) consistent with elevated evening arousal.
- Behavioral signs (reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use) that often co-occur with higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Very severe and objectively extreme sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (disturbed), median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h, and huge night-to-night sleep‑start variability (SD z = +2.82). These sleep indicators have strong positive correlations with PSS in the sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50).
- Elevated anxiety and emotional lability: GAD‑7 = 9 (and GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS in this sample, r ≈ 0.78); BASIS‑24 emotional lability also positively related to PSS (r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance‑related problems (BASIS‑24 substance z ≈ +1.75) and some pain interference — both positively associated with PSS in the dataset.
- Circadian instability (low interdaily stability z ≈ -1.42; low amplitude z ≈ -1.10) aligning with the sleep/affect signals.

Comparative, within‑sample weighing
- Both profiles are judged “above the population mean” in their own samples, but the strength and relevance of the indicators differ. Participant 1’s strongest signals are elevated depression and trait anxiety (moderate z‑scores) and circadian irregularity; however, those self‑report measures have only modest correlations with PSS in that study (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Some protective signs (normal resting HR, adequate median sleep duration, good academic functioning) temper the inference.
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple highly PSS‑relevant and strongly correlated measures: objectively extreme sleep deprivation/irregularity (median ~3 h; sleep timing z ≈ +2.82), a GAD‑7 signal that is strongly tied to PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.78), elevated emotional lability (r ≈ 0.68), and substance‑related difficulties. Although Participant 2 has a notable protective factor (very high self‑efficacy, z ≈ +1.79), the magnitude and PSS‑relevance of the sleep, anxiety, and substance signals are large and point strongly toward elevated perceived stress.
- In short: Participant 1 shows meaningful distress but with more moderate effect sizes and some buffering signals. Participant 2 shows more extreme, convergent signals on measures that in this sample have stronger associations with PSS (especially objective sleep deprivation and anxiety).

Conclusion
Based on the balance of evidence (magnitude of effects, extremity of objective sleep loss, and strength of associations with PSS), Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher PSS.

13,79341,28,15,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean, 21.63)
- Trait anxiety: STAI = 41, and STAI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31). This is a direct self-report risk signal for higher perceived stress.
- Low momentary positive affect: very low self-rated “Happy” (Z ≈ -1.61) and happiness correlates negatively with PSS (≈ -0.20), so low positive affect points toward greater perceived stress.
- Shorter/late sleep timing: wearable median sleep <7 h (Z ≈ -0.51) and very late typical sleep onset (~01:50); later/shorter sleep can increase stress or reduce coping.
- Slightly elevated intradaily HR variability (Z ≈ 0.32), a measure modestly positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Behavioral patterns (high video-game time Z = 1.71, limited reading) that could reflect coping or stress-related time use.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean, 20.75)
- Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 9 (well above threshold) and PSQI strongly correlates with PSS (r = 0.59).
- Anxiety and emotional lability: GAD-7 = 7.5 (mild) and Emotional Lability = 6.33; both have very strong positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (GAD-7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67), making them powerful predictors of higher perceived stress.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55, with moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50).
- Nocturnal HR deviations that are positively associated with PSS (late-night hourly deviations with r ≈ 0.40–0.45), consistent with nocturnal autonomic arousal linked to stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean. Participant 1’s evidence for elevated stress is primarily moderate self-report signals (anxiety, low momentary happiness) but is counterbalanced—and arguably outweighed—by objective protective signals (strong interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation, low resting HR, frequent exercise, decent PSQI). The correlations tying the protective physiological/circadian markers to lower PSS are modest but consistent; the self-report signals that point up are weaker predictors in this dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.31, happiness r ≈ -0.20).
- Participant 2’s profile shows several strong self-report predictors of higher PSS (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, pain) with high correlations to PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.80, Emotional Lability r = 0.67, PSQI r = 0.59). Although Participant 2 has objectively favorable circadian/physiological markers that tend to associate with lower PSS, those wearable signals have smaller correlations with PSS (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.24, autocorr r ≈ -0.21) and the summary explicitly interprets the self-reports as carrying higher predictive weight.
- Taken together, Participant 2’s constellation includes multiple strong, interrelated self-report predictors of higher perceived stress (including pain and poor subjective sleep) that, in the authors’ integrative judgment, outweigh the protective physiology. Participant 1’s strongest signals point toward resilience or typical stress levels, with only modest subjective indicators toward higher stress.

Overall balance of evidence and decision
- The weight and strength of predictors for elevated PSS are greater and more coherent for Participant 2 (multiple high-correlation self-report measures) than for Participant 1 (weaker self-report risk signals offset by robust protective physiology).
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their peers.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (Z ≈ +1.52), and objective short sleep (median 6 h 1 min, Z ≈ -1.45) with very late median sleep onset (~03:56) and ~74 min night‑to‑night variability—sleep disruption is strongly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Objective circadian/physiological signs consistent with stress: reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63), modest intradaily fragmentation, and late‑night heart‑rate elevation (RHR Z ≈ +0.3; nocturnal HR spikes).
- Behavioral risk factor: lack of regular exercise (large negative Z for exercise frequency), which tends to co‑occur with higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong sleep disruption signals: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0; PSQI r with PSS ≈ 0.47), extremely short median nightly sleep (2 h 38 min, Z ≈ -0.94), very late sleep onset (~03:12) and very high night‑to‑night onset variability (SD 281 min, Z = +1.3).
- Pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal: large overnight heart‑rate deviations (1–2 AM +13.54 bpm, Z = +1.17; 3–4 AM +9.79 bpm, Z = +1.59). These overnight HR elevations have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Anxiety and pain-related contributors: GAD‑7 = 10 (moderate anxiety; Z ≈ +0.11) — critically, GAD‑7 shows a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.78), so even a moderate GAD‑7 score is highly predictive of higher PSS; PAPAS pain interference modestly elevated (Z ≈ +0.19; r ≈ 0.48 with PSS).
- Circadian instability: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.68), low autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.94), and increased intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.92), indicating shifted/unstable schedule associated with higher PSS.

Protective/mitigating factors (for context)
- Participant 1: no substance use, strong GPA, some social/leisure activity, interdaily stability slightly above average (Z ≈ +0.58).
- Participant 2: higher-than-average self‑efficacy (Z ≈ +0.3; self‑efficacy r with PSS ≈ -0.68) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97; emotional lability r with PSS ≈ +0.72) — both sizable protective correlations.

Comparative, within‑study-frame reasoning
- Both participants are inferred by their study summaries to be above their respective study mean PSS. The question is which is likely further above their mean (i.e., worse perceived stress relative to peers).
- Participant 1 shows multiple moderate‑to‑strong psychosocial risk indicators: depressed mood (CES‑D Z ≈ +1.11), trait anxiety (Z ≈ +0.76), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52) and objectively shortened sleep (Z ≈ -1.45). These are meaningful elevations on constructs that correlate with PSS, but several protective signals temper the inference.
- Participant 2 shows extreme sleep and circadian dysregulation plus pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal (HR Zs up to ≈ +1.59) and clinically relevant anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10). Although some trait scores (GAD‑7 Z only ≈ +0.11) are not large in z‑score magnitude, GAD‑7 has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), so moderate absolute anxiety translates into a large expected effect on PSS in this sample. Similarly, the overnight HR elevations and circadian instability for Participant 2 have moderate correlations with PSS and relatively large z‑scores, indicating stronger physiological evidence of stress relative to that study’s population.
- Comparing magnitudes and predictive weights: Participant 1’s largest z‑scores are PSQI ≈ +1.52 and CES‑D ≈ +1.11, with moderate predictive correlations. Participant 2’s notable z‑scores include nocturnal HR up to +1.59 and intradaily variability +0.92, and sleep‑timing variability Z = +1.3; crucially, the GAD‑7–PSS correlation is much higher than the comparable correlations for CES‑D/STAI in Participant 1’s study, amplifying Participant 2’s anxiety signal despite modest z magnitude. Participant 2’s combination of severe objective nocturnal arousal, extreme sleep reduction/irregularity, and the highly PSS‑predictive anxiety signal produces a stronger aggregated indication of elevated perceived stress relative to that study’s mean than Participant 1’s profile does relative to their mean.

Overall judgment
- Both profiles are above their study means, but the balance of evidence (severity of nocturnal physiological arousal, extreme sleep loss/irregularity, and the high predictive weight of anxiety in that study) indicates Participant 2 is likely further above their population mean PSS than Participant 1 is above theirs.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) so this is a plausible source of elevated perceived stress for this participant.
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations: early-morning HR values (2–6 am) show larger negative deviations from mesor and those particular nocturnal values have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These could contribute modestly to perceived stress.
- Discrepancy between objective sleep quantity (adequate) and subjective sleep quality: such mismatches are often associated with distress and could raise perceived stress even when most objective indicators look healthy.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- High depressive symptoms: CES-D = 35 (z ≈ +2.26). Depression scores are positively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28).
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 57 (z ≈ +1.55); trait anxiety here correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 14 (z ≈ +3.37), a very large deviation that commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.
- Low momentary happiness and reduced self-esteem: low happiness (z ≈ -1.61) and RSES z ≈ -0.87 align with greater negative affect/stress vulnerability.
- Behavioral markers linked to stress: increased daytime napping (mean naps z ≈ +1.9) and modest associations of sleep variability and HR variability with PSS provide additional, if smaller, evidence of stress-related disruption.
- Magnitude and convergence: multiple large positive z-scores on affect/sleep measures that are known correlates of PSS point strongly toward elevated perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is expressed relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.5; P2 mean = 21.61). Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as likely below their sample mean, with multiple strong protective indicators (very high self-efficacy NGSE Z = +1.79, very low GAD-7 Z = -1.38, very low RHR Z = -2.23, strong circadian stability and amplitude). The main countervailing signal is a moderate PSQI elevation (disturbed sleep) and some small HR associations; overall the description concludes P1 is likely below the population mean.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as likely above their sample mean, with several large, convergent risk signals (CES-D z ≈ +2.26, PSQI z ≈ +3.37, STAI z ≈ +1.55, low happiness). Although objective circadian measures are not strongly adverse and some protective behaviors (group exercise, adequate sleep duration) exist, the substantial affective and subjective sleep pathology is judged to outweigh those buffers. The write-up even suggests P2 may be near or above the sample’s upper quartile for PSS.
- Relative strength of signals: Participant 1’s strongest signals (very high self-efficacy; very low anxiety; very low RHR) are tied to strong correlations with PSS (e.g., NGSE r = -0.60; GAD–PSS r = +0.75), which strongly favor lower PSS. Participant 2’s strongest signals (high depression and very poor PSQI) are also potent indicators of elevated PSS, and several of these z-scores are larger in magnitude than Participant 1’s countervailing negative signals.

Overall balance of evidence and conclusion
- Participant 1: multiple strong protective indicators and only one notable risk (subjective sleep problems). The integrated interpretation in the summary explicitly concludes P1 is likely below their population mean PSS.
- Participant 2: multiple, large, convergent indicators of psychological distress and very poor subjective sleep quality; the integrated interpretation explicitly concludes P2 is likely above their population mean and plausibly near/above the upper quartile.
- Therefore, comparing the two within their respective population frames, Participant 2 more strongly exhibits the profile associated with higher perceived stress.

- Fragmented daily physiology: elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (z = 1.30) and low 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -0.87), indicating inconsistent daily structure.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Each narrative is interpreted relative to its own cohort mean (P1 mean = 21.6; P2 mean = 21.33). Participant 1’s strongest signals for higher stress are objective sleep/circadian irregularities, but these signals have only modest correlations with PSS in that study and are offset by multiple robust subjective/protective indicators (low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, good PSQI score, healthy lifestyle). The integrated conclusion in that description is that P1 is at or below the population mean.
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple, concordant, and strongly PSS‑correlated indicators (very disturbed subjective sleep, objectively extremely short and variable sleep, elevated anxiety and emotional lability, substance‑related problems). Although there are protective signs (very high self‑efficacy, lower resting HR), the strongest and most PSS‑predictive measures point toward above‑mean perceived stress in that cohort.
- The strength, number, and correlations of P2’s adverse indicators (especially extreme sleep disturbance and strong anxiety–PSS correlation) outweigh P1’s weaker objective irregularity signals and P1’s overall favorable subjective profile.

7,22455,15,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population):
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; z ≈ +0.67; classified “Disturbed Sleep”).
- Extremely short median wearable sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night-to-night variability in duration (SD z ≈ +0.89) and onset time (SD z ≈ +0.34) — sleep measures that in this sample correlate positively with PSS.
- Markedly elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z = +2.34), a salient contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress.
- Multiple indicators of reduced circadian regularity and dampened amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude; HR amplitude z ≈ -0.84) consistent with irregular schedule/behavioral dysregulation that commonly co-occurs with higher stress.
- Evening heart-rate elevations and blunted circadian HR amplitude that can reflect dysregulated physiology associated with stress.

Protective/contraindicating features for high PSS (for context): minimal anxiety (GAD-7 z ≈ -1.38), low pain (PEG-3/PAPAS z ≈ -1.29), low emotional lability (z ≈ -1.27), near-average self-efficacy (z ≈ -0.07), and lower resting HR — these reduce the likelihood of extremely high PSS but do not eliminate the sleep/interpersonal signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Wearable-derived signatures of circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.9), substantially blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.32); these objective rhythm features are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Shorter than average median nightly sleep (6 h 7 min, z ≈ -1.33) and elevated sleep duration variability (SD z ≈ +0.94), both linked in the dataset to higher PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure patterns (e.g., TV use z ≈ +2.54), weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Unusual early-morning HR elevations (large positive deviations 5–7 AM) that are physiologically atypical and could reflect early awakenings or stress-related arousal (interpretation uncertain).

Protective/contraindicating features for high PSS (stronger signals): low trait anxiety (STAI-T z ≈ -1.31), low-to-average depressive symptoms (CES-D z ≈ -0.14), high self-esteem (z ≈ +1.10), high happiness and health satisfaction (z’s ≈ +1.64 and +1.96), good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, z ≈ -0.8), low substance use, and regular exercise—these self-report predictors in this sample are more strongly and directly tied to lower PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Each summary is written relative to its own study mean. Participant 1’s integrated assessment explicitly concluded “near the sample mean, with a modest tilt toward being above the mean.” The largest above-mean signals for P1 are very poor/short/variable sleep and very high interpersonal-strain (z = +2.34), which are meaningful stress risk factors even though some protective signals exist.
- Participant 2’s integrated assessment explicitly concluded the participant is “likely below the sample mean,” with the strongest, most directly stress-relevant predictors (low trait anxiety, high well-being/self-rated health) pointing toward lower PSS. The objective circadian/sleep signals that push toward higher PSS are present but are described as weaker/modest relative to the strong self-report protective profile.
- Relative magnitude/consistency: Participant 1 shows two relatively strong risk signals (very disturbed short sleep and very elevated interpersonal strain) while Participant 2’s strong signals are protective (large negative z’s on trait anxiety and high well-being). Participant 2’s objective risk markers are moderate but appear outweighed by strong self-report indicators of low stress.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 1: net picture = near-mean but modestly above mean PSS.
- Participant 2: net picture = below-mean PSS.
- Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS relative to their respective study populations.

15,70125,15,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ 0.67). PSQI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).  
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ 0.93). PAPAS also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), and NGSE correlates strongly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so this below-average score predicts higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations and higher mesor/RHR (mesor Z ≈ 0.7; RHR Z ≈ 0.61; nocturnal HR Zs up to ≈1.38). Nighttime HR metrics have modest-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).  
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83), indicating less day-to-day regularity, which is modestly associated with higher PSS in this dataset.  
Caveat: Several moderately strong protective signals exist for this participant (notably a below-average GAD-7 score Z ≈ -0.76, which is important because GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS in the sample [r ≈ 0.76]; relatively long median nightly sleep duration Z ≈ 0.92; low intradaily variability Z ≈ -1.28; and slightly lower emotional lability). These reduce the net likelihood of an extreme PSS elevation and push the inferred level toward a moderate elevation rather than extreme.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 24; Z ≈ 1.11). CES-D correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.86), which is another moderate positive predictor of PSS (r ≈ 0.31). The combination of both depression and trait anxiety being meaningfully above the mean is a strong indicator of higher perceived stress.  
- Disturbed and very variable sleep: PSQI > 5 (disturbed), median sleep start very late (~01:44), and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 1.32). Sleep timing/variability and PSQI are positively associated with PSS (though correlations are smaller than some other measures).  
- Reduced circadian robustness (lower interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.57; lower amplitude Z ≈ -0.52; low 24-hour autocorrelation Z ≈ -0.70), consistent with patterns that co-occur with higher stress.  
- Low social trust (Z ≈ -1.74) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95) are additional vulnerabilities that can increase stress risk in context.  
Protective factors: high self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ 0.11), above-average current happiness (Z ≈ 0.55), frequent exercise (Z ≈ 1.07), and low resting heart rate (Z ≈ -0.61) likely buffer stress, but the mood-symptom elevations and severe sleep irregularity remain primary concerns.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Both participant summaries conclude each person is likely above their respective study population PSS mean. Our task is to judge which participant is likely higher relative to their own study mean.  
- Strength and number of high-stress indicators:
  - Participant 1: multiple moderate-to-strong stress-linked signals (subjective sleep disturbance, substantial pain/PAPAS, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR elevations, reduced interdaily stability). However, Participant 1 also has a notably low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -0.76), and GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.76). That protective low anxiety score materially counterweights some of the other stress signals.  
  - Participant 2: prominent elevations in core mood symptom measures (CES-D Z ≈ 1.11; STAI Z ≈ 0.86) and very high sleep variability (Z ≈ 1.32). The mood elevations are coherent and additive (depression + trait anxiety), and sleep/circadian disruption is pronounced. Although the CES-D and STAI correlations with PSS are moderate (r ≈ 0.28–0.31) — weaker than some of the strongest single-variable correlations in Participant 1’s description — the combined size and coherence of these elevations (two mood measures + severe sleep irregularity + reduced circadian robustness) push Participant 2 upward relative to peers.  
- Relative predictive weight: Participant 1 has some variables with strong sample-level correlations to PSS (e.g., NGSE r ≈ -0.69; GAD-7 r ≈ 0.76; PSQI/PAPAS r ≈ 0.53). But the strongest of those (GAD-7) is protective for Participant 1 (low score), lowering the expected PSS. Participant 2’s strongest signals are multiple elevated mood measures and very high sleep variability; even if each variable’s correlation with PSS is moderate, their co-occurrence increases the likelihood of a higher PSS.  
- Net judgment: Participant 2 shows a more concentrated pattern of elevated affective symptoms (depression + trait anxiety) plus severe sleep irregularity and reduced circadian robustness with fewer strong countervailing protective factors of equal weight. Participant 1 shows several stress-linked signals but also a notably low anxiety score and other mitigating features. Taking the balance of evidence within each study’s correlation structure and z-scores, Participant 2 is more likely to be higher above their population mean PSS than Participant 1 is above theirs.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",15,Pain,15,70125,NetHealth,29
9,43794,12,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55; Z = +1.35). STAI is positively correlated with PSS in the sample and is one of the strongest self-report indicators of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate (70.8 bpm; Z = +1.50), a physiological correlate of autonomic arousal linked to stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8) and large night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep duration SD Z = +1.25; sleep start SD Z = +0.86), which are associated with higher stress.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude Z = −1.76; interdaily stability Z = −1.73) and increased intradaily fragmentation — patterns commonly seen with stress-related dysregulation.
- Lower happiness and self-esteem (Z = −0.53 and −0.87), which add psychosocial weight toward higher perceived stress.
- The integrated interpretation in the profile explicitly concludes the participant is likely above the study mean PSS (population mean = 21.6).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and very short median nightly sleep (3 h 27 min), plus elevated sleep-duration variability and more naps — severe sleep restriction is strongly plausibly linked to increased perceived stress.
- High intradaily variability (value = 0.64; Z = 2.29), indicating fragmented rest–activity patterns associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated interpersonal strain on BASIS-24 (Z = 0.94), which could contribute to higher perceived stress (though its correlation with PSS here is small).

Contextual weighting and comparative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Each profile is already interpreted relative to its own study population mean: Participant 1 is described as leaning above their population mean (PSS mean = 21.6, SD = 3.67), whereas Participant 2 is described as leaning below their population mean (PSS mean = 21.42, SD = 7.28).
- Strength and number of convergent indicators: Participant 1 has multiple converging signals (trait anxiety, elevated resting HR, circadian blunting/instability, sleep variability, lower self-esteem) that all point toward higher perceived stress. Several of these signals (especially trait anxiety and resting HR) have meaningful sample-level associations with PSS in that study.
- Participant 2’s sleep metrics are severe and are important risk factors for elevated stress, but several of the strongest, high-weight predictors in that study point the other way: very low GAD-7 (Z = −0.94) where GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.76), higher self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +0.49, r = −0.65 with PSS), and very low emotional lability (Z = −1.67). In the summary these strong predictors drive the overall inference toward below-mean PSS despite pronounced sleep restriction.
- Relative evidentiary weight: Participant 1’s profile contains multiple moderate-to-strong stress indicators that are internally consistent; Participant 2 has a sharp conflict between severe sleep loss (increasing PSS risk) and several potent protective psychosocial indicators (decreasing PSS). Given the reported sample-level correlations, Participant 2’s strong protective indicators (low anxiety, high self-efficacy) are weighted heavily in the profile inference.

Final determination
- Considering the within-study frames and the balance of evidence provided in each summary, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (i.e., a PSS above their study mean), while Participant 2 is inferred to be below their study mean PSS.

24,77711,33,17,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z = 1.51) — this is the single strongest predictor here (r = 0.74) and strongly pushes inferred PSS upward.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5, Z = 1.65) — large effect and positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24, Z = 1.03) with a strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.63).
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS composite) that correlate positively with PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) and other psychosocial vulnerabilities associated with higher PSS (r for NGSE = -0.66).
- Convergent subjective indicators (anxiety, poor sleep, emotional dysregulation, pain, low efficacy) are numerous and have relatively large sample correlations with PSS, outweighing several protective physiological signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = 1.06) that is positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.32).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), above the clinical cutoff and associated with higher PSS.
- Low self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.43) and modestly lower health satisfaction (Z = -0.62), psychosocial features that tend to co-occur with greater perceived stress.
- Behavioral markers that can reduce resilience (late sleep timing ~01:02 AM, lower interdaily stability Z = -0.57, somewhat shorter median sleep).
- Some objective daytime cardiovascular activation (pronounced midday HR peaks) that could reflect episodic physiological strain.
- However, these risk signals are generally more moderate and have weaker correlations with PSS in the sample than Participant 1’s strongest predictors; several protective factors (low RHR, stable within-day rhythm, strong academic functioning, limited substance use, modestly higher happiness) temper the inferred elevation.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the strength and number of subjective risk indicators differ.
- Participant 1 shows very large subjective elevations on measures that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 and PSQI, plus emotional lability and pain). These are high-magnitude signals that the summary explicitly says outweigh objective protective signals.
- Participant 2 shows some elevated indicators (trait anxiety, PSQI > 5, low self-esteem), but these are more moderate in magnitude, have weaker correlations with PSS in the sample, and coexist with several protective features (low RHR, good academic functioning, fairly preserved circadian amplitude). The study summary explicitly characterizes Participant 2’s PSS as “slightly above” the mean.
- Because Participant 1’s subjective risk indicators are both larger in magnitude and tied to stronger PSS correlations, the balance of evidence indicates a higher level of perceived stress for Participant 1 relative to their cohort—and likely higher overall perceived stress than Participant 2 (who appears only moderately above their cohort mean).

4,67106,31,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong symptom drivers directly linked to PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51) and marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83). Anxiety in this sample correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.75).  
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS and reduce coping capacity.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), implying reduced perceived coping resources.  
- Objective nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive overnight heart-rate deviations (several hourly HR-deviation Zs up to ≈2.8) plus late sleep onset and short sleep duration—physiological evidence consistent with hyperarousal and fragmented sleep that align with higher PSS.  
- Integrated: multiple moderate-to-large Z-scores and strong correlations to PSS produce a coherent above-mean stress signal despite some mitigating features.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep concerns that could push stress upward: PSQI = 6 (classified as disturbed), late median sleep onset (~01:29 AM), and somewhat short median sleep duration (~6 h 46 min, Z ≈ -0.51).  
- Low frequency of physical exercise and minimal socializing—behavioral risk factors for poorer stress management (though their direct correlations with PSS in this sample are small).  
- Moderate sleep-start variability (SD ≈ 88 min), which can degrade restorative sleep and modestly associate with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each description is framed versus its own cohort mean. Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their study mean (population mean PSS = 20.62) based on multiple strong, directly PSS-linked indicators (notably anxiety and nocturnal HR arousal). The effect sizes and correlations cited (e.g., anxiety r ≈ 0.75; several Zs >1.4 and HR-deviation Zs up to ~2.8) are substantial.  
- Participant 2 is explicitly inferred to be below their study mean (population mean PSS = 21.62). Their strongest signals are protective: very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (Z ≈ -1.2), high self-esteem/happiness (Zs up to ~1.6), and very strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24-h autocorr Zs ≈ 1.9–2.07). The sleep and lifestyle risks for Participant 2 are modest in magnitude and described as having smaller correlations with PSS in the cohort.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 presents multiple, convergent, relatively large-magnitude predictors of higher perceived stress (clinical anxiety, high pain interference, low self-efficacy, and marked nocturnal physiological arousal). These are directly and strongly associated with PSS in the sample and collectively point to an above-mean PSS.  
- Participant 2 shows several strong protective features and only modest, lower-magnitude risk signals. Overall evidence points to below-mean PSS for Participant 2.

- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, z = 1.32) — correlated with PSS and large magnitude.
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal (multiple overnight hourly HR deviations above the sample mean; largest z ≈ 1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (~0.22–0.39).
- Low self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) with a strong negative association to PSS (≈ −0.66), consistent with greater perceived stress vulnerability.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24) and increased substance‑use subscale (BASIS‑24 substance z = 1.5) that may contribute to stress susceptibility.
- The study summary explicitly judges this participant’s profile as above the study mean (population mean PSS = 20.67).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score:
- Reduced interdaily stability of cardiac rhythm (z = −1.73) and reduced circadian amplitude (z = −1.01) — physiological markers that in population research associate modestly with higher stress or vulnerability.
- Evening HR elevations (7–10 pm positive deviations) and some small early‑morning HR deviations correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.2) suggesting episodic physiological arousal.
- Moderate alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2×/week, z = 0.94) — a small potential risk factor in context.
- However, the study summary explicitly judges this participant’s profile as below the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.63), and the physiological signals are moderate and smaller in magnitude than the protective psychosocial indicators.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning:
- Each description is relative to its own study population. Participant 1 is characterized as above their population mean and shows multiple, moderately large positive z‑scores and high‑impact psychological signals (notably GAD‑7 and PSQI) that have strong correlations with PSS. The nocturnal HR elevations provide convergent physiological evidence.
- Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean and shows strong, large‑magnitude psychosocial signals in the opposite direction (very low depression and trait anxiety z ≈ −1.3, high happiness z = 1.64, long objective sleep z = 1.53), which strongly favor lower perceived stress. The physiological vulnerabilities (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, evening HR peaks) are present but are smaller in magnitude and have weaker associations with PSS than Participant 1’s key indicators.
- In short, Participant 1 shows multiple convergent, moderately strong signals pointing toward above‑mean perceived stress within their cohort; Participant 2 shows several strong signals pointing toward below‑mean perceived stress within their cohort and only modest physiological vulnerabilities.

Overall judgment:
Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress).

- Physiological/circadian dysregulation consistent with stress: higher resting HR (66.1 bpm, Z ≈ +0.95), very elevated intradaily variability (≈0.78, Z ≈ +1.65), low circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.25) and reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9). These objective markers correlate positively with PSS in this sample.
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:49) and modestly lower current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) that are associated with higher PSS.
- Integrated interpretation in the record: several multimodal indicators push the inference above the population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61), even though the elevation is described as modest rather than extreme.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Very strong self-report risk signals: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z ≈ +2.04; GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS, r ≈ 0.71), very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 18, Z ≈ +1.49; PSQI r ≈ 0.41), high pain/interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28), and marked emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42).
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29), a trait that typically amplifies perceived stress.
- Objective corroboration from wearables: extreme sleep restriction (median ≈ 3 h 42 min) with large night-to-night variability, elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.15), low circadian amplitude and mesor (HR amplitude Z ≈ -0.9; mesor Z ≈ -1.14), and nocturnal HR deviations during 12–4am that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51). These combine to strongly indicate elevated perceived stress.
- The integrated interpretation in the record explicitly concludes the participant is above the population mean PSS (population mean PSS = 20.33), with multiple high-Z indicators outweighing modest protective features.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both participants are interpreted as above their respective study population means. However, the magnitude and number of elevated risk indicators differ:
  - Participant 1: moderate elevations in physiological/circadian markers (some Zs around +1 to +1.65) and moderate trait anxiety (Z ≈ +0.46). Several protective factors (good subjective sleep quality relative to sample, near-mean depression, higher self-esteem, good academic functioning, low substance use) are noted and the record characterizes the PSS elevation as modest.
  - Participant 2: multiple, large-magnitude risk indicators (several Zs ≈ +2 or larger for anxiety, pain, emotional lability; extreme objective sleep restriction), strong correlations of key self-report measures with PSS, and fewer and weaker protective factors. The record characterizes the PSS elevation as more substantial.
- Although the absolute population mean PSS values differ slightly (21.61 for P1’s sample; 20.33 for P2’s), the within-sample z-scores and severity of clinical signals are the relevant frame per the instructions. By that frame, Participant 2 shows more and larger deviations on measures strongly tied to PSS.

Overall weighing of evidence
- Participant 2’s profile contains more severe, higher-Z, and more convergent indicators of perceived stress (severe anxiety, very poor/short sleep, high pain/interference, emotional lability, low self-efficacy, objective sleep/circadian fragmentation) than Participant 1’s profile, which shows only moderate elevations on a subset of physiological/circadian markers and has substantial psychosocial protections.
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Wearable-derived night metrics suggesting severe nocturnal disruption (median sleep 1 h 44 min, z ≈ -1.24; high sleep start-time SD ≈ 160 min), which align with the PSQI and can increase perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 z ≈ 0.71; PAPAS z ≈ 0.8), both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).

- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ 1.52) plus objectively short and highly variable sleep (median 6 h 15 min z ≈ -1.15; duration SD z ≈ 1.52) and frequent napping (z ≈ 2.66), all associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate (70.3 bpm, z ≈ 1.44) and dampened circadian amplitude (z ≈ -0.47), physiological markers that align with greater stress.
- Low socializing and minimal exercise (very negative z-scores), high sedentary hobby time (z ≈ 3.19), and low health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.61) — behavioral correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Convergent pattern across self-report, wearable sleep, and cardiovascular metrics indicating above-mean stress.

Comparative/within-population reasoning
- Directional summaries in each profile: Participant 1 is judged “near the sample mean” with a modest upward contribution from sleep and pain, whereas Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as “above the study sample mean” with multiple strong convergent indicators.
- Magnitude and convergence: Participant 1’s principal risk signals (PSQI z ≈ 0.83; pain z ≈ 0.7–0.8) are moderate and are substantially offset by several robust protective signals (very low GAD-7 z ≈ -1.2, high self-efficacy, low resting HR z ≈ -1.02, strong circadian rhythm metrics). By contrast, Participant 2 shows larger-magnitude elevations on core affective measures (CES-D z ≈ 1.63; STAI z ≈ 1.25), objective wearable signs of chronic sleep restriction/variability, and elevated resting HR (z ≈ 1.44) that collectively form a coherent pattern pointing above the mean.
- Measurement caveats: Participant 1’s extremely short wearable sleep estimate may reflect non-wear or algorithm issues (some uncertainty), reducing confidence that wearable sleep alone implies very high PSS; Participant 2’s objective sleep and physiological signals are more internally consistent with self-report distress, increasing confidence in an above-mean inference.

Overall balance of evidence
- Although Participant 1 has notable stress-relevant problems (sleep disturbance and pain), these are partially offset by strong protective psychological and physiological features, leading to an inference near the study mean (modestly above at most).
- Participant 2 has multiple, relatively large-magnitude risk indicators across affective symptom scales, sleep (subjective + objective), resting heart rate, and low social/physical activity that are convergent and point clearly to above-mean perceived stress.

- The summary explicitly interprets the net profile as above the sample mean PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within its study frame)
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), and in this sample PSQI has a relatively strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Pain/interference measures (PEG-3, PAPAS) at nontrivial levels and interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54); pain and interpersonal problems in this dataset correlate moderately with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ +1.2), which could reflect higher basal arousal (weakly associated with PSS here).

Reasons Participant 2 is likely not highly stressed (protective evidence)
- Strong protective factors: very high self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.41) and NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.63).
- Robust circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability Z = +2.13, high 24-h autocorrelation Z = +1.57, amplitude Z = +1.73, low intradaily variability Z = -1.05), and long objective sleep duration (median ≈ 9 h 41 min, Z = +1.47). Emotional lability is low (Z = -0.67) and substance use minimal (Z = -1.62).
- The summary explicitly interprets the net profile as near or slightly below the sample mean PSS.

Comparative within-sample reasoning
- Both participants show subjective sleep disturbance (P1 PSQI = 9; P2 PSQI = 10.5). However, Participant 1’s sleep problems are accompanied by severe circadian disruption (very late, highly variable sleep timing, very low interdaily stability, blunted amplitude), which in this dataset are consistently associated with higher PSS. Participant 1 also has very high nap frequency (Z ≈ +3.05), a striking deviation linked to the disturbed nocturnal pattern and higher stress.
- Participant 2’s sleep disturbance is paired with strong, consistent protective factors that have large sample-level relationships to PSS (notably NGSE r ≈ -0.63 and very high interdaily stability Z ≈ +2.13). Those protective signals are large in magnitude and were judged in the summary to outweigh the moderate risk factors, producing an overall inference near or slightly below the mean PSS for that study.
- The provided summaries themselves conclude Participant 1 is above their study mean (population mean = 21.6) and Participant 2 is near or slightly below their study mean (population mean = 21.38). The net pattern of risk vs. protection is stronger in the risk direction for Participant 1 than it is for Participant 2.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 presents multiple converging risk indicators (sleep/circadian dysregulation, high nap frequency, trait anxiety, academic stressor) with only modest physiological and behavioral protective signals.
- Participant 2, while showing some risk (subjective sleep problems, pain, interpersonal strain), has powerful protective signals (high self-efficacy and very strong circadian regularity) that the summary interprets as offsetting the risks.
- Therefore, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress relative to their respective study population.

7,67192,15,31,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean)
- Strong internalizing symptom signal: High depressive symptoms (CES‑D z = +1.95) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI z = +1.65). Both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.27–0.31), making them highly PSS‑relevant.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), late median sleep onset (~01:15 AM) with high night‑to‑night variability—patterns that correlate positively with higher PSS.
- Elevated tonic and evening physiological arousal: High MESOR (z ≈ +2.01), elevated resting HR (z ≈ +1.62), and pronounced evening HR deviations—consistent with greater physiological stress load.
- Low health satisfaction and low BMI: Very low self‑rated health (z ≈ −2.03) and low BMI (17.8) add to a distress signal.
- Secondary supportive signals: Low happiness and lower self‑esteem align with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean)
- Very poor subjective and objective sleep: PSQI = 15.5 (z ≈ +0.67) and extremely short median nightly sleep (~4 h 22 min) with large night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +0.89). PSQI has a relatively strong correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Circadian disruption and dampened rhythms: Low interdaily stability, low 24‑h autocorrelation, and reduced cosinor amplitude—features that commonly co‑occur with higher stress.
- Interpersonal strain: High BASIS‑24 Interpersonal score (z ≈ +2.34), indicating social/interpersonal stressors that can elevate perceived stress.
- Evening HR elevations and blunted amplitude: physiological signs of irregular daily structure that often accompany higher stress.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing of evidence
- Both summaries conclude the participant is at or somewhat above their population mean, but the strength and nature of the signals differ.
- Participant 1’s strongest indicators are psychological symptom measures (CES‑D and STAI) that are themselves moderate predictors of PSS in that sample; these are large z‑score deviations and carry direct, documented correlations with PSS. Participant 1 also shows elevated tonic physiological arousal (MESOR/resting HR) reinforcing the stress inference.
- Participant 2 has a very concerning objective sleep deficit (4h+ nightly shortness) and marked sleep/circadian irregularity plus interpersonal strain; these are important PSS correlates, and PSQI has a relatively large sample correlation with PSS. However, Participant 2 simultaneously shows several protective/contradictory signals (very low current anxiety, low pain, near‑average self‑efficacy, and low resting HR/MESOR), and the holistic summary explicitly judged them near the population mean (with only a modest tilt above).
- Overall evidence comparison: Participant 1 shows multiple large, convergent psychological and physiological signals that are directly tied to higher PSS in that study (strong z‑deviations on CES‑D, STAI, MESOR, resting HR, and health satisfaction). Participant 2 has one very severe behavioral sign (extremely short objective sleep) and interpersonal strain but also several countervailing protective indicators and a final assessment near the mean rather than clearly above it.

Conclusion
On balance, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

24,86440,33,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong, convergent self-report indicators that are known strong predictors of PSS:
  - Severe generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = +1.51) — the single strongest available predictor (r = 0.74 with PSS).
  - Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5; Z = +1.65; r = 0.43 with PSS).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = +1.03; r with PSS = 0.63).
  - Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 elevated) and lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; NGSE r = -0.66 with PSS).
- Multiple subjective measures pointing in the same direction (anxiety, poor sleep, affect dysregulation, pain, low perceived coping), and several of those have large correlations with PSS in the sample — these provide strong evidence for above-mean perceived stress.
- The study summary explicitly concludes this participant is likely above the population mean (20.54) because the subjective signal outweighs physiological resilience markers.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some modest indicators that correlate positively with PSS:
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; Z ≈ +0.13), above the clinical cutoff.
  - Slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.10) and substantial sleep-duration variability (~94 min).
  - Relatively late sleep onset (median ≈ 00:50).
  - A few hourly HR deviations whose cohort-level associations with PSS are modestly positive.
- These features could push perceived stress up modestly, but they are small effects in this profile.

Comparative, within-frame reasoning (each description is relative to its own population mean)
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their cohort mean (population mean = 20.54), driven by very large subjective-symptom signals (GAD-7 and PSQI especially) that have strong correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as below their cohort mean (population mean = 21.62). Their potentially stress-elevating features (PSQI = 7, some variability) are small in magnitude and outweighed by lower trait anxiety/depression (STAI and CES-D slightly below mean), high self-esteem, protective behaviors, and favorable physiological markers (low RHR, good circadian autocorrelation).
- Magnitude and predictive strength favor Participant 1: P1’s GAD-7 and PSQI deviations are large (Z ≈ +1.5–1.65) and tied to strong correlations with PSS; P2’s deviations on stress-related predictors are small (Zs typically near 0 or modestly negative for the most predictive variables). Even though the two participants are referenced to slightly different population means, the absolute severity of P1’s symptom signals (especially anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) strongly suggests a higher absolute PSS than the comparatively mild signals indicating elevated stress for P2.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple, large-magnitude subjective risk indicators with strong sample-level correlations to PSS → likely substantially above their population mean.
- Participant 2: generally favorable trait and physiological profile, with only mild sleep/variability concerns → likely below their population mean and overall lower absolute perceived stress than Participant 1.

10,96184,10,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) and can increase perceived stress despite adequate objective sleep duration.
- Modest associations between certain nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning HR Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) and PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31) that could contribute a small amount to perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS:
- Severe objective sleep restriction (median 5 h 27 min, Z = -2.16) and extreme night-to-night variability (sleep-start SD Z = +7.44; sleep-duration SD Z = +5.88), both strongly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Subjective disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7) that aligns with objective deficits.
- Disrupted circadian/rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced amplitude; Zs ≈ -1.5 to -1.8), consistent with poorer stress regulation.
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI ≈ 42; contributes positively to PSS) and early-morning HR deviations modestly correlated with PSS.

Comparative, within-frame reasoning:
- Each summary is relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.5; P2 mean = 21.61). Participant 1’s strongest signals are large protective factors (maximum NGSE, very low GAD-7, low emotional/interpersonal distress, strong circadian stability, very low resting HR) with large correlations to PSS (e.g., NGSE r ≈ -0.60; GAD–PSS r ≈ +0.75). The single notable risk for P1 is subjective sleep disturbance, but objective sleep and multiple strong protective markers point to lower-than-mean PSS.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, large-magnitude risk signals for higher PSS—most notably extreme sleep shortness and irregularity (objectively severe, with very large Z-scores), circadian disruption, and some trait anxiety—despite several protective factors (low depression, high self-esteem, low substance use). The sleep/circadian deviations for P2 are extreme relative to that sample and are primary drivers of the inference that P2 is above their population mean.
- Comparing the balance and effect sizes: Participant 1’s protective signals are both numerous and tied to variables with strong correlations to PSS, making a below-mean classification credible. Participant 2’s primary risk signals (severe objective sleep deficiency and irregularity) are highly deviant and strongly implicated in higher PSS within that dataset. Overall, the weight of evidence indicates Participant 2 has higher perceived stress relative to their population than Participant 1 has relative to theirs.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; z = +0.67; classified ""Disturbed Sleep"") — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Very short median wearable sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 216 min; z = +0.89) and large variability in sleep onset (SD = 204 min; z = +0.34) — disrupted/insufficient and irregular sleep often accompany elevated perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude (z ≈ −1.05 for interdaily stability; amplitude z = −0.84) — weakened circadian organization is commonly linked with higher stress.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = +2.34) — interpersonal difficulties are a contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress (even if this subscale shows only weak correlation with PSS in the sample).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean 21.59)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52; z = +1.06) — one of the strongest positive correlates of PSS in the dataset (r ≈ +0.31); a primary driver toward higher perceived stress.
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17; z = +0.38; classified “Depressed”) — CES-D correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ +0.28).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; z = +1.05) plus objectively late sleep timing (~02:25 AM) and short median sleep (5 h 58 min; z = −1.52) — poor subjective sleep and delayed/short objective sleep pattern support higher stress inference in this profile.
- Circadian fragmentation (elevated intradaily variability z = +0.46; reduced 24-h autocorrelation z = −0.19) — these features are positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Physiological arousal signatures: elevated resting HR and mesor (z ≈ +0.47 and +0.95) and marked evening HR deviations (5–6 pm deviation z ≈ +1.69) — consistent with periods of sustained activation that align with higher PSS signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both descriptions are given relative to their own cohort means, so z-scores and reported correlations matter more than raw instrument values.
- Participant 1 shows a strong signal from very short, highly variable sleep and reduced circadian regularity (factors linked to higher stress), but also has strong protective/contraindicating signals: minimal current anxiety (GAD-7 z = −1.38), low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, and below-mean resting HR/mesor. The description explicitly concludes the participant is near the population mean with only a modest tilt above it.
- Participant 2 shows multiple elevated psychosocial measures that are known and reported in this dataset to correlate with PSS (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms) in addition to disturbed subjective sleep, circadian fragmentation, short/late sleep, and physiological arousal indicators. Although Participant 2 has several protective lifestyle factors (frequent exercise, good self-rated health, social trust), the narrative and the cited sample-level correlations indicate a clearer overall pattern pointing above the cohort mean.

Weighing evidence
- The predictors in Participant 2 that are both elevated and have known moderate correlations with PSS (notably trait anxiety and depressive symptoms) provide a stronger, more coherent signal for above-mean perceived stress than the mixed signal for Participant 1.
- Participant 1’s very poor and irregular sleep is a notable risk signal, but it is counterbalanced by several strong protective indicators (very low anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, lower resting HR), and the overall synthesis placed Participant 1 near the mean with only modest tilt above it.
- Participant 2’s profile is explicitly interpreted as above the mean and includes multiple converging domains (affective symptoms + sleep disturbance + circadian and physiological signatures) that more strongly predict elevated PSS in that sample.

Conclusion
Based on the within-sample comparisons and the balance of evidence, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

2,24883,38,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Disturbed sleep timing and quality: very late habitual sleep onset (~3:00 AM) and PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), both known correlates of higher PSS in the sample.
- Nocturnal/late-evening physiological arousal: large positive HR deviations around midnight–early AM (hourly Zs up to ~2.8) and reduced circadian amplitude/interdaily stability (amplitude Z = -1.11; interdaily stability Z = -0.99), patterns linked in the cohort to higher PSS.
- Behavioral risk factors: low frequency of exercise (Z = -0.43), low socializing (Z = -1.41), and lower health satisfaction (Z = -0.70) that can increase stress exposure or reduce buffering.
- Slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.07), and STAI correlates with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), supporting some contribution to perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not have a higher PSS / reasons against very high PSS
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = -0.45) and strong academic functioning (GPAs ~3.9–4.0), suggesting preserved functioning and coping.
- High self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.52) and low resting HR (Z = -0.71), which are protective and associated with lower PSS.
- Some circadian measures (24-h autocorrelation near mean, lower intradaily variability Z = -1.31) may reflect less fragmented daily physiology.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very strong self-report risk signals: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z = 2.04; GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS, r ≈ 0.71), extremely poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = 1.49, PSQI r ≈ 0.41), high pain/interference (PEG-3/PAPAS Z = 2.28), high emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 2.42), and very low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -2.29). These are large, consistent, and highly PSS-relevant effects.
- Objective sleep/circadian disruption consistent with stress: median nightly sleep extremely short (3 h 42 m) with high night-to-night variability, low interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability (Zs indicating fragmentation), and dampened HR rhythm (amplitude Z ≈ -0.9; mesor Z ≈ -1.14).
- Hourly HR deviations in early night (1–4am) that show moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), consistent with nocturnal arousal linked to higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have a higher PSS / reasons against a uni-dimensionally severe profile
- Some protective signs: minimal substance-use problems (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = -1.62), relatively preserved interpersonal functioning (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Z = -1.07), and low resting HR (≈55 bpm, Z ≈ -0.93). These can buffer functioning but do not negate the many strong risk signals.

Comparative reasoning within each sample frame
- Magnitude and consistency: Participant 2 shows multiple very large Z-scores on measures that strongly correlate with PSS in their sample (GAD-7 Z = 2.04 with r ≈ 0.71; emotional lability and pain Zs > 2), plus extreme objective sleep restriction. Participant 1 shows a mix of moderate risk indicators (late sleep timing, nocturnal HR elevations, reduced amplitude/interdaily stability) but also several protective, moderate-to-strong mitigating signals (high self-esteem, low CES-D, low resting HR, strong academics).
- Relative strength of associations with PSS in each sample: the variables that are most predictive of PSS in Participant 2’s description (notably anxiety and PSQI) have larger sample correlations and are markedly abnormal for that participant. Participant 1’s abnormal features are less extreme and some of the strongest sample predictors (depression, trait anxiety) are not elevated for them.
- Directional clarity: Participant 2’s indicators coherently point toward elevated perceived stress (self-report + objective sleep disruption + circadian fragmentation), whereas Participant 1’s indicators are mixed and the summary explicitly places them “near the population mean, leaning slightly toward above-average.”

Overall balance of evidence and conclusion
- Participant 2 displays a stronger, more consistent, and higher-magnitude set of risk indicators for elevated perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 1 does relative to theirs. Even accounting for the fact that each description is referenced to its own population mean, Participant 2’s profile is more clearly and severely shifted in the direction of high PSS.

- Very severe and objectively confirmed sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), median wearable sleep ≈ 3 h/night, and extreme night-to-night sleep-timing variability (SD start time Z = 2.82). Sleep measures here have substantial positive correlations with PSS in the sample (PSQI r = 0.50), making this a strong stress-related signal.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 (mild anxiety) and elevated BASIS-24 Emotional Lability (Z = 0.43); GAD-7 and emotional-lability measures show strong positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: Substance Abuse subscale high (Z = 1.75) and pain measures correlate positively with PSS, consistent with greater perceived stress.
- Circadian/rhythm disruption: Reduced interdaily stability, lower amplitude, and lower 24-h autocorrelation (Zs negative) — these rhythm metrics modestly correlate with PSS and reinforce the sleep/stress signal.
- Net effect: Several of the strongest PSS-correlated measures point toward higher stress; protective factors (very high self-efficacy, low resting HR) are present but are described as insufficient to offset the main signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Objective circadian/physiological markers indicative of disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These features have modest associations with higher PSS in the sample.
- Shorter and somewhat variable sleep: median ≈ 6 h 7 min (Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated sleep-duration variability (Z ≈ +0.94), both weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Behavioral markers possibly linked to stress: high sedentary/leisure time (TV Z ≈ +2.54) and unusual early-morning HR deviations (large positive Zs at 5–7 AM) — these could reflect stress-related patterns or other behaviors (e.g., early exercise), but their link to PSS is uncertain/weaker.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS score (important counterpoints)
- Strong, directly stress-related self-report indicators are favorable: low trait anxiety (STAI-T = 28, Z = -1.31), low-to-moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D near mean), high happiness and health satisfaction (Zs +1.64 and +1.96), and high self-esteem (Z = +1.10). These self-report measures have clearer negative/weak correlations with PSS and are weighted heavily in the summary.
- Low substance use, regular exercise, and good subjective sleep quality on PSQI (score ≈ 5) further support below-mean perceived stress.

Comparative weighing of evidence (within each study’s frame)
- Participant 1: multiple high-weight, strongly PSS-correlated signals (severe objective and subjective sleep disruption, high correlation GAD-7 and emotional-lability scores, substance problems) point consistently above that study’s mean PSS (21.33). Effect sizes and correlations cited for these measures are large.
- Participant 2: strongest signals are protective self-reports (low trait anxiety, high happiness/health satisfaction) that point below its study mean (21.59). Objective circadian/sleep perturbations are present but are smaller in magnitude and have weaker correlations with PSS in that sample.
- In short: Participant 1’s profile contains more and larger indicators that are tightly linked to perceived stress in that study, whereas Participant 2’s primary stress-related signals are weaker and are offset by robust subjective well-being scores.

Decision
Given the stronger, convergent, and higher-weighted stress indicators for Participant 1 (especially extreme sleep disturbance plus strongly PSS-correlated anxiety/emotional-lability measures) versus Participant 2’s predominantly low-stress self-report profile with only modest objective disruptions, Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15.5 (Z ≈ +0.67) and classified “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI correlates with PSS in this sample (r = 0.53).
- Pain and functional impairment: PAPAS = 81 (Z ≈ +0.93), also strongly positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy: NGSE Z = -0.62; NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.69), so this is consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated nocturnal heart rate and higher mesor/RHR (mesor Z ≈ +0.7; RHR Z ≈ +0.61; night HR deviations Zs up to ≈ +1.38) — physiological markers that in this sample associate with higher PSS.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83), indicating irregular daily timing, which modestly associates with higher PSS in this dataset.

Reasons tempering that inference for Participant 1
- Lower-than-average GAD-7 (mild anxiety; Z ≈ -0.76), and anxiety correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.76), so this lowers the expected PSS.
- Protective/neutral behavioral signals: relatively long median nightly sleep (Z ≈ +0.92), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -1.28), and slightly lower emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.37).
- Overall, most stress-related signals for P1 are moderate (many Zs ~0.6–0.9), suggesting a moderately above-mean PSS rather than extreme elevation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES-D Z ≈ +1.42 (depressed) and STAI–Trait Z ≈ +0.66 (anxious); these self-reports are directly relevant to perceived stress.
- Low self-rated happiness (Z ≈ -1.61), consistent with elevated subjective distress.
- Sleep disturbance and irregularity: PSQI Z ≈ +0.59, very late median sleep timing (~01:19), large night-to-night variability (sleep SD ≈ 113 min), and high mean daily naps (Z ≈ +2.27).
- Strong circadian dysregulation: markedly reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -1.48) and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.40), both larger deviations than seen for Participant 1.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (8–9pm deviation Z ≈ +1.85), indicating elevated physiological arousal in the evenings.
- Behavioral indicators (reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use) align with higher stress.

Reasons tempering that inference for Participant 2
- Some protective/functional indicators: normal resting heart rate (Z ≈ 0.01), healthy BMI, good academic performance, modest substance use, and some social time — these suggest preserved functioning despite symptom burden.
- Some wearable–PSS correlations in the sample are modest, so physiological/circadian signals should be interpreted with caution.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means for PSS. The question is which participant’s profile implies a larger elevation relative to their sample mean.
- Participant 1’s strongest deviations are moderate (PSQI and PAPAS Zs ≈ +0.7–0.93; some HR night deviations up to ≈ +1.38). There are several protective/neutral signals (notably lower GAD-7).
- Participant 2 shows a larger set of more extreme deviations: CES-D Z ≈ +1.42, happiness Z ≈ -1.61, naps Z ≈ +2.27, circadian amplitude Z ≈ -1.48, interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.40, evening HR deviation Z ≈ +1.85. Multiple features show larger-magnitude Z-s than Participant 1’s most deviant measures.
- Although some P2–PSS correlations are modest, the breadth and size of P2’s elevations in depressive symptoms, circadian dysregulation, sleep variability, and evening physiological arousal create a stronger overall signal of above-mean perceived stress than the moderate but mixed profile for P1.

3,45076,13,29,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1's study population)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47).
- Moderate pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS) above population median; pain measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which can reduce perceived social support.
- Mildly elevated physiological arousal (mesor and resting HR Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), which could reflect stress-linked autonomic activation even though correlations with PSS are weak.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5), which is positively related to PSS (though here it is below common clinical thresholds).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2's study population)
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) and mild depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 15, Z = 0.18); both positively correlate with PSS in this sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, above clinical cutpoint) plus late and variable sleep timing (median ~00:57, SD ≈ 63 min), which can worsen perceived restorative sleep and relate to PSS.
- Reduced circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = -0.74) and mildly increased intradaily variability (Z = 0.32) — weaker day-to-day structure is associated with higher stress in this dataset.
- Early-morning heart-rate deviations that, in this sample, show small positive correlations with PSS (suggesting nocturnal/early-morning arousal/worry may elevate perceived stress).
- Lower recent happiness and health satisfaction (small negative signals that co-occur with higher stress).

Comparative weighting within each study’s frame and final judgment
- Participant 1 has some clear risk signals (very poor PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain) that point toward higher perceived stress. However, several strong protective features are present and carry substantial weight in this sample: high general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.41) which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63), pronounced circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability Z = 2.13, low intradaily variability), low emotional lability (Z = -0.67; emotional lability correlates strongly with PSS), and very low substance problems. The integrated interpretation provided for Participant 1 concluded PSS near or slightly below their population mean.
- Participant 2 shows multiple small-to-moderate risk signals (trait anxiety, mild depressive symptoms, PSQI > clinical cutpoint, circadian irregularity, early‑morning arousal) and fewer or weaker buffering circadian/behavioral protections. Although Participant 2 also has important protective features (high self‑esteem Z = 1.38, frequent exercise, low resting HR), the profile was interpreted as near the population mean with a modest tilt toward being slightly above it.

Because both profiles were judged “near the mean” for their respective populations but the provided syntheses explicitly lean in opposite directions (Participant 1: near/slightly below mean; Participant 2: near/slightly above mean), and because Participant 1’s strong protective factors (especially NGSE and exceptional circadian regularity) are both large in magnitude and tied to strong correlations with PSS in that sample, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

21,87328,30,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) — the clearest self-report marker in P1 that aligns with higher perceived stress.
- Late median sleep onset (01:26 AM) and modestly elevated nap rate (Z = 1.21), which in the study weakly correlate with higher PSS.
- Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (peak around 6–7 PM; Z ≈ 2.62) that could reflect sustained arousal and have modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z = -1.20), a weak correlate that could contribute to higher perceived stress in some contexts.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any):
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12) — a very strong predictor here (correlation with PSS ≈ 0.77).
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, Z = 1.32) — substantial and positively correlated with PSS.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (midnight–3am deviations Z ≈ 0.7–1.0) that correlate positively with PSS and indicate poor autonomic recovery overnight.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.25) with a strong negative correlation with PSS (≈ -0.66), and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24) which correlates strongly with PSS (≈ 0.68).
- Elevated substance-abuse subscale (Z = 1.5) indicating additional psychosocial risk (less directly correlated with PSS but relevant).

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame:
- Each summary is already judged relative to its own population mean: P1 is described as most consistent with being below its population mean PSS (population mean = 21.63); P2 is described as most consistent with being above its population mean PSS (population mean = 20.67).
- The signals favoring lower stress in P1 are strong and numerous (very low depressive symptoms CES‑D Z = -1.38; very low trait anxiety STAI Z = -1.81; high circadian amplitude Z = 1.78; low resting HR), and the stress-aligned signals for P1 (PSQI = 7, late timing, evening HR) are weaker/modest correlates in the sample.
- P2 shows multiple moderate-to-strong stress-aligned signals, notably GAD‑7 (high correlation with PSS) and very elevated PSQI with substantial z-score, plus nocturnal autonomic evidence and reduced coping/self-efficacy. Protective signals for P2 (adequate sleep duration, lower resting HR) are present but are characterized as weaker/tempering rather than dominant.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 2 exhibits several high-impact, convergent indicators that are well-correlated with PSS in that study (especially anxiety and marked subjective sleep disturbance), and is explicitly inferred to be above their study mean.
- Participant 1 exhibits mostly protective/low-stress indicators and is explicitly inferred to be below their study mean; the stress-relevant signals are fewer and weaker in magnitude/correlation.
- Therefore, across their respective study-relative frames, Participant 2 very likely has the higher perceived stress.

4,74413,31,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51). Anxiety in this sample has one of the strongest correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.75), making this a major driver of elevated perceived stress.  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) and objective nocturnal arousal (large positive hourly HR deviations overnight; several hours with positive correlations to PSS). Sleep disruption + night-time hyperarousal link strongly to higher PSS.  
- High pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS high; Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) which correlate positively with PSS and reduce coping capacity.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), indicating reduced coping resources.  
- Multiple indicators have sizable effect sizes (large Zs and high sample correlations), producing a coherent high-stress signal despite some protective features.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower or buffered PSS (countervailing, for context)
- Above-average circadian amplitude and interdaily stability and low intradaily fragmentation—these wearable-derived regularity metrics are modestly protective and suggest behavioral regularity that could mitigate stress, but effect sizes are smaller than the symptom signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.76; Z ≈ 1.51) and reduced interdaily stability—these circadian/within-day fragmentation metrics are positively associated with PSS and suggest more day-to-day instability.  
- Large evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., 10–11 pm +22 bpm, Z ≈ 2.46) and other afternoon/evening HR peaks that may reflect elevated evening arousal/rumination; some hourly deviations modestly correlate with PSS.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.2), both of which modestly associate with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (stronger evidence)
- Low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D = 6, STAI-T = 31; both well below mean), which correlate positively with PSS and therefore are strong protective signals.  
- Elevated self-esteem, regular exercise, minimal substance use—behavioral and psychosocial buffers linked to lower stress.  
- Adequate and consistent objective sleep duration (median ~7 h 34 m, low night-to-night variability) and relatively low resting HR—both modestly associated with lower PSS.  
- Overall integrated assessment in the profile places Participant 2 near or slightly below their study mean (mean PSS = 21.62).

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Participant 1’s profile shows multiple large, convergent, and highly PSS-related signals (severe anxiety with a very strong sample correlation to PSS, major sleep disturbance, high pain interference, and low self-efficacy) and corroborating nocturnal physiological arousal. These features are explicitly interpreted in that profile as producing perceived stress above the sample mean (mean = 20.62). Protective circadian regularity metrics are present but smaller in magnitude and correlation than the symptom signals.  
- Participant 2 shows a mixed picture but the strongest, most directly PSS-linked signals (depression/anxiety trait scores) are low, and several robust protective factors (self-esteem, exercise, consistent adequate sleep, low resting HR) outweigh the circadian fragmentation and evening-arousal signals. That profile concludes near-to-slightly-below their sample mean (mean = 21.62).

Conclusion
- On balance, Participant 1 exhibits a stronger, larger-magnitude, and more directly PSS-linked set of indicators of elevated perceived stress than Participant 2. Therefore Participant 1 likely has the higher PSS.

9,25197,12,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 50, Z = 0.86). In this dataset STAI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), making this a meaningful stress signal.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and objectively shortened sleep (median ~6 h 34 min, Z = -0.77), both commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness (Current Happy Z = -0.53) and late habitual sleep timing (sleep start ≈ 01:45), which are modestly linked to higher PSS in the sample.
- The integrated interpretation in the description explicitly states the profile “leans toward a modestly elevated level of perceived stress relative to the study sample,” likely at or slightly above the mean (within ~1 SD).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ -1.13) and very short objective sleep (median ~3 h 27 min, Z = -0.66). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r = 0.46).
- High intradaily variability (Z = 2.29; r with PSS = 0.24) and elevated nap frequency (Z = 1.24), indicating fragmented rest–activity patterns associated with higher PSS.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 relationships Z = 0.94), though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s profile is mixed but the summary explicitly concludes they are near-to-slightly-above their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68). The strongest stress-related signals are moderate (STAI r ≈ 0.31; sleep disturbance).
- Participant 2 has very severe sleep-related risk factors (much shorter objective sleep than P1), which are important, but the strongest predictors in this study (GAD-7 and NGSE) strongly indicate lower stress for Participant 2: GAD-7 is low (Z = -0.94) and GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.76); NGSE is relatively high (Z = 0.49) and strongly inversely correlated with PSS (r = -0.65). The written synthesis therefore concludes Participant 2 likely falls below their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.42, SD = 7.28).
- In sum, although Participant 2’s sleep is worse than Participant 1’s, the magnitude and direction of the strongest sample-level predictors favor lower perceived stress for Participant 2 (strong negative indicators: low GAD-7 and high NGSE). Participant 1’s moderately elevated anxiety and sleep disturbance, combined with the written interpretation that they are “near-to-slightly-above” their sample mean, point to higher PSS overall relative to Participant 2 (whose profile is judged below their sample mean).

Weighing evidence and conclusion
- Participant 1: overall interpretation = near-to-slightly-above their population mean PSS.
- Participant 2: overall interpretation = below their population mean PSS, despite severe sleep problems, because the strongest correlates (low GAD-7, high NGSE, low emotional lability) point toward lower PSS.
- Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

22,17569,10,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), a known correlate of higher PSS in the cohort.
- Objectively short sleep duration (median 5 h 44 m; Z = -1.81) which is a substantial deviation and commonly elevates perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily heart-rate variability (Z ≈ 0.46) and reduced current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), both aligned with higher PSS (though correlations are modest).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Very elevated subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83) and wearable-indicated extremely short median sleep (1 h 44 m; Z = -1.24). PSQI is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), making this a substantive upward driver.
- Elevated pain/interference measures (PEG-3 Z ≈ 0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ 0.8), which are moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal HR deviations suggestive of night-time arousal that align with sleep disruption and have modest positive correlations with PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean. Participant 1’s description explicitly concludes a tilt modestly toward lower perceived stress than their population mean (21.61), because multiple protective signals (low trait anxiety/depression, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, strong interdaily stability and amplitude, low resting HR) outweigh the sleep risks. Several of those protective metrics have negative correlations with PSS in that cohort and have moderate Z-scores in Participant 1.
- Participant 2’s description explicitly concludes stress near the population mean (21.5) but likely modestly above it, driven primarily by strong predictors of higher PSS in that cohort: high PSQI and elevated pain/interference. Although Participant 2 also shows strong protective indicators (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, robust circadian metrics), the write-up emphasizes that PSQI and pain are moderate-to-strong correlates of PSS and produce an upward shift.
- Weighting correlations and Z-scores: Participant 2’s elevated PSQI and pain measures are described as having stronger sample correlations with PSS than many of Participant 1’s risk indicators. Participant 1’s protective profile is more numerous and pronounced relative to their cohort (multiple positive Zs and circadian robustness), whereas Participant 2’s protections offset but do not fully negate the strong sleep/pain signals that push PSS upward.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit a higher inferred PSS relative to their study population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs. Participant 1’s net profile is described as near-to-slightly-below their population mean, while Participant 2’s net profile is described as near-to-slightly-above their population mean, with the upward drivers for Participant 2 (PSQI, pain) being among the stronger correlates of PSS in that cohort.

9,69057,12,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study sample)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.46), so this is a substantive stress-related signal.
- Very short objective sleep duration: wearable median nightly sleep = 3 h 27 min (Z ≈ −0.66) and high night-to-night variability (SD = 197 min, Z ≈ +0.62). Short/fragmented sleep is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- High intradaily variability (rest–activity fragmentation): value = 0.64 (Z ≈ +2.29); intradaily variability has a positive association with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.24), supporting a link to elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal = 13, Z ≈ +0.94), which could reflect psychosocial stressors (though its sample-level correlation with PSS is small and in the description is not a clear positive predictor).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study sample)
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 53 (Z ≈ +1.16). Trait anxiety correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), making this an important predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Short objective sleep and subjectively disturbed sleep: median wearable sleep = 5 h 35 min (Z ≈ −1.99) and PSQI = 7 (“disturbed”); both short objective sleep and poor subjective sleep quality are linked with higher PSS.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation: lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.74) and elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.39); intradaily variability has a positive association with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16).
- Late/delayed timing and elevated evening physiological activation: median sleep start ≈ 02:08, pronounced evening HR peak (5–6 PM +22.8, Z ≈ +1.79) — habitual late timing and evening arousal can contribute to difficulty offloading stress and relate to higher PSS.
- Contextual psychosocial stressor: declining academic performance (GPA drop from 3.1 to 2.28), plus lower self-rated health satisfaction and reduced happiness/self-esteem — contextual factors that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame and weighing of evidence
- Strength and direction of strongest predictors:
  - Participant 1: The strongest sample-level predictors present are actually protective — very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 4; strong sample correlation r ≈ +0.76 with PSS means low GAD-7 strongly predicts lower PSS) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE high; r ≈ −0.65 with PSS). Emotional lability is very low (Z ≈ −1.67), also protective. These strong, highly correlated predictors point toward P1 being below their sample mean despite serious sleep problems.
  - Participant 2: Trait anxiety is elevated and is a meaningful predictor of higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Sleep/circadian measures are also substantially shifted toward higher-risk values (objective sleep much shorter relative to that sample, late timing, evening HR peak). Multiple converging risk factors (anxiety + sleep/circadian + academic decline + lower well‑being) point toward P2 being above their sample mean.
- Relative magnitude of sleep dysfunction:
  - Participant 1 shows extremely short median sleep (3 h 27 min), but many other strong psychological predictors point away from high PSS for P1.
  - Participant 2 shows pronounced but less extreme short sleep relative to their sample (5 h 35 min, Z ≈ −1.99) and multiple additional converging psychosocial risk indicators.
- Protective factors:
  - P1’s protective markers (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) are tightly linked to PSS in the sample and carry strong weight toward lower perceived stress.
  - P2 has notable protective factors (very low resting HR/mesor suggesting fitness, frequent exercise, low substance use, socializing, low depressive symptoms) that temper the risk signal but do not fully negate the converging anxiety + sleep + contextual stress signals.

Overall determination
- Although Participant 1 has a very severe objective sleep deficit and elevated fragmentation, the strongest sample-level predictors available (very low GAD-7, high NGSE, very low emotional lability) point toward lower perceived stress relative to their sample mean.
- Participant 2 presents multiple converging and moderately strong indicators of elevated perceived stress relative to their sample (elevated trait anxiety, objectively and subjectively short/disturbed sleep, circadian irregularity, late timing, academic decline, lower wellbeing), and while they have protective features (fitness/exercise), the net balance in their profile was judged in the source summary to be above the study mean.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (above common cutoff), late median sleep onset (~02:19 AM).
- Nocturnal autonomic activation: wearable HR shows pronounced positive deviation around midnight–1 AM (mean dev ~9.8 bpm; Z ≈ +1.66) and elevated HR at 1–2 AM (Z ≈ +1.18).
- Weaker circadian organization: lower amplitude (Z ≈ -0.57) and slightly reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.16), which in this dataset are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Lower health satisfaction and slightly lower current happiness (Z ≈ -0.70 and Z ≈ -0.53), modestly concordant with higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean):
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”), despite adequate objective sleep duration.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning negative deviations with Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).
- The sleep-quality discrepancy (good objective duration vs. poor subjective quality) which can be associated with distress.

Comparative weighting within each study frame
- Strength and direction of signals: Participant 2’s countervailing indicators of higher stress (PSQI and some nocturnal HR features) are relatively isolated and have smaller predictive weight in these datasets compared with their very strong protective indicators (NGSE Z +1.79 with r = -0.60; very low GAD-7 Z -1.38 with r = +0.75; large positive circadian Zs; very low RHR Z -2.23). These large-effect signals point strongly to below-mean PSS for Participant 2.
- Participant 1 does have protective signals (very low CES-D Z ≈ -1.28 and STAI Z ≈ -1.02, high self-esteem Z ≈ +1.10) that favor below-mean PSS, but these measures have smaller correlations with PSS in this dataset than Participant 2’s strongest predictors. Participant 1’s nocturnal activation and sleep disturbance are more pronounced (notably the midnight HR elevation Z ≈ +1.66) and, although some correlations are modest, these factors provide comparatively stronger stress-related evidence than the isolated sleep complaints in Participant 2.
- Overall, Participant 2’s profile shows larger-magnitude, highly predictive markers of low perceived stress (especially self-efficacy and extremely low RHR and strong circadian metrics). Participant 1’s profile is more mixed: while trait mood/anxiety measures are low, the nocturnal physiological activation and poorer subjective sleep are more salient and comparatively increase inferred PSS relative to Participant 2.

Conclusion
- Both participants are inferred to be below their respective population means, but Participant 1 presents the stronger set of indicators pointing toward elevated perceived stress (relative to their cohort) than Participant 2. Therefore Participant 1 likely has the higher PSS of the two.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) in this sample.
- Moderate pain/interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) that are above the sample median and correlate with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which can reduce perceived social support.
- Elevated basal cardiac measures (mesor and resting HR Z ≈ 1.16–1.22) that could reflect increased autonomic arousal (though correlations with PSS are weak).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44), and trait anxiety shows a positive correlation with PSS in this dataset.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) above clinical cutoff; PSQI links to higher PSS.
- Substantially reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.56) and large sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ 1.48) — behavioral irregularity commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness and modestly reduced self-esteem, both aligning with higher stress.
- Evening/nighttime HR deviations and a modestly elevated MESOR (Z ≈ 0.46), consistent with some elevated physiological tone.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Key sample-level correlations: PSS is strongly associated with anxiety measures (e.g., GAD-7/STAI) and inversely with general self-efficacy (NGSE). Participant 1: low-to-mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5) and strong protective NGSE (Z = 1.41) — two large-weight factors pushing toward lower PSS relative to that sample mean. Participant 2: modestly elevated trait anxiety and no countervailing high NGSE reported; this pushes toward higher PSS relative to their sample mean.
- Circadian/behavioral regularity differs sharply: Participant 1 shows very strong interdaily stability and low intradaily variability (large protective signal vs their sample). Participant 2 shows markedly low interdaily stability and high sleep-timing variability (risk signal vs their sample). These circadian signals favor lower PSS for Participant 1 and higher PSS for Participant 2.
- Although Participant 1’s subjective sleep complaints are worse than Participant 2’s (PSQI 10.5 vs 8), Participant 1’s robust protective profile (high NGSE, strong regularity, low emotional lability, low substance use) is described as outweighing those risks in their sample. Participant 2’s pattern combines several moderate risk factors (anxiety, irregularity, poorer momentary mood) with fewer strong protective offsets (sports and adequate sleep duration help, but do not fully negate the risk signals).

Overall balance and decision
- The synthesized profiles and the original integrated judgments in each description point in the same direction: Participant 1 is inferred near or slightly below their population mean PSS; Participant 2 is inferred above their population mean PSS. Taking the relative strengths of risk vs protective factors and the reported sample-level correlations into account, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = +0.83) — PSQI correlates moderately-strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver. Wearable median sleep (~1 h 44 min, Z = -1.24) supports objective nocturnal disruption (though noted as possibly biased).
- Pain and interference: PEG-3 average (Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS (Z ≈ +0.80) are elevated and correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), pushing inferred stress up.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal: night-hour heart-rate deviations have small–moderate positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.42), giving additional (though weak-to-moderate) support for elevated stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evident signals)
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI trait Z ≈ +0.76 and CES-D Z ≈ +0.28, both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Disturbed subjective sleep and reduced duration: PSQI = 6 (classified disturbed) and median sleep ~6 h 41 min (Z ≈ -0.61), with night-to-night variability — all associated with higher PSS.
- Markedly elevated baseline physiology: resting heart rate and MESOR Z ≈ +2.38 (large elevations), indicating substantially higher baseline physiological activation that is associated with greater perceived stress.
- Supporting behavioral contributors: infrequent exercise and some alcohol use that do not buffer stress; these, combined with psychophysiological signals, strengthen an above-mean inference.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1 is characterized relative to their population as near the mean PSS, with specific upward contributors (sleep disturbance and pain) but several strong protective factors (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability, robust circadian metrics, low resting HR). Some risk signals are moderate (PSQI, pain), but strong inverse predictors (GAD-7 r = 0.75; NGSE r ≈ -0.68) argue against a large PSS elevation.
- Participant 2 is characterized relative to their population as above the mean PSS, supported by multiple converging risk signals across domains (affective trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep) and a notably large physiological signal (resting HR/MESOR Z ≈ +2.38). While P2 has some protective circadian regularity and high self-esteem, these mitigating factors are smaller in magnitude compared with the physiological and affective elevations.
- In magnitude terms, P2’s physiological elevation (Z ≈ +2.38) is substantially larger than any single risk indicator for P1; P1’s strongest risks (PSQI Z ≈ +0.83, pain Z ≈ +0.7) are moderate and are counterbalanced by strong protective indicators (GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.2, low RHR Z ≈ -1.02, high HR amplitude Z ≈ +1.38). P2’s risk signals are more consistently elevated across modalities and include a large baseline autonomic load.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows more and stronger converging indicators of above-mean perceived stress (notably the large resting HR/MESOR elevation plus elevated trait anxiety and disturbed sleep).
- Participant 1 shows some important stress-related problems (sleep, pain) but also several strong protective factors that keep the inferred PSS near the cohort mean, with at most a modest uplift.

- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9.0 with a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated and strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.68). These are high-weight indicators in this dataset.  
- Substance-related difficulties and some pain interference (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = +1.75; pain scales correlate positively with PSS), which plausibly increase perceived stress.  
- Circadian/rhythm instability (low interdaily stability Z = −1.42; low amplitude Z = −1.10; low autocorrelation Z = −0.68), consistent with higher PSS.  
- These indicators are framed relative to the study mean (population mean 21.33, SD = 7.38) and include measures with large sample correlations to PSS, strengthening the inference that this participant lies above their population mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective sample means.  
- Participant 1’s above-mean signals are numerous but generally moderate in magnitude (z-scores around ±1) and are tied to predictors that have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28, PSQI correlation not stated as extremely large). Some strong protective factors (high interpersonal trust Z = +1.79, frequent exercise Z ≈ +1.07) also appear.  
- Participant 2’s profile includes multiple, more extreme indicators (very short median sleep, huge sleep timing variability Z = +2.82, substance-abuse Z = +1.75) and several measures that have large sample correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.78; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68; PSQI r = 0.50). Although Participant 2 also has a strong protective factor (very high general self-efficacy, NGSE Z = +1.79, r = −0.63), the most PSS-predictive measures in this profile are large and in the direction of greater stress.

  - High pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS, Z ≈ +1.4–1.6), which have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).
  - Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61).
- Physiological evidence consistent with stress:
  - Pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations (e.g., 12–1 AM deviation Z ≈ +2.83; other night windows Z ≈ +2.1) and late sleep onset/short sleep (~01:42 start, ~4 h 55 m duration) support night-time hyperarousal linked to higher PSS.
- Net effect within-sample framing:
  - Multiple large-effect (high |Z|) measures and high correlations with PSS point toward a PSS substantially above this study’s mean (20.62).
- Mitigating features (not outweighing above):
  - Relatively preserved circadian amplitude and interdaily stability (Z ≈ +0.58 to +0.91) and low intradaily fragmentation (Z ≈ -0.52) are protective but have smaller correlations with PSS (r values modest) and so likely only partially offset the strong symptom signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Small/ambiguous physiological or behavioral signals that could relate to higher PSS:
  - Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ +1.02 and +1.22) and pronounced evening HR peaks (8–9 pm deviation Z ≈ +2.09). Resting HR has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14).
  - Late median sleep start (~02:25 AM), which could reflect chronotype or evening demands and can sometimes be associated with stress-related schedule strain.
- Why these are weak as predictors (within-sample framing):
  - These physiological/behavioral signals have small correlations with PSS in the dataset and are plausibly attributable to lifestyle (late-night activity, social/academic engagement) rather than chronic perceived stress.
  - Self-report and affective indicators (CES-D, STAI, PSQI, happiness, self-esteem, health satisfaction) are strongly and consistently protective (large negative Zs for depression/anxiety and positive Zs for well-being), all of which align with lower-than-mean PSS in this participant’s population (mean 21.62).
  - Overall pattern: many large protective signals vs. only modest physiological elevations.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weight of evidence
- Both descriptions are relative to their own study means (P1 mean = 20.62; P2 mean = 21.62). Participant 1 is characterized as above their mean with multiple high-effect predictors (severe anxiety, severe subjective sleep disturbance, high pain, low self-efficacy) and pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal. The predictors for P1 have large Zs and/or are highly correlated with PSS (notably anxiety r ≈ 0.75).
- Participant 2 is characterized as below their mean with strong, multi-domain protective signals (very low depression/anxiety, good sleep, high happiness/self-esteem, strong circadian regularity, social exercise). The candidate risk signals for P2 (elevated resting HR/mesor, evening HR peaks, late sleep timing) are smaller in effect, have weaker correlations with PSS, and are plausibly lifestyle-related rather than indicating chronic perceived stress.
- Given the magnitude and number of P1’s stress-relevant indicators (especially clinical-level anxiety and corroborating nocturnal physiology) versus the primarily protective and lower-magnitude risk features for P2, the balance of evidence favors Participant 1 having the higher absolute perceived stress.

2,95490,38,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 1’s sample frame)
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 21; Z ≈ +2.04) — a strong, highly weighted predictor of higher perceived stress in this sample (r ≈ 0.71 with PSS).
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18; Z ≈ +1.49) and objectively extremely short median sleep (≈3 h 42 min) with large night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min) — both strongly linked to higher PSS.
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 10; PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28) — pain correlates with higher perceived stress.
- Marked emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42) and low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29) — psychosocial traits that amplify perceived stress relative to peers.
- Wearable circadian disruption: low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, dampened HR rhythm (amplitude/mesor low) — patterns consistent with stress-related physiological dysregulation.
- Nighttime heart-rate elevations at sleep onset (e.g., +6.6 bpm at 12–1am) with moderate positive correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), supporting elevated nocturnal arousal linked to higher stress.
- Although there are some protective signals (low substance-use problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, relatively low resting HR), they are fewer and lower-magnitude than the multiple large risk signals above, so the net evidence points to PSS above that study’s mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.56, “anxious”) and modest depressive symptoms (CES-D nonclinical but positive association) — both push PSS upward, though at smaller effect sizes than Participant 1’s anxiety.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, clinically flagged) plus late and somewhat variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:11; sleep-start SD ≈ 101 min, Z ≈ +0.4) — modest contributors to higher PSS.
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ −1.48 is a notable negative; intradaily variability mildly elevated) and slightly higher resting HR (Z ≈ +0.39) — physiological signs associated with greater perceived stress in this cohort.
- Lower happiness and somewhat lower self-esteem (small-to-moderate negative Zs) also align with higher PSS.
- Offsetting evidence: several protective/neutral factors of moderate size — regular exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), good academic functioning (GPA mid–high 3.0s), higher socializing (Z ≈ +0.95), absence of recreational drug use, and no severe depressive scores — all of which reduce the likelihood of very high PSS. Overall the signals for higher PSS are present but of modest magnitude and partly counterbalanced.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and overall judgment
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the strength and magnitude of the signals differ markedly.
- Participant 1 shows multiple large-magnitude risk indicators (several Zs ≈ |2| or greater: severe anxiety, pain/interference, emotional lability, very low self-efficacy) plus extreme objective sleep restriction and physiological nocturnal arousal. Those indicators are strongly and consistently associated with higher PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 shows multiple modest-to-moderate indicators pushing PSS up (trait anxiety mildly elevated, disturbed sleep, circadian irregularity), but most effect sizes/Z-scores are small-to-moderate and many protective factors offset them.
- The small difference in population mean PSS values (20.33 vs 21.61) is negligible compared with the much larger magnitude and number of risk signals present for Participant 1.
Conclusion: Participant 1 is likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse perceived stress).

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 24; Z = 1.11) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76). Both measures have positive correlations with PSS in this sample and are explicitly cited as the strongest signals pushing PSS above the mean.
- Elevated resting heart rate (68.6 bpm; Z = 1.24) and pronounced daytime heart‑rate elevations that are compatible with sustained sympathetic arousal; RHR has a (smaller) positive correlation with PSS.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and markedly late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:02 AM) with reduced circadian amplitude — both can be associated with greater stress and affective symptoms.
- The authors’ holistic judgment: overall profile summarized as “above the population mean,” though modestly so.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (as described relative to their population mean)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18; Z = 1.51) and GAD‑7 is reported to have a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this cohort (r = 0.74) — the single strongest predictor cited.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5; Z = 1.65), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63), elevated pain/functional interference, and lower self‑efficacy — several subjective domains with substantial correlations to PSS converge on higher perceived stress.
- The authors’ holistic judgment: despite organized physiology, the strong self‑report signal leads to the conclusion that this participant is above their cohort mean PSS.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective study means. The question is which shows a larger/stronger deviation from typical for their sample.
- Strength of subjective predictors: Participant 2’s elevated measures include GAD‑7 and PSQI with larger Zs and much stronger correlations to PSS (notably r = 0.74 for GAD‑7 and r = 0.63 for emotional lability) than Participant 1’s strongest predictors (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31). This makes Participant 2’s subjective signal both larger in magnitude and more predictive of PSS within their cohort.
- Z‑score magnitudes: Participant 2’s key Zs (GAD‑7 Z ≈ 1.51; PSQI Z ≈ 1.65) are larger than Participant 1’s mood/anxiety Zs (CES‑D Z = 1.11; STAI Z = 0.76). Larger standardized deviations on measures that strongly predict PSS point toward a greater above‑mean PSS for Participant 2.
- Objective physiology: Participant 1 shows some objective arousal (higher RHR Z = 1.24) but also strong protective physiology/behavior (high interdaily stability Z = 1.24, frequent exercise Z > 1, long stable sleep). Participant 2’s physiology is largely protective (low RHR, good interdaily stability, consolidated rhythms). Thus physiology tilts slightly toward higher PSS for Participant 1 but toward lower PSS for Participant 2.
- Net balance: For Participant 1, subjective risk signals are moderate and partially offset by multiple behavioral/physiological protections, yielding a modest above‑mean PSS. For Participant 2, subjective risk signals are both larger in magnitude and linked to stronger PSS correlations; objective protections are present but described as insufficient to outweigh the subjective signal. Therefore the evidence overall points to a larger perceived‑stress elevation for Participant 2 relative to their cohort mean.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5), which correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r = 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep duration (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) and high variability in sleep timing (sleep-start SD ≈ 123 min), both commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (+11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation moderately correlated with PSS (r = 0.46), suggesting nocturnal arousal that could raise perceived stress.
- Sleep-specific disturbances could drive higher PSS even if daytime measures are low.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Trait anxiety is moderately elevated (STAI Z = +0.66) and STAI shows a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.34), supporting higher perceived stress.
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45), a large deviation that commonly coincides with greater stress (even if its correlation with PSS is small).
- Short objective nocturnal sleep (median ≈ 5 h 50 min, Z = −1.68) and elevated sleep variability, both associated with increased stress and daytime dysfunction.
- Behavioral/lifestyle risk markers: minimal exercise (Z ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), low happiness (Z ≈ −0.53), and limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), which together create a context likely to elevate perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning:
- Participant 1’s strongest signals that would lower inferred PSS are trait measures with large sample correlations to PSS (notably very low GAD-7; r = 0.77) and relatively robust daytime physiological/circadian protection (low RHR, high interdaily stability). These high-weight protective signals outweigh the sleep-related risk signals (which have only moderate correlations with PSS).
- Participant 2’s risk signals are multi-domain (elevated trait anxiety, extremely low health satisfaction, short/variable sleep, low exercise/social engagement) and, while some correlations are modest, they accumulate across psychological, subjective health, sleep, and behavioral domains. Protective signals for Participant 2 exist but are generally weaker or more domain-limited (e.g., low depressive symptoms, good subjective sleep quality despite short objective sleep).
- Net: Participant 1 is inferred below their population mean; Participant 2 is inferred modestly above their population mean. The balance of evidence therefore indicates Participant 2 has the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study samples.

- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 10). In this dataset GAD-7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.77), making even a moderate GAD-7 score a salient predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.49), and this extreme PSQI deviation is consistent with higher stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ +0.93), which has a strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.67).
- Lower general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.62), and NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r = −0.66), indicating vulnerability to higher stress appraisal.
- Some somatic burden (pain interference) and behavioral/physiological signs of higher arousal (e.g., resting HR and MESOR elevated, sleep timing late, large night‑to‑night sleep variability) that are congruent with stress in several metrics (resting HR z ≈ +1.31, sleep variability z ≈ +1.12).
- Several of the above predictors are among the strongest sample-level correlates of PSS, so the self-report pattern is highly suggestive of being above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their sample frame)
- Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI z ≈ +0.66) and STAI correlates moderately with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.34), which supports some increased perceived stress.
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (z ≈ −2.45), a large deviation even though its correlation with PSS is small; such a marked negative health appraisal commonly accompanies greater stress.
- Short objective sleep duration (median ≈ 5 h 50 min, z ≈ −1.68) and somewhat increased sleep variability (z ≈ +0.51), both of which often link to higher stress and daytime dysfunction.
- Behavioral risks: minimal exercise (z ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), reduced socializing and lower reported happiness — contextually consistent with elevated perceived stress.
- However, many of these signals either have only modest correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.34) or are partially offset by protective indicators (good subjective sleep quality PSQI = 4, low depressive symptoms, low resting HR and stable circadian metrics, no substance use).

Comparative weighting and interpretation (within-study-frame)
- Both participants are inferred in their descriptions to be above their respective study means. The key comparison is strength, coherence, and predictive value of their indicators relative to their own sample.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators map onto variables that have large sample-level correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.67; NGSE r = −0.66; PSQI r = 0.49). Multiple reasonably large z‑score deviations on these high‑weight predictors create a coherent signal pointing to higher perceived stress.
- Participant 2 has several meaningful deviations (notably very low health satisfaction and short objective sleep) and elevated trait anxiety, but many of these either have weaker sample correlations with PSS (e.g., health satisfaction r ≈ −0.12) or are counterbalanced by several protective signs (good subjective sleep quality, low resting HR/MESOR, stable circadian metrics, low depressive symptoms). The net signal for Participant 2 is more mixed and described as only modestly above the sample mean.
- Overall, Participant 1 presents a stronger, more consistent set of high-weight (high-correlation) predictors of PSS, whereas Participant 2’s risk indicators are either lower-weight predictors or are offset by stronger protective physiology/self-report.

2,35011,38,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score:
- Strong physiologic/circadian dysregulation: very high resting HR (Z = +2.31), marked reduction in circadian amplitude (Z = -2.10) and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.98), plus elevated intradaily variability (Z = +1.37). These objective signals are plausibly linked to stress-related autonomic/circadian disruption.
- Sleep problems: short median sleep (≈6 h, Z = -1.37), very late sleep onset (~02:34), and PSQI >5 (disturbed sleep) — factors known to increase perceived stress.
- Behavioral vulnerability and mood: low exercise and socializing, low self‑rated physical health (Z ≈ -1.78), slightly elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ +0.7).
- Some substance use pattern (alcohol frequency slightly above average) that can co-occur with higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score:
- Very strong self-report signals that are highly correlated with PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 Z = +2.04; GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71 with PSS), very poor sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ +1.49; PSQI r ≈ 0.41), and low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -2.29).
- Multiple very large Z-scores in psychosocial domains: emotional lability Z ≈ +2.42, pain/pain interference Z ≈ +2.28 — all symptomatic of high perceived stress.
- Extreme objective sleep restriction and instability: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min with large night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min), plus circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.15). Wearable heart-rate deviations at night suggest nocturnal arousal linked to insomnia/anxiety (some hour bins r ≈ 0.48–0.51 with PSS).
- These self-report markers (especially severe anxiety and low self-efficacy) are strong, direct predictors of PSS in this sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective population means. However, the nature and strength of indicators differ. Participant 1’s strongest signals are physiological and circadian (high resting HR, blunted amplitude, unstable daily rhythm) with moderate links to PSS; self-report affective measures include some protective features (lower trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem, above-average happiness) that mitigate the overall signal.
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple very large self-report Z-scores on measures that have strong correlations with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 and low self-efficacy), plus severe objective sleep restriction and corroborating wearable evidence of nocturnal arousal and fragmentation. The high-Z, high-correlation self-report indicators (anxiety, self-efficacy, emotional lability, pain, PSQI) provide a stronger, more direct basis for an elevated PSS estimate than Participant 1’s primarily physiologic signals.

Balance of evidence and conclusion:
- Although Participant 1 shows pronounced physiologic/circadian dysregulation (some Zs ≳ |2|), Participant 2 shows more numerous and larger-magnitude psychosocial/self-report indicators that have stronger empirical associations with PSS in that study (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71), together with extreme objective sleep loss. These factors create a more compelling case that Participant 2’s perceived stress is higher relative to their population mean and, in comparison, worse overall.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; classified “Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.46), so this is a stress-related signal.
- Very short wearable-derived sleep duration (median ≈ 3 h 27 min) and high night-to-night variability (sleep SD = 197 min) — severe objective sleep restriction and instability can increase perceived stress.
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity (value = 0.64, Z = +2.29); in this sample IV is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ +0.24), consistent with greater fragmentation and higher stress risk.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain subscale (BASIS-24 interpersonal = 13; Z ≈ +0.94), which could contribute psychosocial stress (though its correlation with PSS here is small).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52; Z ≈ +1.06) and trait anxiety is a strong positive correlate of PSS in this dataset (r ≈ +0.31).
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17; Z ≈ +0.38) and CES-D correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ +0.28).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05), a known correlate of higher PSS.
- Objectively short and delayed sleep (median ≈ 5 h 58 min, very late sleep onset ~02:25 AM; sleep-duration Z ≈ −1.52) — combined with disturbed PSQI this aligns with higher perceived stress in this profile.
- Circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.46; lower 24-h autocorrelation) and elevated evening heart-rate deviations (e.g., 5–6 pm Z ≈ +1.69), which in this sample are associated with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each participant’s description is explicitly written relative to their own study population mean. Participant 1’s integrated assessment concluded the balance of evidence “leans toward lower perceived stress” than their sample mean (21.42, SD 7.28), largely because very strong inverse predictors of PSS (notably very low GAD-7; r with PSS ≈ +0.76, and high NGSE; r with PSS ≈ −0.65) point strongly toward reduced perceived stress despite severe sleep problems.
- Participant 2’s integrated assessment concluded perceived stress “above the study population mean” (mean 21.59, SD 3.65), with several converging indicators (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed PSQI, circadian fragmentation, short/late sleep, and physiological arousal) that are positively associated with higher PSS in that sample. Protective behaviors (exercise, social trust, good self-rated physical health) were present but judged insufficient to outweigh the stress-related signals.
- The relative strengths of predictors favor Participant 1 being below their cohort mean: their strongest predictors (GAD-7, NGSE, emotional lability) have large sample-level correlations with PSS and point toward lower stress. In contrast, Participant 2 has multiple moderate predictors all pushing toward higher stress (trait anxiety, CES-D, PSQI, circadian and physiological markers).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed profile but key high-weight predictors indicate lower-than-average perceived stress for their cohort, with sleep a notable countervailing risk.
- Participant 2: multiple convergent indicators of higher stress relative to their cohort, including elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms plus disturbed sleep and circadian/physiological corroboration.

- Strong anxiety- and affect-related signals: GAD-7 = 9 with a very high correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale; r = 0.68). These are powerful positive predictors of higher perceived stress.
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: substance-abuse subscale Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS—additional risk contributors.
- Circadian instability: reduced interdaily stability and amplitude (Zs ≈ -1.4, -1.1) consistent with stress-linked rhythm disruption.
- Moderators: strong protective factors are present (very high self-efficacy NGSE Z = 1.79, low resting HR/mesor Zs ≈ -0.55 to -0.66), but the strongest, most PSS-correlated indicators (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, circadian disruption, substance problems) converge toward higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- High depressive and anxiety symptom burden: CES-D = 33 (Z = 2.05) and STAI = 47 (Z = 0.56). Both scale scores are positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.27–0.31).
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15 (Z = 3.83)—a large deviation that commonly co-occurs with elevated perceived stress.
- Physiological corroboration of arousal/fragmentation: mildly elevated resting HR (Z = 0.65), higher intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.81), daytime HR deviations—these are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Moderators: several notable protective/offsetting features—objectively long and consistent sleep (median 8 h 10 min, Z = 1.22; low night-to-night variability Z = -0.92), regular exercise (Z = 1.07), social time (Z = 0.95), very low substance use, and engagement in music (Z = 2.06). These behaviors plausibly buffer perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and number of PSS-linked indicators: Participant 1 has multiple indicators that (a) are strongly correlated with PSS in their sample (notably GAD-7 r = 0.78; emotional lability r = 0.68; PSQI r = 0.50) and (b) are extreme in magnitude (objectively ~3 h sleep nightly, very high sleep-timing variability). Those features carry substantial predictive weight for higher PSS within that study’s frame.
- Participant 2 shows a very large subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 3.83) and marked depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 2.05), but the psychiatric measures reported for this cohort have smaller correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.27–0.31). Moreover, Participant 2 has several robust behavioral/physiological protective factors (long consistent objective sleep, exercise, social time, low substance use) that likely temper the PSS elevation.
- In short, Participant 1’s risk signals are both stronger in their association with PSS (higher r values reported) and include an objectively extreme physiological stressor (severely curtailed sleep), whereas Participant 2’s strongest deviations include subjective distress and depression but are accompanied by clearer protective behaviors and weaker PSS correlations.

Judgment weighing the evidence
- Given the convergence of multiple, strongly PSS-correlated risk markers in Participant 1 (very short/irregular sleep, high anxiety correlation, emotional lability, substance problems, circadian instability), and despite notable protective self-efficacy, Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress score relative to their population mean than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5). In this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), so this is a substantive risk factor relative to the population mean.
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS values above the population median) — these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47) and can elevate perceived stress.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = +1.54), which can reduce perceived social support and contribute to stress in this individual.
- Mildly elevated physiological arousal (mesor and resting HR Z ≈ +1.16 and +1.22), which, although weakly correlated with PSS, may indicate higher basal autonomic activation in this person.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Objective wearable markers showing reduced circadian robustness (interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.9; amplitude Z ≈ -1.52; intradaily variability slightly elevated). These objective rhythm disruptions have modest associations with higher PSS in the sample.
- Shorter and more variable sleep (median ~6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33; sleep duration variability Z ≈ +0.94), which are linked to higher stress (small positive correlations with PSS).
- High sedentary/leisure media use (TV Z ≈ +2.54), weakly associated with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (large positive Zs at 5–7 AM). While interpretation is uncertain (behavioral vs. artifact), atypical physiology could be stress-related in some contexts.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and balance of evidence
- Participant 1: the strongest stress-related risks are measurable subjective sleep disturbance and pain/interference, plus interpersonal strain and modest physiological elevation. However, Participant 1 also has powerful protective factors relative to their population: high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.41; NGSE correlates strongly with PSS, r ≈ -0.63), pronounced circadian/behavioral regularity (large interdaily stability and low intradaily variability), low emotional lability, and very low substance problems. The integrated interpretation in the description judged Participant 1’s overall PSS to be near the population mean, likely at or slightly below it, because the strong protective factors were seen as outweighing the risk factors.
- Participant 2: objective wearable features point modestly toward higher stress, but the most predictive self-report measures for PSS in that sample (low trait anxiety STAI Z ≈ -1.31, elevated happiness and health satisfaction Zs ≈ +1.64 and +1.96, good PSQI) are consistently favorable and, per the summary, weigh more heavily in predicting lower PSS. The integrated interpretation judged Participant 2’s PSS likely below the population mean.

Weighing the two profiles
- The risk factors in Participant 1 (clinically poor PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain) are relatively strong and directly tied to PSS in that sample. Although Participant 1 has major protective resources, the presence of clinically meaningful sleep disturbance and pain-related interference places them closer to the mean (or slightly above the lowest-stress participants) in their sample.
- Participant 2’s objective circadian/sleep deficits are notable but have smaller correlations with PSS in the sample, and Participant 2’s low trait anxiety and high well-being/health satisfaction are robust protective signals that the summary explicitly weights more heavily. Thus Participant 2 is judged to be below their population mean by the study authors.

Conclusion
- Relative to their respective study populations, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (i.e., closer to or slightly above their population mean than Participant 2 is relative to theirs).

- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45), a large deviation from the sample mean that commonly co-occurs with greater stress (though its correlation with PSS in this dataset is small, r ≈ −0.12).  
- Short and variable objective sleep (median <6 h, Z = −1.68; sleep SD Z ≈ +0.51), patterns often linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Low exercise (Zs ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), and lower happiness (Z ≈ −0.53) — behavioral features that typically accompany higher stress.  
- The summary inference explicitly places this participant modestly above the study mean PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Clinically relevant anxiety (GAD-7 = 10.5) with a very strong correlation to PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77), making this a highly predictive indicator of elevated PSS.  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale Z ≈ +0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8.5; r ≈ 0.55 with PSS) and substantial night-to-night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ +0.65), both associated with higher PSS.  
- Elevated pain/interference measures (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z = +1.21), which correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Nocturnal/evening HR elevations (hourly HR Zs ≈ +1.25–+1.36 around midnight) that are positively correlated with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40) and reflect physiological arousal linked to stress.  
- The summary inference explicitly places this participant above the study mean PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 2 has multiple elevated measures that are strongly correlated with PSS in their sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77, emotional lability r ≈ 0.65, PSQI r ≈ 0.55), plus corroborating nocturnal physiological arousal. These are direct, high-weight signals for higher PSS.  
- Participant 1 shows some meaningful elevations (STAI Z +0.66; short sleep; very low health satisfaction), but some of the largest deviations (health satisfaction Z −2.45) have only weak correlation with PSS in that dataset, and several strong buffering signals are present (good subjective sleep quality, low depressive symptoms, stable circadian metrics, low resting HR, no substance use).  
- Both participants have protective features, but Participant 2’s elevated indices are concentrated on measures with larger empirical associations to PSS in that study, making the inference of above-mean perceived stress more robust for Participant 2 than for Participant 1.

- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.07), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z = −0.87), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74). In the sample these features modestly correlate with higher PSS.
- Attenuated diurnal HR amplitude (Z = −1.03) and some early‑morning relative HR elevations (morning peak Z = 3.07) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23). These could reflect transient morning arousal tied to stressors (schedule demands).
- Overall, these physiological/circadian signals are the main evidence pointing toward higher perceived stress for this participant, but their effect sizes are described as small-to-moderate and are counterbalanced by many protective indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Marked subjective and objective sleep disturbance: very high PSQI (16.5, Z = 1.0; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.47), extremely short median nightly sleep (2 h 38 m, Z = −0.94), very late and highly variable sleep timing (median start 03:12 AM; SD onset Z = 1.3). These sleep features strongly favor higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart‑rate deviations (+13.54 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = 1.17; +9.79 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = 1.59) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) that is highly predictive of PSS in this sample (GAD‑7–PSS r ≈ 0.78); reaching screening threshold for clinically relevant anxiety meaningfully increases likelihood of above‑mean PSS.
- Pain‑related interference that also positively correlates with PSS (PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).
- Circadian irregularity and shifted rhythms consistent with stress (interdaily stability and autocorrelation low; intradaily variability elevated).
- Protective traits (higher self‑efficacy, low emotional lability) exist, but the strongest, highly correlated stress drivers (anxiety + severe sleep disturbance + nocturnal arousal) dominate the inference.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighting of evidence
- Each description is explicitly interpreted relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is characterized as likely below her study mean (21.65) mainly because multiple robust self‑report and behavioral protective factors (low STAI and CES‑D, high happiness/health satisfaction, good sleep duration/quality, frequent exercise, low substance use) outweigh modest circadian irregularities. The circadian signals supporting higher PSS are small-to-moderate in effect and not decisive.
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely above his study mean (20.75) because several strong, convergent signals that have substantial correlations with PSS co-occur: clinically relevant anxiety (largest predictor), severe subjective and objective sleep disruption, and nocturnal physiological arousal. These signals are both stronger in magnitude and more directly correlated with PSS in the sample than the circadian irregularities seen in Participant 1.
- Effect sizes matter: Participant 2’s anxiety–PSS correlation is large in the sample (r ≈ 0.78), and their sleep and nocturnal HR abnormalities have moderate correlations with PSS. Participant 1’s strongest stress‑related indicators are circadian metrics with smaller correlations (generally modest), while their self‑reports show strong protective deviations from the mean.

Overall determination
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (above their study mean), whereas Participant 1 is more consistent with below‑mean perceived stress in their study.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 48; Z = +0.66). STAI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.34), so this supports above‑mean stress.
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45). Large deviation from sample mean, and although its correlation with PSS is small (r ≈ −0.12), the magnitude of the deficit commonly accompanies greater perceived stress.
- Short and variable objective sleep (median ≈ 5 h 50 min; Z = −1.68; SD sleep variability Z ≈ +0.51). Short sleep is frequently associated with higher stress.
- Low exercise and limited social engagement (exercise Z ≈ −1.6 to −1.9; social Z ≈ −0.62) and low happiness (Z ≈ −0.53) — behavioral context that tends to amplify stress.
- Summary: multiple risk signals of moderate size (anxiety, markedly low health satisfaction, short sleep, low activity/social) support a modestly above‑mean PSS relative to this study’s population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6) where GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78). This is a highly influential predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) and PSQI’s moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49) — strong self‑reported sleep burden.
- Pain interference (PEG ≈ 6.78; PAPAS z ≈ 0.24) with moderate correlations to PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48), adding stress burden.
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 273 min; z = 1.7), low interdaily stability (z = −0.68), and low autocorrelation at 24 h — objective patterns commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.54).
- Summary: several high‑weight predictors (notably GAD‑7 and PSQI) plus objective circadian disruption argue for above‑mean PSS in this population.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s profile includes at least two measures that are strongly correlated with PSS in that dataset (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78 and PSQI r ≈ 0.49) and large objective sleep variability (z = 1.7). Participant 1’s strongest single predictor is STAI (r ≈ 0.34), and other risk indicators (short sleep, low health satisfaction, low exercise) have smaller or moderate associations with PSS in that sample.
- Number and coherence of risk signals: Participant 2 shows coherent risk across self‑reported anxiety, poor subjective sleep, pain interference, and objective circadian irregularity — multiple moderately-to-strongly weighted signals pointing the same direction. Participant 1 shows mixed signals: several moderate risk indicators but also multiple protective buffers (good subjective sleep quality, low depressive symptoms, stable circadian wearable metrics, low resting HR, no substance use).
- Magnitude relative to population means: Both participants are inferred by their summaries to be modestly above their respective study means. However, the predictive weight of Participant 2’s elevated measures (especially GAD‑7) is substantially greater in that study’s predictor structure than Participant 1’s signals are in theirs.
- Net judgement: Given the much stronger predictor effect sizes in Participant 2’s profile and the concentration of higher‑weight risk indicators (anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, objective circadian/sleep irregularity), Participant 2 is more likely to be higher above their study mean PSS than Participant 1 is above theirs.

15,97596,15,32,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean 21.59):
- Marked depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33, Z = 2.05), a robust individual-level indicator of internal distress that in the sample is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.27).
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83), a large deviation from the sample mean that commonly co-occurs with and amplifies perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.56) and low current happiness (Z = -1.61), both aligning with higher perceived stress profiles.
- Physiological signs of greater arousal/fragmentation: mildly elevated resting heart rate (RHR Z = 0.65) and higher intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.81), which modestly associate with higher PSS in the sample.
- The integrated summary explicitly interprets the multimodal pattern as most consistent with above-mean perceived stress (“moderately elevated rather than marginal”).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean 21.29):
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5, Z = 0.67) and notably worse pain/functional interference (PAPAS Z = 0.93); both variables are strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), and NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS in the sample (r = -0.69), implying this below-average score predicts higher perceived stress.
- Elevated circadian/physiologic markers associated with stress: higher mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and pronounced nocturnal heart-rate deviations (Zs up to ≈1.38), which in this dataset correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (IS Z = -0.83), a marker of less regular daily timing that modestly associates with higher PSS.
- The integrated summary also interprets the multimodal pattern as above the sample mean (likely moderately elevated).

Comparative evaluation (within-population framing):
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective study means. Each profile combines subjective complaints and physiological markers that align with higher PSS.
- Magnitude of deviations: Participant 1 shows two very large deviations from their sample (PSQI Z = 3.83; CES-D Z = 2.05), indicating substantial subjective sleep problems and clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Participant 2’s deviations are more numerous but generally moderate in size (most Zs ≲ 1).
- Strength of sample-level associations: Some of Participant 2’s predictors (PAPAS, NGSE) have relatively larger sample correlations with PSS, increasing the weight of moderate deviations. Participant 1’s strongest measures (CES-D, PSQI) were either given smaller sample correlations in the text or not quantified there, but their absolute Z-scores—especially PSQI Z = 3.83—are large and likely meaningful.
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has several behavioral protective signals (long, stable objective sleep, exercise, social time) that temper but do not negate the very large subjective distress signals. Participant 2 has important mitigating features (low GAD-7 relative to sample with a strong anxiety–PSS link, long median sleep, low IV), which may more strongly offset some risk signals.

Balance of evidence and decision:
- Because Participant 1 presents extremely large subjective sleep disturbance and clinically elevated depressive symptoms (large Z-scores), plus corroborating physiological arousal, the absolute severity of those deviations argues for a higher level of perceived stress relative to their sample mean than Participant 2’s pattern.
- Although Participant 2 has multiple moderately elevated indicators that are strongly correlated with PSS (pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR), several protective/muting features (notably low GAD-7) reduce the likelihood that their PSS exceeds Participant 1’s.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) in this sample, so subjective sleep complaints could raise perceived stress for this person.  
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations: Several early-morning HR values show larger negative deviations from mesor and these specific nocturnal values have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), providing a modest physiological signal linked to higher PSS.  
- The sleep-quality vs. objective-duration discrepancy (good actigraphic duration but poor subjective quality) is often associated with distress and could contribute to greater perceived stress than objective metrics alone suggest.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D = 24 (Z ≈ +1.11, “Depressed”); CES-D correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), a strong predictor of higher perceived stress in this sample.  
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 50 (Z ≈ +0.86); STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), another strong predictor of higher PSS.  
- Disturbed, late, and highly variable sleep: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), median sleep start ≈ 01:44, high night-to-night variability (SD Z ≈ +1.32); these sleep/circadian problems align with higher PSS.  
- Reduced circadian regularity: Lower interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, and low 24-h autocorrelation (Zs negative) indicate weaker rhythms that are associated with elevated stress and poorer mood.  
- Contextual psychosocial risk: Low reported social trust (Z ≈ -1.74) and lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95) can increase vulnerability to perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Each description is explicitly framed against its own study population mean (P1: population mean PSS = 21.5; P2: population mean PSS = 21.6). Participant 1’s strongest signals (very high self-efficacy, minimal anxiety, low emotional/interpersonal distress, robust circadian metrics, very low resting HR) are all strongly and negatively associated with PSS in that sample and were judged to place them below their population mean. The only notable upward signal for P1 was subjective sleep disturbance, which is a single moderate predictor relative to the many strong protective indicators.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple convergent signals that, in that study sample, predict higher PSS: clinically meaningful elevations in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both moderately correlated with PSS), disturbed and irregular/late sleep, and reduced circadian robustness. Although P2 has some protective features (high self-esteem, exercise, low RHR), the magnitude and number of mood- and sleep-related risk indicators were assessed as outweighing the protections and placed this participant above their population mean.

Balance of evidence and determination:
- Participant 1: most evidence points to lower-than-mean perceived stress (below 21.5), with only modest countervailing signals (PSQI, some nocturnal HR associations).  
- Participant 2: multiple moderate-to-strong indicators point to higher-than-mean perceived stress (above 21.6), including clinically elevated depression and anxiety and clear circadian/sleep disruption.  
- Therefore, Participant 2 is much more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (a higher PSS score) than Participant 1 when each is evaluated relative to their own study population.

- Elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (z ≈ 0.95), which correlates modestly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17) and may reflect within-day physiological fragmentation.
- Pronounced hourly heart-rate deviations at midday and late evening (some z-scores 2.1–3.1) suggesting episodic physiological arousal that could elevate momentary stress.
- Lower positive momentary affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), and lower positive affect correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ -0.20).

- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ 1.03) with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.63).
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS composite), which correlate positively with PSS and can independently raise perceived stress.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.44) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ -0.66), implying reduced coping resources.
- Convergence of multiple strong subjective predictors pointing to above-mean PSS; objective physiology is partly protective but described as insufficient to outweigh the subjective signal.

Comparative reasoning within the within-population frames
- Each summary is relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is described as likely below their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.64); Participant 2 is described as likely above their population mean PSS (population mean = 20.54).
- The strength and number of subjective predictors for Participant 2 are larger and more strongly correlated with PSS (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.74, emotional lability r ≈ 0.63, PSQI r ≈ 0.43) than the stress-linked signals for Participant 1 (which are modest: intradaily variability r ≈ 0.17, affect r ≈ -0.20, PSQI only modestly elevated).
- Participant 1’s protective indicators (very low CES-D and STAI-Trait z-scores, high self-esteem, long consistent sleep, low resting HR, good interdaily stability) are many and strong in the summary; Participant 2 has some physiological resilience (organized circadian metrics, lower RHR) but these are explicitly described as not outweighing the strong subjective measures driving higher PSS.
- Taken together, the evidence for elevated perceived stress is much stronger and more internally consistent for Participant 2 than for Participant 1 (whose higher-stress signals are weaker, episodic, and counterbalanced by several robust protective markers).

- Nocturnal physiological arousal (substantial positive HR deviations during usual sleep hours; nocturnal HR deviations with positive correlations to PSS).
- Convergent pattern: severe anxiety + sleep/circadian disruption + physiological nocturnal arousal, and the summary explicitly infers PSS above the sample mean.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Direction and strength: Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective study means, but the magnitude and consistency of indicators differ. Participant 1’s elevation is described as modest and mixed: some risk signals (trait anxiety, poor sleep duration, very low health satisfaction) are present but are counterbalanced by protective signals (low depressive symptoms, good subjective sleep quality, stable circadian metrics, low resting HR, no substance use). Overall the summary characterizes Participant 1 as modestly above the mean.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, strong, convergent indicators that are highly predictive of PSS in this dataset (severe GAD-7, low self-efficacy, high emotional lability, elevated pain interference) together with objective corroboration (extremely late/short sleep, high intradaily variability, nocturnal HR elevations). These indicators are both strong in magnitude (many z ≈ +1.1 to +1.3 or −1.4 to −1.55) and consistent across self-report and physiology. The summary frames Participant 2 as clearly above the population mean, with more severe dysfunction and stronger correlates of PSS than Participant 1.
- Relative severity: Participant 1’s strongest single deviation is health satisfaction (z = −2.45), but otherwise many signals are moderate and some are protective. Participant 2’s pattern is multi-domain and consistently elevated in measures that have higher correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78), and wearable physiology corroborates nocturnal hyperarousal. Even accounting for different population SDs, Participant 2’s profile is more severe and more convergent toward high perceived stress than Participant 1’s modest/mixed profile.

Conclusion
Given the greater magnitude, convergence across modalities, and stronger PSS‑predictive measures in Participant 2, Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Pronounced interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z = 2.34), a contextual risk factor for ongoing stress.
- Circadian disruption indicators (low interdaily stability, low autocorrelation at 24 h, blunted cosinor amplitude) that often accompany higher stress and irregular schedules.
- The integrative summary judges the participant as around the population mean with a modest tilt toward above-mean stress.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Both summaries frame findings relative to their own study means. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above the mean ""likely moderately elevated"" relative to a population mean PSS = 21.59 (SD = 3.64). Participant 2 is characterized as near the mean with only a ""modest tilt toward being above the mean"" relative to population mean PSS = 21.29 (SD = 7.42).
- Strength and directness of risk indicators differ: Participant 1 has large affective symptom elevations (notably CES-D Z = 2.05 and PSQI Z = 3.83) that are directly and positively associated with PSS in the sample. Participant 2’s strongest risks are sleep quantity/variability and interpersonal strain; while these are important, several robust protective signs are present (very low self-reported anxiety, low pain, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR).
- Magnitude of deviations: Participant 1’s PSQI and depressive symptom z-scores are larger and more directly linked to PSS than Participant 2’s PSQI z (0.67). Although Participant 2 has extreme short objective sleep and variability (which are meaningful), objective sleep measures in these descriptions tend to have weaker direct correlations with PSS than the affective symptom signals seen in Participant 1.
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has some protective behaviors (regular exercise, social time, long/consistent objective sleep) but the summary concludes they do not fully offset the strong affective and subjective-sleep risk signals. Participant 2’s protective signals (very low anxiety, low pain, decent self-efficacy, lower resting HR) are more salient and weigh down the overall inferred stress level closer to the mean.

Overall judgment
- Balancing the intensity and direct PSS-relevance of risk markers across the two cases, Participant 1’s profile is more consistent with a higher PSS relative to their study population than Participant 2’s profile is relative to theirs.

- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 17.5 (z = 1.32) with a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight hourly heart-rate deviations above the sample mean (e.g., +12 bpm around midnight, z ≈ 1.0) with positive correlations with PSS (~0.22–0.39).
- Lower self-efficacy and emotional lability: NGSE z ≈ -0.25 and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability correlate with PSS (high for emotional lability), consistent with greater perceived stress vulnerability.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- High sedentary/screen-time behaviors: extremely large z-scores for video games (z ≈ 4.74), TV/videos (z ≈ 3.17), internet use (z ≈ 2.19). These are behavioral risk factors that can erode coping resources.
- Low social-trust score (z ≈ -2.39), which could reflect lower perceived social support and potentially increase perceived stress.
- Later sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:04 AM) and very low exercise frequency — behavioral patterns that can contribute to stress or reduce resilience.
- Elevated tonic cardiovascular indicators: heart-rate mesor z ≈ 1.35, amplitude z ≈ 1.72, resting HR z ≈ 0.51 — modestly positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Note: the dataset notes these are countervailing/risk signals but smaller in predictive weight than the participant’s protective signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and directness of PSS-linked signals:
  - Participant 1 shows several strong, PSS-linked indicators: moderately high anxiety (GAD-7) with a very large correlation to PSS, very poor subjective sleep (PSQI) with moderate correlation, plus nocturnal HR elevations tied to PSS. These are direct predictors of higher PSS in that study’s covariance structure.
  - Participant 2’s strongest signals are protective (very low CES-D and STAI-Trait, high self-esteem, good sleep regularity, strong circadian stability). The risk signals (sedentary behavior, late sleep timing, modestly elevated HR mesor/amplitude) have smaller correlations with PSS in that sample and are described as lower-magnitude countervailing features.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s highest-z features that align with PSS (PSQI z = 1.32, nocturnal HR z ~1.0, GAD-7 elevated with strong correlation) are more directly tied to PSS than Participant 2’s high-z sedentary metrics whose links to PSS are described as modest.
- Within-sample conclusions: the original syntheses both conclude Participant 1 is above their population mean and Participant 2 is below theirs. Given the relative strength of direct PSS correlates in Participant 1 versus the strong protective profile in Participant 2, the balance points to Participant 1 having worse perceived stress.

Decision
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS (more perceived stress).

- Integrative note: although objective circadian and daytime physiology are relatively protective, the strongest predictors in this dataset (anxiety, emotional lability, poor subjective sleep, pain) point coherently toward above-mean perceived stress. The summary explicitly infers stress above the population mean.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (relative to their population mean 21.65)
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity and fragmentation, which in this sample modestly associate with higher PSS:
  - Low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.07) and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87).
  - Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.74) and attenuated amplitude (Z ≈ −1.03).
- Some hourly heart-rate deviations (e.g., early-morning elevated HR, pronounced 6–7am peak) that show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23).
- Integrative note: these wearable signals point toward physiological patterns that modestly relate to higher perceived stress, but the effect sizes are smaller and the summary concludes these do not override strong protective self-report indicators.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Strength and direction of predictors:
  - Participant 1’s higher-stress indicators are dominated by self-report measures that have large correlations with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 r = 0.80, PSQI r = 0.59, Emotional Lability r = 0.67). Those are high-weight signals supporting above-mean PSS.
  - Participant 2’s higher-stress indicators are primarily wearable circadian metrics with smaller associations to PSS (correlations mostly small-to-moderate), while self-report, mood, sleep, and behavior measures strongly indicate below-mean PSS.
- Net balance:
  - For Participant 1, multiple strong, convergent self-report predictors favor above-mean perceived stress despite some protective physiological markers.
  - For Participant 2, the strongest and most direct measures (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, happiness, sleep quality, health behaviors) consistently indicate below-mean perceived stress; circadian irregularity provides a counter-signal but of smaller magnitude and consistency.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
Based on the relative strengths, consistency, and magnitude of indicators (especially the high-correlation self-report measures in Participant 1 vs. the weaker wearable-based risk signals in Participant 2), Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher PSS score.

- Markedly severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ +1.51) — this construct has a very strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75), making it a dominant risk factor.  
- Substantially disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83) combined with very short median sleep duration (~4 h 55 min) and late sleep onset (~01:42) — sleep problems that relate strongly to higher PSS.  
- High pain and activity interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.44; PAPAS Z ≈ +1.63) — additional stressors that reduce coping capacity and correlate positively with PSS.  
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73) — a robust negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), indicating reduced coping confidence.  
- Objective nocturnal physiological hyperarousal — large positive hourly HR deviations at night (e.g., 12–1 AM deviation Z ≈ +2.83; 2–3 AM Z ≈ +2.14) consistent with arousal/fragmented sleep and linked to higher PSS.  
- Integrated effect size and correlations: several high‑impact indicators (anxiety, self‑efficacy, pain, nocturnal HR) have relatively large Zs and/or strong correlations with PSS in this cohort, supporting an inference of PSS above the population mean (mean = 20.62).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 24; Z ≈ +1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI trait Z ≈ +0.76) — both positively associated with PSS (moderate correlations).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ +1.52), very late median sleep onset (~03:56) and shortened sleep (median ≈ 6 h 1 min; Z ≈ -1.45) — sleep timing/insufficiency that typically increase perceived stress.  
- Blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63) and some within‑day fragmentation and late‑night HR elevation — objective markers consistent with stress‑related circadian/physiological dysregulation.  
- Behavioral inactivity (no regular exercise) — a factor that can co‑occur with higher stress.  
- However, several protective/mitigating features (no substance use, strong GPA, social/leisure engagement, above‑average interdaily stability) reduce likelihood of very high PSS; the description infers a modestly elevated PSS above the study mean (mean = 21.63) rather than extreme elevation.

Comparative reasoning in the within‑population frames
- Both participants are interpreted as above their respective study means. Participant 1’s strongest risk signals (severe clinical anxiety with a large sample correlation to PSS, very low self‑efficacy, high pain interference, and pronounced nocturnal HR deviations with extremely large Zs) are both larger in magnitude and more tightly linked to PSS in the sample than most of Participant 2’s indicators.  
- Participant 2 shows meaningful elevations (depression, PSQI, late/short sleep, reduced amplitude), but these z‑scores are generally more moderate than Participant 1’s largest z‑scores and the self‑report/physiologic predictors for P2 are tempered by several protective factors (no substance use, good academic functioning, some interdaily stability).  
- Physiological evidence of nocturnal hyperarousal is much stronger for Participant 1 (night HR deviations with Zs >2) than for Participant 2 (more modest late‑night HR elevation), and P1’s very low self‑efficacy and high pain add additional independent risk domains that are not present for P2.  
- Given effect sizes and correlations reported in each summary (e.g., anxiety → PSS r ≈ 0.75 for P1), the balance of evidence indicates a higher overall perceived stress burden for Participant 1 relative to Participant 2 (each judged within their own population context).

22,89652,10,28,"Potential reasons why Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; z = 0.83) — PSQI has a fairly large sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Extremely short median wearable sleep (1 hr 44 min; z ≈ -1.24) and variable sleep start times — objective pattern that aligns with the high PSQI and supports clinically meaningful sleep disruption.
- High pain and activity interference (PEG-3 ≈ 7.78, z = 0.71; PAPAS z ≈ 0.8) — pain measures have moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), so these meaningfully push stress upward.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal (midnight–early morning positive deviations) that modestly correlate with PSS (r up to ~0.42).

Potential reasons why Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:54) and modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m; z ≈ -0.76).
- Large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD z = 1.62) and elevated intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythm (IV z = 1.30).
- Low 24-hour autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.87) and slightly higher mean daily naps (z ≈ 1.49), consistent with fragmented/irregular circadian structure.
- Note: these wearable/circadian indices have only small positive correlations with PSS in this sample (e.g., r ≈ 0.13–0.15), so their contribution to higher PSS is modest.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1 is described relative to a population mean PSS = 21.5 as being near that mean with a modest upward shift driven primarily by sleep disturbance and pain; crucially, those two domains have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.58; pain r ≈ 0.52–0.56). Although Participant 1 also has strong protective signals (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, robust circadian amplitude, low RHR), the presence of multiple elevated predictors that have substantive associations with PSS supports an inferred PSS at or modestly above the population mean.
- Participant 2 is described relative to a population mean PSS = 21.6 as likely below the mean. While there are objective signs of circadian/sleep irregularity (late sleep, high variability, elevated IV), these metrics have small correlations with PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.13–0.15). By contrast, Participant 2’s subjective mental-health and wellbeing measures are strongly favorable (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem and happiness, good PSQI) and therefore provide stronger evidence for lower perceived stress relative to their cohort.
- In short: Participant 1’s elevated predictors of stress (sleep problems and pain) have larger, more direct sample-level associations with PSS than Participant 2’s wearable-derived irregularity metrics, and Participant 2’s subjective/wellbeing signals strongly indicate lower-than-average PSS.

Overall balance of evidence and decision
- Given the relative strengths of the predictors and their sample correlations with PSS, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit a higher PSS (near or modestly above their population mean) than Participant 2 (likely below their population mean).

2,89142,38,0,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean = 21.67)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 48; Z = +0.66). STAI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.34), so this is a relevant risk signal.
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45), a large deviation that, although only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample, commonly aligns with greater perceived stress.
- Short and variable objective sleep (median 5 h 50 min; Z = −1.68; sleep SD Z ≈ +0.51), which is frequently associated with higher stress and daytime dysfunction.
- Low exercise, limited socializing, and low happiness (Zs ≈ −1.6 to −0.5 range), behavioral features that can increase perceived stress.
- Synthesis in the description explicitly infers the participant’s PSS is modestly above the sample mean (i.e., above-average but not extreme).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean = 20.33)
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21; Z = +2.04). GAD-7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.71), making this a very salient predictor of high PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 18; Z = +1.49) and objectively extremely short sleep (median 3 h 42 min; very high night-to-night variability), both of which correlate with and amplify perceived stress.
- High pain and pain interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28), which is strongly associated with increased stress.
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = +2.42), indicating instability that typically coincides with elevated perceived stress.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = −2.29), removing an important coping buffer (NGSE negatively correlated with PSS).
- Wearable indicators of circadian disruption (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability) and nocturnal heart-rate deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal—these objective signals corroborate the strong self-report risk profile.
- The description explicitly infers PSS is above the sample mean, with multiple large-Z risk factors outweighing protective signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the magnitude and number of high-risk indicators differ.
- Participant 1 shows several moderate-risk signals (STAI +0.66, short sleep ~−1.68, very low health satisfaction large negative Z) but also several protective/attenuating features (good subjective sleep quality PSQI = 4; low depressive symptoms; stable circadian metrics; low resting HR; no substance use). The net inference was “modestly above” the population mean.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, large, and highly PSS-relevant deviations (GAD-7 Z ≈ +2.04; emotional lability Z ≈ +2.42; pain Z ≈ +2.28; NGSE Z ≈ −2.29; extremely short objective sleep) and those measures have strong correlations with PSS in this sample (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71, PSQI r ≈ 0.41). Few protective features are present and do not offset the severity of the risk signals.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 2’s profile contains more numerous and larger-magnitude risk indicators that are strongly associated with PSS, including severe anxiety, extreme sleep restriction, high pain/interference, emotional lability, and low self-efficacy. These are collectively consistent with a substantially higher PSS relative to Participant 2’s population mean.
- Participant 1’s risk signals are fewer and generally more moderate; they are balanced by several clear protective/neutralizing signals. The net inference for Participant 1 was only a modest elevation above the population mean.

- Wearable circadian markers consistent with stress: elevated intradaily variability (Z = +0.53), low interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.45), and reduced amplitude (Z = -0.92). In this dataset these features correlate with higher PSS (r directions noted).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed), which commonly associates with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 40, “anxious”) and reduced current happiness (Z = -0.53), both aligning with greater perceived strain.
- Integrated interpretation in the description explicitly infers a modest elevation in PSS (above the population mean but not extreme; within ~1 SD).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Very strong self-report signals tied to stress: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z = +2.04) and extremely poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18, Z = +1.49). In this sample these measures have large positive correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71; PSQI r ≈ 0.41).
- Markedly disrupted objective sleep: extremely short median sleep (≈3 h 42 min) and very high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min), both strongly associated with higher perceived stress.
- High pain and interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z = +2.28) and substantial emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = +2.42), indicating psychosocial/somatic burden that typically elevates perceived stress.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -2.29), a trait that amplifies perceived stress.
- Wearable circadian disruption (intradaily variability Z = +1.15, low interdaily stability) and dampened amplitude/mesor (Z ≈ -0.9 and -1.14) consistent with deconsolidated rhythms; nocturnal HR elevations that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51).
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is above their population mean PSS, with multiple high-Z indicators outweighing a few protective features.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Both participants are described as being above their respective population means. However, the magnitude and multiplicity of stress-linked indicators differ markedly.
- Participant 1 shows mixed evidence: circadian fragmentation and PSQI >5 point upward, but objectively adequate and regular sleep (~7 h 54 min, Z = +0.89), low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and generally healthy behaviors mitigate the stress signal. The description infers a modest elevation in PSS (likely above the mean but not extreme, roughly within ~1 SD).
- Participant 2 shows multiple large, concordant deviations in measures tightly correlated with PSS: severe anxiety, extreme objective and subjective sleep loss, high pain/interference, emotional lability, and low self-efficacy, many with Z-scores >2. These indicate a substantially stronger and more consistent elevation above the population mean than Participant 1’s profile.
- Even allowing for slightly different population means (P1 mean 21.62; P2 mean 20.33), the strength and breadth of Participant 2’s elevated indicators (severe anxiety, extreme sleep restriction, high pain, low self-efficacy, circadian disruption) suggest a higher absolute and relative PSS than Participant 1.

- Resting heart rate modestly above the study mean (RHR Z ≈ +0.55), and RHR correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14).
- Slightly lower momentary happiness (current happiness Z ≈ −0.53), which correlates negatively with PSS (so lower happiness could reflect higher stress).
- Low habitual physical-activity/exercise frequency (relative to peers), a behavioral risk factor that can be associated with higher perceived stress (although correlations in this sample are small).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z = +2.04) and very strong association between GAD-7 and PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.49) with a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.41).
- Objective extreme sleep restriction (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min) and high night-to-night variability—robust objective indicators that commonly accompany high perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28).
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42).
- Very low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), a trait that amplifies perceived stress.
- Circadian and HR features consistent with fragmentation and nocturnal physiological arousal (e.g., elevated intradaily variability, nocturnal HR deviations that correlate moderately with PSS r ≈ 0.48–0.51).
- Although there are some protective signs (low substance abuse, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR Z ≈ −0.93), the number, magnitude, and PSS-relevance of the elevated risk indicators are large.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is coded relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is characterized by multiple protective signals (many Zs in the protective direction: long/regular sleep Zs ≈ +1.9 for duration, PSQI Z ≈ −1.72, circadian stability Zs ≈ +1.5–1.6, low CES‑D/STAI), and the few risk signals noted are small in magnitude and/or weakly correlated with PSS in that sample. Overall the profile is most consistent with PSS below that population mean (21.62).
- Participant 2 is characterized by multiple large-magnitude deviations (many Zs ≈ ±2 or greater) on measures that have strong sample correlations with PSS (especially GAD-7 and PSQI). Objective physiology (very short sleep, high variability, nocturnal HR arousal) corroborates the self-report dysfunction. The pattern is explicitly interpreted in the description as above that population mean (20.33).
- Importantly, several of Participant 2’s elevated indicators have substantially stronger correlations with PSS in their sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71) than many of Participant 1’s protective indicators do in their sample (e.g., circadian amplitude r ≈ −0.17). This makes the inference of higher perceived stress for Participant 2 both larger in magnitude and more directly tied to PSS-linked measures.

Overall weighing of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple convergent protective signals and only weak/small risk signals → likely below their population mean PSS.
- Participant 2: multiple large, convergent risk signals (both self-report and objective) with strong sample correlations to PSS, and only a few modest protective signals → likely substantially above their population mean PSS.
- Comparing across the two within their own frames, Participant 2’s pattern indicates a higher level of perceived stress than Participant 1’s pattern (even accounting for different sample means), because Participant 2 shows larger-magnitude, high-PSS-correlated abnormalities while Participant 1 shows robust protective features and only minor risk signs.

  - Modestly elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES‑D Z ≈ 0.59; STAI‑Trait Z ≈ 0.17), both positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28 and 0.31).
  - Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (RHR Z ≈ 0.83; mesor Z ≈ 1.32), small positive correlation with PSS.
  - Late sleep timing (median sleep onset ~01:39) and somewhat short median nightly sleep (6 h 32 min; Z ≈ -0.81).
  - High nap frequency (mean daily naps 0.3; Z = 2.66), which can reflect daytime sleepiness or stress‑related compensation.
- Indicators pulling away from high PSS:
  - Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4; Z = -1.26).
  - Strong circadian regularity and low fragmentation (high interdaily stability, high 24‑h autocorrelation, low intradaily variability) — metrics associated with lower PSS in this sample.
  - Protective lifestyle markers: no substance use, good academic performance, some regular exercise, low recreational distractions.
- Study-frame note: These mixed signals are described relative to Participant 2’s study mean (population PSS mean = 21.62); the assessors conclude the participant is near the study mean with only a slight tendency toward higher PSS.

- Strength and magnitude of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple, large‑magnitude indicators strongly tied to PSS in that study (severe anxiety, extreme objective and subjective sleep disruption, high pain, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy). These are high Zs and include physiological features (nocturnal HR elevations) that directly correlate with PSS.
- Participant 2’s risk signals are smaller in magnitude and more mixed: modestly elevated mood/anxiety scores and somewhat elevated resting HR, but several strong protective, objective rhythm markers and good subjective sleep that are associated with lower PSS.
- Although the two participants’ population means differ (20.33 vs 21.62), the task requires comparing each participant’s inferred position relative to their own sample. Relative to their respective samples, Participant 1 is characterized as clearly above average stress with many convergent strong indicators; Participant 2 is characterized as near the sample mean with mixed opposing signals.
- Therefore, within this framing, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely has the worse (higher) perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.62)
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.76, Z ≈ 1.51), indicating within-day fragmentation correlated (modestly) with higher PSS in this sample.
- Very large evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., 10–11 pm +22 bpm, Z ≈ 2.46), suggesting pronounced evening physiological arousal linked to stress/rumination or situational demands.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.2), both modestly associated with higher perceived stress.

Protective/mitigating reasons for Participant 2 (reduce likelihood of high PSS)
- Low depressive and anxiety symptom scores (CES-D = 6, STAI–Trait = 31; both well below sample mean and moderately correlated with PSS), strong signals for lower perceived stress.
- High self-esteem, regular exercise, minimal substance use—all associated with lower stress.
- Adequate average sleep duration (median ~7 h 34 m) with low variability and relatively low resting HR—objective buffers against high PSS.
- Overall integrated interpretation in the profile places this participant near or slightly below the population mean.

- Participant 1 demonstrates several high-Z, strongly stress-linked features (especially severe anxiety and extreme sleep loss) that strongly point to elevated perceived stress relative to their cohort.
- Participant 2 shows some situational/physiologic indicators of arousal but stronger and multiple protective factors that pull their likely PSS toward or below their cohort mean.
- Even accounting for different population means, the magnitude and number of strong risk indicators in Participant 1 outweigh Participant 2’s situational elevations; thus Participant 1 is the more likely to have the higher PSS (worse perceived stress).

These metrics correlate positively (albeit modestly) with PSS in the sample (sleep variability r ≈ 0.13).
- Fragmented daily physiology: elevated intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythm (z = 1.30) and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (z = -0.87), which are associated with greater perceived stress (intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15).
- Compensatory daytime sleep/napping (mean naps z = 1.49), consistent with disturbed nighttime sleep and possible daytime impairment.
- Overall balance: subjective measures favor low stress, but several objective wearable-derived circadian/sleep markers provide modest convergent evidence for greater stress liability.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.42).
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (2–6 am) show larger negative deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), suggesting a modest link between certain nocturnal cardiovascular patterns and higher perceived stress.
- Overall balance: these are relatively isolated signals; the strongest psychometric and physiological indicators (very high self-efficacy, very low GAD-7, low interpersonal/emotional distress, high interdaily stability and amplitude, very low RHR) strongly favor lower perceived stress.

Comparative within-sample reasoning:
- Both participants are described as likely below their respective population means, but the strength and consistency of evidence differ.
- Participant 2’s low PSS inference is supported by very strong, highly correlated indicators (NGSE r = -0.60; GAD–PSS r = +0.75; interdaily stability/amplitude and very low RHR with sizable z-s), so the probability that their PSS is well below the population mean is high despite the PSQI flag.
- Participant 1’s subjective and self-report measures strongly indicate low stress, but several objective circadian and sleep-regularity markers point toward disrupted rhythms. Those objective markers have smaller correlations with PSS in the sample, so they provide only modest evidence of elevated stress; nevertheless, they create a more mixed profile than Participant 2’s largely-concordant low-stress profile.
- Therefore, relative to their study-specific means, Participant 1 appears closer to the population mean or at greater risk for elevated PSS than Participant 2, who shows multiple strong indicators of lower-than-average perceived stress.

- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.43): a substantial contributor to perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = 1.03) with strong association to PSS (r ≈ 0.63): indicates affect regulation problems linked to higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS composite) that correlate positively with PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) and related negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.66): fewer perceived coping resources likely increase perceived stress.
- Some objective signs of evening/night arousal (e.g., elevated late-evening HR deviations) that align with subjective sleep complaints.

Comparative, within-frame reasoning
- Participant 1’s strongest signals point toward below-average perceived stress for their cohort: very low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ -1.38) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ -1.81), high self‑esteem/happiness (Zs ≈ +1.6), strong circadian regularity (amplitude Z ≈ +1.78, interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.0) and low resting HR — all of which are associated with lower PSS. The features consistent with higher PSS for P1 are present but modest in effect size (PSQI Z ≈ 0.13, late sleep timing, some evening HR deviations).
- Participant 2’s self-report profile contains multiple strong, convergent predictors of above-mean PSS in their cohort. Crucially, the GAD-7 elevation is both large and very highly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.74), and PSQI and emotional lability are also meaningfully elevated with substantial correlations to PSS. Although objective physiology for P2 shows some protective circadian organization and low resting HR, the subjective measures that most strongly predict PSS are elevated and carry more weight in predicting perceived stress.
- Between the two participants, the magnitude and predictive strength of Participant 2’s elevated subjective measures (especially anxiety and poor sleep) exceed the modest stress-related signals in Participant 1. Conversely, Participant 1’s strong protective signals (very low anxiety/depression, high positive affect, robust circadian metrics) argue for lower-than-average PSS in their cohort.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 1, given the strong, convergent subjective indicators that are highly correlated with PSS in their study sample versus Participant 1’s primarily protective profile.

- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI-trait = 52 (Z = +1.06) and STAI-trait is a relatively strong positive correlate of PSS in this sample (r = 0.31). This is a primary risk signal pushing PSS above the cohort mean (21.59).
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D = 17 (Z = +0.38; classified “Depressed”), which correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.28).
- Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 9 (Z = +1.05), a substantial positive predictor of PSS in this dataset.
- Objective sleep pattern consistent with stress: short median sleep (5 h 58 min, Z = −1.52) and very late sleep onset (~02:25 AM), increasing likelihood of reduced recovery and higher perceived stress.
- Circadian fragmentation/instability: elevated intradaily variability (Z = +0.46) and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = −0.19), both associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Physiological arousal signatures: somewhat elevated resting HR and mesor (Zs ≈ +0.47 and +0.95) and pronounced evening HR deviations (5–6 pm deviation Z ≈ +1.69) indicating periods of sustained activation compatible with stress.
- Integrated picture: multiple domains (anxiety, depressed mood, subjective sleep, objective circadian/HR signatures) converge toward an above-mean PSS inference for this population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 16 (Z = +0.83) and PSQI has a strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.58), which pushes inferred PSS upward.
- Wearable sleep metric flagged as very short: median recorded sleep 1 h 44 min (Z = −1.24); if valid, this would be a major stressor, although measurement artifact / non-wear is a plausible caveat.
- Pain and interference: PEG-3 average and PAPAS composite elevated (Zs ≈ +0.71 and +0.80), both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), supporting higher perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal (midnight–early morning deviations), modestly correlated with PSS.

Protective/offsetting reasons in Participant 2 (important context)
- Very low generalized anxiety: GAD-7 = 2.5 (Z = −1.2) and GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.75). This is a strong protective indicator against high PSS.
- Low emotional lability and good interpersonal functioning (Zs ≈ −1.17 and −0.87), and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.12), with self-efficacy strongly inversely correlated with PSS (r = −0.68).
- Robust circadian and cardiovascular markers: low intradaily variability (Z = −1.35), high amplitude (Z = +1.38), above-average 24-hr autocorrelation (Z ≈ +0.64), and low resting HR (54.1 bpm, Z = −1.02) — features that are associated with lower PSS in this sample.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Participant 1’s inferred above-mean PSS is supported by multiple converging risk signals across psychological (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms), subjective sleep (PSQI), objective sleep timing/duration, circadian fragmentation, and physiological arousal. Several of these signals have moderate correlations with PSS in that sample, and many independent domains point in the same direction.
- Participant 2 has two clear risk domains (subjective sleep and pain/interference) that would raise PSS relative to their sample mean (21.5). However, these are counterbalanced by very strong protective indicators that have high sample-level predictive power for lower PSS (notably very low GAD-7 with a strong r = 0.75 relationship, and high self-efficacy with r = −0.68), plus robust circadian/physiologic resilience markers. The wearable sleep estimate for Participant 2 is also potentially artifactual, reducing the certainty of that risk signal.
- Thus, while Participant 2 may be modestly above their sample mean due to sleep/pain, the overall balance of evidence for Participant 2 is nearer the cohort mean and substantially attenuated by strong protective factors. Participant 1’s multimodal profile shows more consistent and multi-domain elevation of risk indicators tied to PSS.

Judgment
- Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (i.e., a higher PSS relative to their study population mean) than Participant 2.

9,45076,12,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean of 21.6)
- Modest elevations in trait anxiety (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 15; Z = 0.18); both measures have positive correlations with PSS in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, clinically meaningful) and irregular sleep timing (late median sleep start ~00:57; night-to-night SD ≈ 63 min), which are reported to associate with higher PSS.
- Reduced circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = -0.74) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.32), plus some early‑morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), suggesting nocturnal/early-morning arousal links to stress.
- Lower recent happiness and lower health satisfaction (small negative Zs) that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Reasons in Participant 1’s profile that argue against higher PSS (context for weighing)
- Relatively strong protective signals: high self‑esteem (Z = 1.38), frequent exercise (Z > 1.0 on items), low substance use, low BMI, adequate objective nightly sleep duration (median 7 h 38 min; Z = 0.56), and generally healthy physiology—these are associated with lower PSS and temper the risk signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean of 21.42)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) with a moderate sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.46).
- Very short objective sleep duration (median ~3 h 27 min; Z = -0.66), large night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 197 min; Z = 0.62), elevated napping (Z = 1.24), and very high intradaily variability (Z = 2.29; r with PSS = 0.24) — all indicators that, in this sample, trend toward higher PSS.
- Elevated interpersonal strain on BASIS‑24 (Z = 0.94), which could contribute to stress (though its sample correlation with PSS is small/ambiguous).

Reasons in Participant 2’s profile that argue against higher PSS (context for weighing)
- Very low anxiety (GAD‑7 = 4; Z = -0.94). Critically, GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.76), so this is a powerful indicator of lower perceived stress.
- High self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = 0.49) and NGSE is strongly inversely correlated with PSS (r = -0.65), again a large protective predictor.
- Very low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 emotional lability Z = -1.67) and low pain scores (PEG‑3 Z = -1.28), both associated with lower PSS or weak associations.
- Resting HR and heart‑rate diurnal patterns are not suggestive of elevated stress; some daytime HR elevations correlate with lower PSS in the sample.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s sample frame
- Participant 1: several small-to-moderate risk indicators (anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, circadian irregularity) point modestly above their population mean, but these are substantially offset by strong protective factors (notably high self‑esteem and regular exercise) and generally healthy physiology. The original summary concluded “near the mean, possibly slightly above.”
- Participant 2: the profile is mixed but dominated by a few very strong protective predictors (low GAD‑7 and high NGSE), both of which have large sample-level correlations with PSS and predict lower perceived stress below that population mean, despite severe sleep restriction and circadian fragmentation. The original summary concluded “below the population mean.”

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The magnitude of sample-level associations matters: Participant 2’s strongest protective indicators (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65) are much more predictive of PSS than the modest correlations for many of Participant 1’s risk indicators (STAI ~0.31, CES‑D ~0.28, and smaller correlations for self‑esteem/exercise). Although Participant 2 has very concerning objective sleep restriction and fragmentation (important risk signals), the summary explicitly interprets the overall profile as leaning below that study’s mean because the largest, most predictive measures favor lower stress.
- Participant 1 is described as near the sample mean with a modest tilt above it; Participant 2 is described as below their sample mean. Thus, relative to their respective population baselines, Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher PSS.

3,97596,13,32,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s population frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), so this is a meaningful risk factor.
- Pain/interference: PEG-3 ≈ 4.9 and PAPAS ≈ 50 (above median; correlations with PSS ≈ 0.42–0.47), suggesting pain-related burden that can elevate perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54 (reduced social support potential), which may increase stress for this individual even if its sample correlation with PSS is small.
- Mild anxiety and elevated baseline physiology: GAD-7 = 5.5 (mild), mesor and resting HR Z ≈ 1.16–1.22 (weakly associated with PSS but consistent with greater arousal).

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower (not higher) PSS (context on protective factors)
- High general self-efficacy: NGSE = 38, Z ≈ 1.41; NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63), a major protective factor.
- Strong circadian/behavioral regularity: high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, strong 24-h autocorrelation (Zs strongly protective).
- Emotional stability and low substance use: emotional lability Z = -0.67 and substance-use Z = -1.62 (both linked to lower PSS risk).
- Long objective sleep duration and regular sleep timing (median ~9 h 41 min, Z ≈ 1.47), which could be physiologically protective despite poor subjective sleep.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Marked depressive symptoms: CES-D = 33, Z ≈ 2.05 (strong indicator; depression correlates positively with PSS).
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15, Z ≈ 3.83 (large effect; subjective sleep problems strongly co-occur with and amplify perceived stress).
- Elevated trait anxiety and low positive affect/self-regard: STAI Z ≈ 0.56; low happiness Z = -1.61; lower self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ -0.31) — these align with higher PSS.
- Physiological/circadian signs of dysregulation: resting HR Z ≈ 0.65 and intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.81 (consistent with greater arousal and rhythm fragmentation associated with higher PSS).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or mitigated) PSS (protective factors)
- Relatively long and consistent objective sleep: median 8 h 10 min (Z ≈ 1.22) and low night-to-night variability (Z ≈ -0.92), which can be protective for mood/stress.
- Regular exercise and social engagement: exercise Z ≈ 1.07 and social time Z ≈ 0.95 (small protective associations).
- Low substance use and active coping (music engagement Z ≈ 2.06) that may buffer stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and balance of evidence
- Both participants show mixed profiles, but the key difference is magnitude and clinical salience of risk indicators relative to their respective study norms.
- Participant 1: several moderate risk signals (disturbed PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain, mildly elevated HR) are substantially counterbalanced by strong protective factors—especially high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 1.41, a strong inverse correlate with PSS) and very robust circadian/behavioral regularity. The integrated interpretation in the description is near or slightly below the study mean (mean = 21.38, SD = 7.34).
- Participant 2: multiple large-magnitude risk signals, most notably very high depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ 2.05) and extremely elevated subjective sleep problems (PSQI Z ≈ 3.83). Physiological signs (RHR, intradaily variability) and reduced positive affect add corroboration. Protective behaviors are present but appear insufficient relative to the strength of affective and sleep-related risk signals. The integrated interpretation in the description is above the study mean (mean = 21.59, SD = 3.64).
- Because each description is already framed relative to its own population mean, we compare the severity of deviations and clinical significance within each frame: Participant 2’s deviations (especially PSQI and CES-D) are larger and more clinically salient than Participant 1’s risk deviations and are less offset by protective factors. Participant 1’s strongest single effect is a protective one (NGSE), which weighs against elevated PSS.

Overall determination
- Participant 2 is the better-supported candidate for higher overall perceived stress.

5,67192,14,31,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their profile)
- Elevated internalizing symptoms that are PSS-relevant: high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; Z = 1.95) and high trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z = 1.65). Both are stated as among the stronger predictors of higher PSS in that study (correlations ~0.27 and 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep) and large night-to-night variability in sleep timing/duration (sleep timing SD ≈ 110 min, duration SD ≈ 108 min), which correlate positively with PSS in that sample.
- Elevated tonic/evening physiological arousal: high mesor (Z = 2.01), higher resting HR (Z = 1.62), and pronounced evening HR elevations (evening-hour Z ≈ 1.5), which support a stress-like arousal signature.
- Low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.03) and low BMI may add to the distress signal (even if correlations with PSS are weaker).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their profile)
- Severe and objectively-supported sleep disruption: PSQI = 13.5 (very disturbed) and median wearable sleep ≈ 3 hours/night, plus extreme night-to-night sleep-start variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). These sleep metrics are strongly correlated with PSS in that study (PSQI r ≈ 0.50) and are highly consequential for perceived stress.
- Anxiety and affective instability strongly tied to PSS: GAD-7 = 9 with very high correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); emotional lability also elevated and highly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse (Z = 1.75) and pain scores that correlate positively with PSS, adding further stress-relevant burden.
- Circadian and HR rhythm instability: reduced interdaily stability and amplitude (Zs ≈ -1.4 and -1.1) and other rhythm disruptions that in this dataset are associated with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means. Important differences: Participant 1’s strongest signals (high CES-D and STAI) are meaningful but their correlations with PSS are modest (~0.27–0.31). Several protective/attenuating signals (normal objective sleep duration, strong interdaily regularity, high social time) are present and moderate the stress inference.
- Participant 2’s highest-impact signals for PSS combine (a) extremely short objective sleep (≈3 hrs), (b) very large sleep timing instability (Z = 2.82), and (c) psychological measures that have very large correlations with PSS in that sample (GAD-7 r = 0.78; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68). These indicators are both large in magnitude and tightly linked to PSS in that study, producing a stronger, more coherent upward signal. Protective signals for Participant 2 (very high self-efficacy, lower resting HR) are notable but appear less able to offset the severity and PSS-relevance of the sleep and anxiety/substance signals.

Overall balance and conclusion
- The evidence for elevated perceived stress is stronger and more PSS-specific for Participant 2: extreme objective sleep deprivation and very PSS-correlated anxiety/lability measures indicate a larger deviation in PSS-relevant dimensions than Participant 1’s profile, whose strongest predictors have more modest PSS correlations and are partly counterbalanced by robust circadian regularity and social support.
- Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their population frame and, comparatively, the worse profile).

- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = +0.83) — PSQI correlates moderately-strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Wearable sleep metrics consistent with severe nocturnal disruption (median sleep 1 h 44 min, Z ≈ -1.24; high sleep start SD) — these objective indications, if valid, align with the PSQI and push inferred PSS upward.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 (7.78, Z = +0.71) and PAPAS (Z = +0.8) — both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56) and thus likely increase perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with night-time arousal that weakly correlate with PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within P2’s population frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance and problematic sleep timing: PSQI = 9 (Z = +1.05); median sleep 6 h 9 min (Z ≈ -1.29); very late median sleep start (~03:36; start-time SD Z ≈ +1.04). PSQI and timing variability are positively associated with higher PSS.
- Strong circadian dysregulation: very low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.98), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.95), blunted amplitude (Z ≈ -1.38), low 24-hr autocorrelation — these features consistently point toward greater stress in this dataset.
- High nap frequency (mean daily naps Z ≈ +3.05) — a strong, atypical positive signal linked (weakly) to higher PSS here.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.17) and modestly higher depressive symptoms; combined with behavioral/academic stressor (GPA drop) these contribute to higher perceived stress.

Comparative weighing in the appropriate within-population frames
- Strength and coherence of risk signals: Participant 2 displays multiple coherent risk factors for higher PSS (subjective poor sleep + objectively disrupted and irregular circadian physiology + very high nap frequency + trait anxiety + external stressor). Those signals are consistent and reinforce each other.
- Participant 1 has several prominent risk signals (high PSQI and pain/interference, and some nocturnal HR arousal), but these are counterbalanced by strong protective factors that are highly predictive in this sample: very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -1.2) — and GAD-7 has one of the strongest correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.75), higher self-efficacy (inverse correlate r ≈ -0.68), low emotional lability, robust circadian regularity (low IV, good interdaily stability), and low resting HR. Those protective indicators are substantial and reduce the net likelihood that P1’s PSS is well above the mean; the integrated summary appropriately characterized P1 as near the mean with only a modest upward push from sleep/pain.
- Relative magnitudes and credibility: P1’s wearable median sleep (1 h 44) is an extreme objective value but flagged as possibly artifactual (non-wear). Even accepting it, the protective psychiatric/self-efficacy signals are strong predictors against high PSS. By contrast, P2’s sleep/circadian and behavioral signals are multiple, consistent, and not similarly offset by strong psychological resilience indicators (P2’s low RHR and low substance use are modest protective factors but weaker predictors of PSS than the combined sleep/circadian + anxiety signals).

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 shows a more consistent and multi-domain pattern pointing toward perceived stress above their study mean, whereas Participant 1 shows mixed signals with powerful protective predictors that keep their inferred PSS close to the sample mean (only modestly elevated). Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8 (Z ≈ +0.59), above the clinical cutoff, a commonly linked contributor to higher PSS.
- Circadian irregularity: markedly reduced interdaily stability (Z = −1.56) and high sleep-start variability (sleep start SD Z = +1.48), behavioral patterns associated with greater perceived stress and poorer recovery.
- Lower momentary happiness and slightly reduced self-esteem (Zs ≈ −0.53 and −0.17), which align with higher PSS.

The countervailing signals (PSQI and small nocturnal HR correlations) are relatively isolated and weaker in relation magnitude.
- Participant 2: Several moderate-but-convergent indicators point toward higher-than-average perceived stress in their study: trait anxiety and PSQI both favor higher PSS, substantial circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z = −1.56; sleep timing variability Z = +1.48), lower momentary happiness, and some elevated cardiovascular markers. Protective factors (long nocturnal sleep, regular sports participation, normal depressive symptoms) moderate but do not fully counterbalance the multiple stress-related signals.

- Wearable-derived signs of nocturnal disruption (median recorded sleep duration extremely short at 1 hr 44 min, high night-to-night start-time variability) that align with the PSQI and could reflect genuine sleep loss/arousal that increases perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 average Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.8), which moderately correlate with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.52–0.56) and would push inferred PSS upward.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations consistent with arousal (small-to-moderate correlations with PSS).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Strongly elevated affective symptoms: CES-D and trait anxiety both >1 SD above the sample mean (z ≈ +1.32 and +1.35). These measures are known to co-vary with PSS (moderate positive correlations reported here).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI >5) plus late median sleep onset (~02:38) and high night-to-night variability in sleep timing/duration (sleep SD z ≈ +1.23; start-time SD z ≈ +0.92) — irregular timing and disturbed sleep are associated with higher PSS in this study.
- Reduced circadian stability and flattened amplitude (interdaily stability z ≈ -0.82; amplitude z ≈ -0.23), consistent with less-structured rhythms linked to elevated stress.
- Elevated late-evening heart-rate deviations (large positive z’s up to +2.25), suggesting physiological activation during winding-down hours (aligned with nocturnal arousal and stress).
- Additional self-report signals consistent with distress: low happiness and trust (z’s ≈ -1.6 to -2.1) and below-average health satisfaction.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Strength and magnitude of predictors: Participant 2 shows multiple high-loading psychological risk indicators that are >1 SD above their study mean (CES-D, trait anxiety). These are strong, direct correlates of PSS in that sample. By contrast, Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are PSQI (Z ≈ +0.83) and pain (Z ≈ +0.7–0.8) — notable but smaller deviations.
- Protective signals: Participant 1 has several robust protective features relative to their cohort (GAD-7 very low Z ≈ -1.2, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability, regular circadian structure, low resting HR). These substantial protective signals argue against a marked elevation in PSS. Participant 2 also has some buffers (long objective sleep duration, low resting HR, regular exercise, social/leisure), but these appear less offsetting given the magnitude of the affective disturbances and rhythm disruptions.
- Consistency of multimodal evidence: For Participant 2, affective self-report, circadian/sleep irregularity, and evening physiological activation converge toward higher stress. For Participant 1, evidence is mixed: sleep and pain point upward, but multiple strong psychological and physiological resilience indicators point downward.
- Population SD context: Participant 1’s study SD for PSS is large (SD ≈ 7.16) and their profile is described as near sample mean (with only modest uplift). Participant 2’s study SD is smaller (SD ≈ 3.67) and the report explicitly concludes the participant is likely above that mean, plausibly between median and upper quartile.

Balance of evidence and determination
- Overall, Participant 2 displays stronger, more numerous, and larger-magnitude predictors of elevated perceived stress within their study frame (notably >1 SD affective symptoms, clear circadian disruption, late/variable sleep timing, and physiological signs at night). Participant 1 has important risk factors (poor sleep, pain) but also several substantial protective factors (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy, stable circadian structure) that temper the inferred PSS toward the study mean.
- Therefore, weighing the relative magnitudes, consistency, and number of risk signals (each evaluated against its own population mean), Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

  - Note: GAD‑7 shows the strongest sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), but this participant’s GAD‑7 is only mild (5.5), so that strong risk is not present.
- Integration: there are real stress‑relevant risk factors (poor subjective sleep, pain, interpersonal strain), but their correlations with PSS are moderate; the participant’s anxiety level is low.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighting of evidence
- The descriptions are each relative to their own study population means (P1 mean = 21.59; P2 mean = 21.38).
- Participant 1 is described as having multiple symptom‑level signals (depression, trait anxiety, low self‑esteem) and circadian fragmentation that consistently point toward above‑mean perceived stress. These signals are directly tied to PSS in the sample, though correlations are small‑to‑moderate.
- Participant 2 has notable risk factors (very poor subjective sleep, pain, interpersonal strain), but also very strong protective factors: high general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 1.41) with a strong inverse correlation to PSS (r ≈ −0.63), marked circadian/behavioral regularity (large positive Zs for interdaily stability and autocorrelation), low emotional lability, minimal substance use, and only mild anxiety. The integrated assessment explicitly characterizes Participant 2’s inferred PSS as near or slightly below their population mean.
- Magnitude and strength: several of Participant 2’s strongest predictors are protective and include one of the dataset’s largest correlations with PSS (NGSE r ≈ −0.63), which plausibly counterbalances their moderate risk factors. Participant 1 lacks a comparably strong single protective correlate (exercise/substance use effects are weaker correlationally) and shows multiple symptom elevations tied to higher PSS.

Overall judgment
- Taking the within‑population inferences and the relative strength of predictors into account, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (i.e., be above their study mean), while Participant 2 is characterized as near or slightly below their mean due to strong protective resources.

4,14571,31,12,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ +1.51) — the single strongest correlate with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83) and short median sleep (~4 h 55 min) — both directly tied to higher PSS.  
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS, Z ≈ +1.4–1.6) — these reduce coping capacity and correlate positively with PSS.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73) — a robust negative correlate of PSS (low self-efficacy → higher perceived stress).  
- Nocturnal physiological hyperarousal: large late-night HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83) and late sleep onset (~01:42) — objective physiological pathway consistent with increased perceived stress.  
- Multiple large-effect symptom signals (anxiety, sleep, pain, self-efficacy) converge in the same direction, outweighing modest protective features.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Very high sedentary/screen time (video games, TV, internet with large Zs) — could reduce active coping and be linked to worse stress outcomes (though correlations with PSS are modest).  
- Low social-trust score (Z ≈ -2.39) — potential interpersonal stressor that can elevate perceived stress.  
- Later median sleep start (~01:04) and very low exercise frequency — timing and lack of physical activity can contribute to stress vulnerability.  
- Modestly elevated HR mesor and amplitude (HR mesor Z ≈ +1.35, amplitude Z ≈ +1.72) and slightly higher resting HR — possible signs of greater tonic cardiovascular activation that weakly correlates with PSS.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each summary is given relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their population mean (PSS mean = 20.62), driven by large, high-impact symptom signals (especially severe anxiety and disturbed sleep) with strong sample correlations to PSS. Objective physiology (nocturnal HR elevation) reinforces that higher-stress inference. Protective signals (good interdaily stability/amplitude, low intradaily variability) are present but described as partial mitigators that do not overturn the strong symptom signal.  
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as below their population mean (PSS mean = 21.64). The strongest signals are large-magnitude protective indicators: essentially no depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0), very low trait anxiety (STAI-T Z ≈ -2.11), high self-esteem/happiness, good subjective sleep (PSQI = 3), and very strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and low intradaily variability with large positive Zs). The risk signals (high sedentary/screen time, low trust, late sleep timing, low exercise, somewhat higher HR mesor) are present but are smaller in effect for PSS in the sample and are outweighed by the robust protective symptom profile.  
- Relative signal strength favors Participant 1 having higher perceived stress: Participant 1’s indicators are high-impact predictors of PSS (large Zs and high correlations), whereas Participant 2’s stress-related risk factors are weaker, more behavioral, and are counterbalanced by strong low-symptom and circadian-resilience signals.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of evidence (magnitude and relevance of predictors within each sample), Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

21,93699,30,13,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong, proximate predictors: Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12) which has a very high correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77).  
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5; z = +1.32), a moderately strong correlate of PSS, and substantially worse than Participant 2’s PSQI.  
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: pronounced overnight HR elevations (e.g., +11.9 bpm at midnight–1am, z ≈ +1.02) that correlate positively with PSS, indicating physiological nighttime arousal/poor recovery.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) with a strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ −0.66), consistent with higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24) and a high substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ +1.5) add to the risk profile even if some of these have small direct correlations with PSS.

Reasons Participant 1 might NOT have as high PSS
- Adequate objective sleep duration (median ≈ 7 h 19 min; z ≈ +0.66) and low sleep variability, which weakly relate to lower PSS.  
- Lower resting HR (57.9 bpm; z ≈ −0.64) and reasonably preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation—physiological signs that partially counterbalance psychological distress.  
- Overall the profile is mixed but dominated by high-impact psychological signals (anxiety, subjective sleep, nocturnal HR).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 9; z ≈ +1.05), a known PSS correlate.  
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T = 44; z ≈ +0.27) and negative affect/low health satisfaction, which align with higher perceived stress.  
- Late, somewhat shortened and variable sleep timing (median sleep ≈ 6 h 51 min, z ≈ −0.42; sleep start ~00:59), plus very high evening internet use (z ≈ +2.19) — behavioral patterns that can sustain or exacerbate stress.  
- Modestly elevated resting HR and mesor (HR z ≈ +0.74–+0.79), consistent with low-to-moderate autonomic activation associated with greater PSS in this sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might NOT have as high PSS
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 8), steady academic performance (GPA ~3.4), limited substance use, and regular social/exercise contacts — all protective against very high perceived stress.  
- Good interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.8), indicating preserved circadian regularity, which is associated with lower PSS.  
- Overall the elevation is described as modest-to-moderate rather than extreme.

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are interpreted as above their respective study means, but the strength and concentration of high-impact predictors differ. Participant 1 shows multiple high-weight predictors tightly linked to PSS: a clinically meaningful GAD-7 score with very high correlation to PSS, an extremely elevated PSQI (worse than Participant 2’s), and objective nocturnal HR elevations that map to poorer recovery. Those indicators are high-impact in the P1 study frame and were emphasized as driving an above-mean assessment with moderate confidence.  
- Participant 2 also has above-mean risk signals (subjective sleep disturbance, late/short sleep, high evening internet use, modestly elevated resting HR), but several strong protective signals (low depression, good circadian stability, social/exercise engagement, limited substance use) were highlighted and the overall elevation was characterized as modest-to-moderate. The physiological elevations for P2 are smaller and described as sustained low-to-moderate activation rather than pronounced nocturnal arousal.  
- Given the larger-magnitude, high-correlation psychological markers in Participant 1 (notably the GAD-7 and extreme PSQI) plus clear nocturnal HR arousal, the balance of evidence indicates a relatively higher perceived-stress burden for Participant 1 compared with Participant 2 (even allowing for different population means).

24,79341,33,15,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong, convergent subjective signals tied to PSS: very high GAD-7 (18; Z = 1.51; r with PSS = 0.74), very high PSQI (18.5; Z = 1.65; r = 0.43), and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r = 0.63). These measures are both large in magnitude and highly correlated with PSS in the sample, so they strongly push PSS upward.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS composite) and reduced self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; r with PSS = -0.66) further align with higher perceived stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely above the population mean (20.54) because the subjective predictors (especially anxiety and sleep complaints) outweigh protective physiology.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some subjective indicators point toward more stress: modest trait anxiety (STAI ≈ 41; correlates with PSS r ≈ 0.31), very low momentary happiness (Z = -1.61), somewhat short sleep (<7 h; Z ≈ -0.51) and late sleep timing (≈01:50), and slight intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.32). These factors could elevate PSS relative to that participant’s cohort.
- Behavioral patterns (high video-game time) might be associated with stress in complex ways.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighting
- Participant 1’s subjective elevations are larger in magnitude (multiple Zs > 1.0) and include measures that have strong correlations with PSS in that study (notably GAD-7 with r = 0.74). The study-level interpretation explicitly ranks P1 as above their population mean (20.54).
- Participant 2’s stress-relevant signals are smaller and more mixed: objective physiology and circadian regularity are strongly protective (interdaily stability and 24h autocorrelation Zs ≈ 0.9; RHR Z ≈ -1.18), and the study-level interpretation places P2 near-to-slightly-below their population mean (21.63).
- Although P2’s cohort mean (21.63) is higher than P1’s cohort mean (20.54), the magnitude and predictive strength of P1’s elevations (especially anxiety and subjective sleep problems) outweigh P2’s modest/ambivalent subjective signals and robust physiological resilience.

Overall judgment
- Participant 1 is much more likely to have a higher absolute PSS (worse perceived stress) than Participant 2, based on the stronger, convergent subjective predictors and the study team's conclusion that P1 is above their cohort mean while P2 is near-to-below theirs.

- Clinically elevated mood/anxiety symptoms: CES‑D = 24 (Z ≈ 1.11, “Depressed”) and STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86, “anxious”); both measures have positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31) and are the strongest psychosocial indicators pointing toward higher PSS in this participant.  
- Disturbed, late, and irregular sleep: PSQI > 5 (disturbed), very late median sleep onset (~01:44), and high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 1.32). Sleep disturbance/variability are positively associated with PSS in the sample and support higher stress.  
- Reduced circadian regularity: lower interdaily stability, lower amplitude, low 24‑hour autocorrelation (Zs ≈ -0.5 to -0.7) — a pattern linked to worse mood/stress.  
- Social and health vulnerability signals: low social trust (Z ≈ -1.74) and lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95) could contribute to greater perceived stress.
- Relative weight: these factors are flagged in the summary as the most salient drivers of an above‑mean PSS for this participant (and the summary explicitly interprets the integrated pattern as above the study mean PSS = 21.6, SD = 3.66).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe subjective and objective sleep problems: PSQI = 10 (disturbed; PSQI correlates moderately with PSS, r = 0.46), very short median sleep (3 h 27 min, Z ≈ -0.66), high sleep‑duration variability (Z ≈ 0.62), increased naps (Z ≈ 1.24). Poor sleep metrics in the sample are associated with higher PSS and are prominent here.  
- Fragmented/rest–activity organization: very high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 2.29; r with PSS = 0.24) suggests circadian fragmentation that trends with higher PSS.  
- Interpersonal strain: elevated BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale (Z ≈ 0.94) could add psychosocial stress (although its direct correlation with PSS in the sample is small).

Comparative, within‑population considerations
- Direction of each profile relative to its population mean: the Participant 1 summary explicitly concludes the profile is consistent with a PSS above the sample mean (population mean 21.6, SD 3.66). The Participant 2 summary explicitly concludes the profile leans toward PSS below the sample mean (population mean 21.42, SD 7.28). These are the authors’ integrated, within‑sample judgments.  
- Strength of predictive associations: Participant 2’s strongest indicators that point away from high stress are very strongly predictive in this sample — low GAD‑7 (score = 4; Z ≈ -0.94) with r = 0.76 with PSS, and high general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 0.49) with r = -0.65 with PSS. Those two sample‑level associations are larger than the CES‑D/STAI associations for Participant 1 (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). In other words, Participant 2 has low scores on very powerful predictors of lower PSS.  
- Countervailing signals: Participant 2’s severe sleep restriction and fragmentation are strong risk signs for higher PSS but, in the sample, their predictive correlations with PSS are smaller than the GAD‑7 / NGSE associations. Participant 1’s mood/anxiety elevations and sleep/circadian disruption all point in the same direction (above mean), though individual correlations are moderate rather than large.  
- Population SDs: Participant 1’s sample SD is smaller (3.66), so a moderate upward deviation is more meaningful relative to that population than a similar absolute shift in Participant 2’s population (SD = 7.28). Participant 1’s summary explicitly described a “moderate upward deviation” from a relatively narrow distribution.

Weighing the total balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple concordant indicators (elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, disturbed/irregular sleep, reduced circadian robustness, social/health vulnerabilities) and the study summary interpretation point toward above‑mean perceived stress.  
- Participant 2: a mixed profile with severe sleep problems that would elevate stress but with very low anxiety and high self‑efficacy — two of the strongest sample‑level predictors for lower PSS — leading the integrated interpretation toward below‑mean perceived stress.

Conclusion
Taken together, and considering (a) the direction of each integrated summary relative to its own population mean, (b) the relative strengths of sample‑level correlations (notably the strong protective indicators in Participant 2), and (c) the concentration of multiple risk signals in Participant 1, Participant 1 is most likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Very late median sleep start (~01:34 AM) and possible circadian misalignment.
- Low current happiness (z ≈ -0.53) and low health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2).
- Recent academic deterioration (term GPA 1.90) — clear psychosocial stressor.
- Virtually no exercise (z ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and heavy passive media/social activity (large positive z’s for socializing/listening to music/internet use) — behavioral patterns linked to higher perceived stress.
- These behavioral and subjective factors could push their PSS above the population mean even if physiology is relatively calm.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z = 1.51) and GAD-7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74) — strongest single predictor reported.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5, Z = 1.65), with PSQI positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03) and pain/functional interference (PEG-3 elevated), both positively correlated with PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r = -0.66).
- Convergent self-report signals (anxiety, sleep problems, emotional dysregulation, pain, low self-efficacy) strongly favor above-mean PSS for this participant.
- Objective physiology (low RHR, good interdaily stability, low IV) is protective but explicitly described as insufficient to outweigh the strong subjective signal.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is described as “near the mean” for their study (mean PSS = 21.63). While they have multiple behavioral/subjective stressors, several objective and symptom measures (low RHR, robust circadian amplitude, low IV, below-mean trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, relatively high self-esteem) pull the inference toward average or slightly below-average perceived stress in that cohort.
- Participant 2 is described as clearly above their study mean (mean PSS = 20.54). Crucially, multiple high-impact self-report predictors (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, pain, low self-efficacy) with substantial correlations to PSS converge to indicate elevated perceived stress; wearable physiology appears organized but is specifically noted not to offset the subjective signal.
- Because each description is relative to its own cohort mean, the correct comparison is not raw means but how strongly each participant deviates from their own cohort expectation. Participant 1 is near the cohort mean (no strong upward deviation), while Participant 2 shows a clear upward deviation from their cohort mean driven by several high-weight self-report predictors.

Weighing evidence
- Participant 2 has multiple, strongly correlated subjective predictors indicating above-mean PSS (including the single strongest predictor available, GAD-7 with r = 0.74). Participant 1’s strongest signals are mixed and the overall integrative judgment was “near the mean” with physiological and symptom measures often protective.
- Therefore the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52), plus objectively short median sleep (6 h 1 min, Z ≈ -1.45), very late median sleep start (~03:56 AM) and large night-to-night start-time variability — sleep features that co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian and activity signals consistent with stress: reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63), modest intradaily fragmentation (IV ≈ 0.55), and late-night heart-rate elevation (nocturnal arousal).
- Low exercise (no regular exercise), a behavioral correlate of higher stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (protective factors noted in that same frame)
- No alcohol or recreational drug use (strongly negative Zs).
- Good academic performance (GPA = 3.76).
- Some social/leisure engagement and above-average interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Zs ≈ +0.3–+0.6), which are associated with lower stress.
Overall within-frame judgment: convergent signals point to PSS > mean but likely modestly elevated rather than extreme.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS (within Participant 2's study frame, mean PSS = 20.54)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = +1.51) with a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74) — this is the single strongest predictor available.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = +1.65), which is meaningfully correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = +1.03; r with PSS = 0.63), increased pain/functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS), and lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; NGSE r = -0.66) — these subjective measures converge on higher perceived stress.
- The self-report indicators are both larger in magnitude and generally have stronger sample correlations with PSS than many of Participant 1’s key predictors.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective factors in that same frame)
- Objective wearable metrics indicate relatively preserved/robust circadian organization: interdaily stability Z ≈ +0.65, intradaily variability Z ≈ -0.59, amplitude Z ≈ +0.56.
- Low resting heart rate and mesor (RHR Z ≈ -0.9; mesor Z ≈ -1.35), suggesting lower tonic arousal or better cardiovascular fitness.
- Hourly HR profile shows deep nighttime troughs and pronounced daytime peaks — objective rhythm features that, in this sample, generally predict lower PSS.

Comparative reasoning across the two within-population frames
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means. The key distinction is strength and predictive power of the subjective signals:
  - Participant 1’s strongest subjective predictors (CES-D, STAI, PSQI) have moderate correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32; PSQI r ≈ 0.43) and z-scores that indicate modest elevation (CES-D Z ≈ +1.11; PSQI Z ≈ +1.52; STAI Z ≈ +0.76).
  - Participant 2’s subjective predictors include GAD-7 with a very large correlation to PSS (r = 0.74) and a large z-score (Z ≈ +1.51), plus PSQI Z ≈ +1.65 and emotional lability Z ≈ +1.03. These subjective measures are both larger in magnitude and more tightly predictive of PSS in that sample.
- Objective data favor lower stress for Participant 2 (organized rhythms, low RHR) and are mixed-to-risky for Participant 1 (blunted amplitude, nocturnal HR elevations, very late/short sleep). However, in both descriptions, the authors give greater weight to subjective measures when they are strong predictors of PSS; for Participant 2 the subjective signal is especially strong.
- Participant 1 also has several protective lifestyle/functional markers (no substance use, high GPA, social time) that attenuate the inferred PSS elevation. Participant 2 shows physiological resilience but fewer behavioral/functional protective signs to offset the strong subjective distress.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Given the relative magnitudes (z-scores) and, importantly, the stronger sample-level correlations between Participant 2’s key self-report predictors (especially GAD-7) and PSS, Participant 2’s profile points to a higher level of perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 1’s profile does relative to theirs.
- Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

- Elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.81), which correlates modestly with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.17) and can indicate behavioral/circadian fragmentation linked to stress.
- Moderately low 24-hour autocorrelation and only moderate interdaily stability (Zs ≈ -0.28 and 0.17), suggesting some day-to-day routine variability that can accompany stress.
- Large evening heart-rate elevations (very large positive deviation at 5–6 PM, Z ≈ 4.19) and some nighttime-to-morning HR deviations that have small positive correlations with PSS; sustained evening physiological arousal can, in some contexts, elevate perceived stress or interfere with sleep/wind-down.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z = 1.51) and GAD-7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in that sample (r = 0.74) — the single strongest predictor available.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65; PSQI r with PSS = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63).
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS), which positively correlate with PSS.
- Reduced self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) where NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.66), suggesting fewer perceived coping resources.
- These subjective measures are convergent and have relatively large effect-size correlations with PSS in the sample, giving them strong predictive weight despite some protective wearable signals.

Comparative reasoning (accounting for each description being relative to its own population mean)
- Each profile is evaluated relative to its study cohort: Participant 1 is characterized as most consistent with PSS below their cohort mean (21.63) — multiple strong protective indicators (very low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high happiness, good subjective sleep, regular exercise, low resting HR, sleep regularity) outweigh the modest circadian/fragments signals.
- Participant 2 is characterized as most consistent with PSS above their cohort mean (20.54) — several strong, convergent self-report predictors (especially GAD-7 and PSQI) that have large correlations with PSS drive this inference, even though wearable physiology shows organized rhythms.
- The predictive strength matters: Participant 2’s top predictors (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, pain, low self-efficacy) have large correlations with PSS in that sample and converge on elevated stress. Participant 1’s indicators that point toward higher stress are weaker (small correlations) and isolated; the dominant signals for Participant 1 indicate below-mean stress.
- Although the two studies have different population means (P1 mean = 21.63, P2 mean = 20.54), the descriptions portray Participant 1 as clearly biased toward below-mean PSS for their cohort and Participant 2 as clearly biased toward above-mean PSS for theirs. There is no strong evidence suggesting Participant 1’s below-mean PSS would nevertheless be higher in absolute terms than Participant 2’s above-mean PSS; the relative strengths of the signals favor Participant 2 as having the worse (higher) perceived stress.

Weighed judgment
- The balance of evidence strongly favors Participant 2 as having higher perceived stress: large, convergent, and highly correlated self-report indicators in Participant 2 outweigh the modest physiological circadian concerns in Participant 1.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (disturbed sleep), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.46).
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity (Z = +2.29), indicating fragmented circadian organization that in this sample trends toward higher PSS.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ +0.94), which could contribute to psychosocial stress (though its correlation with PSS in this sample is small).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean)
- Objective circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32); these features are modestly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Shorter-than-average sleep duration and more variable sleep (median ~6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33; sleep-SD Z ≈ +0.94), which are linked (weakly-to-moderately) to higher PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure usage (TV/internet/music use Z ≈ +2.54), weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Unusual early-morning HR spikes (large positive deviations at 5–7 AM), an atypical physiological pattern that could reflect early awakenings or stress-related arousal (interpretation uncertain).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participant summaries conclude the individual is likely below their study’s mean PSS. Thus we are comparing degrees of “below-mean” and the balance of opposing indicators in each profile.
- Strength and direction of predictors: For Participant 1 the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.76; NGSE with r ≈ -0.65; very low emotional lability) point strongly toward lower perceived stress. These are high-weight indicators in that sample and the participant’s scores on them are meaningfully favorable (GAD-7 low, NGSE relatively high, emotional lability very low).
- By contrast, Participant 1’s main countervailing signals are sleeping problems and circadian fragmentation. Those sleep/circadian indicators have moderate-to-weak sample-level correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.46; other circadian r values ~0.2–0.3), so although clinically important (especially given the extreme sleep deprivation), they carry less predictive weight in this sample than the strong affective/self-efficacy indicators.
- For Participant 2, the strongest self-report predictors relevant to stress (low trait anxiety, good well-being/happiness, high health satisfaction) also argue for lower PSS, but these self-report predictors have weaker correlations with PSS in that sample than the GAD-7/NGSE do in Participant 1’s sample (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.32; CES-D r ≈ 0.29; wellbeing/health have weaker negative correlations). Participant 2’s objective circadian disruptions and shorter sleep are modestly associated with higher PSS and are somewhat more numerous/consistent than Participant 1’s objective circadian stressors (Participant 1’s objective signature is dominated by extreme short sleep but fewer other circadian markers).
- Net balance: Participant 1’s protective/self-report signals are both strong predictors of lower PSS and are clearly favorable for this person; their main adverse signal is extreme sleep loss (high clinical risk) but this carries only moderate sample-level predictive weight relative to GAD-7/NGSE. Participant 2 has favorable self-reports but those predictors are weaker (smaller correlations with PSS), while several modest objective markers point toward elevated stress. Thus Participant 2’s profile appears closer to the population mean (i.e., relatively higher PSS) than Participant 1’s profile, which more convincingly indicates below-mean PSS despite severe sleep problems.

21,79167,30,10,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any):
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.07), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74) — these features in the sample modestly correlate with higher PSS.
- Attenuated circadian HR amplitude (Z = −1.03) and some early‑morning HR deviations (including a strong morning peak Z = 3.07) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- The report notes these physiological circadian signals are the strongest wearable indicators linking to greater perceived stress for this participant, although effect sizes are smaller than the protective signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score:
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12; Z = 0.46) and this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.77).
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = 1.32) with a moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (hourly deviations around midnight–3am with Zs up to ≈1.02) that positively correlate with PSS (r ~0.22–0.39).
- Reduced self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.25) which is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ −0.66).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24) correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.68) and an elevated substance‑abuse subscale (Z = 1.5) indicating additional psychosocial risk.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning:
- Each description is given relative to its own study sample mean. Participant 1 is characterized mainly by strong protective self‑report signals (large negative z for trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high happiness and health‑satisfaction z's, good sleep quantity and subjective quality, frequent exercise), with only moderate wearable circadian irregularities that weakly-to-moderately associate with higher PSS. The source explicitly concludes Participant 1 is most consistent with below‑mean PSS for that population.
- Participant 2 shows multiple converging, high‑impact indicators that are robustly associated with higher PSS in that sample (especially anxiety and very poor subjective sleep), plus nocturnal autonomic arousal and reduced self‑efficacy. Although there are some protective objective sleep and HR metrics, the summary explicitly concludes Participant 2 is most consistent with above‑mean PSS for their population.
- The strength of the associations differs: Participant 2’s top predictors (GAD‑7 and PSQI) have relatively large correlations with PSS in that sample (notably r ≈ 0.77 for GAD‑7), whereas Participant 1’s risk signals (circadian instability and HR features) have smaller correlations and are outweighed by strong protective self‑report indicators.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 1: net profile indicates below‑mean perceived stress (protective self‑reports dominate; circadian irregularities are secondary).
- Participant 2: net profile indicates above‑mean perceived stress (several high‑impact, convergent indicators pointing toward elevated PSS).
- Therefore Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress level.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, meets threshold for disturbed sleep), which commonly associates with higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (IV z ≈ 0.95), suggesting within-day physiological fragmentation linked (modestly) to PSS.  
- Pronounced hourly heart-rate deviations at midday and late-evening (several z-scores >2), indicating episodic physiological arousal that could raise perceived stress during parts of the day.  
- Lower momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which correlates with higher PSS in the cohort.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS:
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, z ≈ 1.51) — this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75), making it a powerful predictor of elevated perceived stress.  
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16, z ≈ 0.83) and objective signs of nocturnal physiological arousal (large HR deviations 12–5 AM, some z >2), together indicating night-time hyperarousal and short sleep (median ≈ 4 h 55 min). Both strongly align with higher PSS.  
- High pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which positively correlate with PSS and reduce coping capacity.  
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), suggesting reduced perceived coping resources.  
- Multiple of these signals show moderate-to-large correlations with PSS in the sample (anxiety, PSQI, self-efficacy, pain), and several physiological measures corroborate symptom-based indicators.

Comparative, within-population framing:
- Each summary is written relative to its own study mean (Participant 1 vs mean 21.64; Participant 2 vs mean 20.62). Participant 1 is interpreted as likely below their study mean PSS, with mostly protective trait scores (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem), robust objective sleep duration/regularity, and only modest episodic arousal signals. The stress-relevant signals for Participant 1 are present but generally smaller in magnitude and weaker in their cohort correlations.  
- Participant 2 is explicitly interpreted as above their study mean PSS, with multiple large-magnitude, strongly PSS-related indicators (severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, high pain, low self-efficacy) and corroborating nocturnal physiological arousal and short sleep. Several of these features have strong correlations with PSS in that cohort, producing a coherent high-stress profile despite some circadian-regularity buffers.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 1: Mostly protective, low trait symptoms and healthy objective sleep outweigh modest episodic arousal signals → likely below their population mean PSS.  
- Participant 2: Multiple high-magnitude symptom scores with strong established correlations to PSS (especially severe anxiety and low self-efficacy), substantial sleep restriction and nocturnal HR elevation → clearly indicative of higher perceived stress relative to their population.  
- Comparing the two within their respective cohort frames, Participant 2 shows far stronger and more numerous predictors of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1 shows predictors of elevated stress.

10,18111,10,28,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (“Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.42), so this self-reported sleep problem could raise perceived stress relative to peers.
- Discordance between objective and subjective sleep: objective duration is adequate but subjective quality poor; this mismatch is commonly associated with distress and could elevate PSS.
- Night-time heart-rate deviations: early-morning hourly HR values show larger negative deviations from mesor that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These provide a modest additional stress-related signal.
- Summary caveat: these are the only notable risk signals and their correlations with PSS are smaller than the strong protective signals in this participant’s profile.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D = 27 (z = +1.42). CES-D has a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI–Trait = 48 (z = +0.66). STAI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), supporting greater stress.
- Subjective disturbed sleep: PSQI = 8 (z = +0.59), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian and sleep irregularity: Low amplitude (z = -1.48), low interdaily stability (z = -1.40), late sleep timing (~01:19), high night-to-night variability (sleep SD ≈ 113 min), and high napping (z = +2.27). These rhythm disruptions align with mood disturbance and stress.
- Elevated evening physiological arousal: pronounced evening HR deviations (8–9pm mean deviation z ≈ +1.85) suggesting heightened evening arousal that co-occurs with stress.
- Behavioral correlates: reduced restorative leisure and increased internet use, plus low self-rated happiness (z = -1.61), which are consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Protective signals exist (normal resting HR, healthy BMI, good academic performance, modest substance use, some socializing, and near-average sleep duration) but do not fully offset the cluster of elevated self-report symptoms and circadian disruption.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each profile is already interpreted relative to its own study mean (P1 vs mean 21.5; P2 vs mean 21.6). Both study means are nearly identical, so relative positions are comparable across participants.
- Participant 1: strongest and most predictive signals point toward lower-than-mean stress — especially maximal self-efficacy (NGSE = 40; rNGSE–PSS = -0.60) and very low GAD-7 (strongly predictive; rGAD–PSS ≈ +0.75), plus very regular circadian metrics and very low RHR (Z ≈ -2.23). The only substantive stress-related signals are subjective sleep complaints and modest nocturnal HR associations; these signals are weaker than the large protective signals.
- Participant 2: a constellation of elevated internalizing symptoms (CES-D, STAI), subjective sleep disturbance, low happiness, marked circadian fragmentation/low amplitude, late and variable sleep timing, pronounced evening HR elevations, and substantial napping. Several of these signals directly map onto constructs that correlate with PSS and are elevated above sample norms. Although Participant 2 has some protective/neutral physiological baselines, the self-report symptom elevations and rhythm disruption are larger and more numerous than Participant 1’s risk signals.
- Weighting the evidence: P1’s profile is dominated by strong protective predictors of low PSS (large effect sizes relative to sample), with only modest counterevidence. P2’s profile shows multiple moderate-to-strong risk signals that coherently point to higher perceived stress. Given the similar population means, the relative within-sample placements imply Participant 2 is more likely to be above their sample mean while Participant 1 is below theirs.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), a known correlate of higher PSS in this dataset.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI–Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27; classified “anxious”).
- Late, somewhat shortened, and variable sleep timing: median sleep ≈ 6h51m (z ≈ −0.42), median sleep start ~00:59, sleep start SD ≈ 89 min — these timing features link to greater perceived stress.
- High evening/late-night internet use: usage >4 hours (z ≈ +2.19) which can exacerbate sleep problems and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation: resting HR and mesor z-scores ≈ +0.74–+0.79, consistent with low-to-moderate autonomic activation associated with stress.
- Overall, the above indicators combine to support a modest-to-moderate elevation in PSS above the Participant 1 population mean (21.64), despite several protective features.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (as stated relative to their population mean):
- Very high generalized anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (z ≈ +1.51) and GAD-7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74) — this is the single strongest predictor noted.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 18.5 (z ≈ +1.65), with PSQI positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z ≈ +1.03 (r with PSS ≈ 0.63).
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS), which correlate positively with PSS and can independently raise perceived stress.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.44), which correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.66), indicating reduced coping resources.
- Although wearable circadian and cardiac measures are relatively organized/protective (low RHR, good interdaily stability, consolidated rhythms), the subjective measures that are both large in magnitude and strongly correlated with PSS dominate the inference that this participant reports substantially above-mean perceived stress (population mean 20.54).

Comparative reasoning within each population frame:
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective cohort means. The question is which participant’s profile indicates a worse (higher) PSS overall.
- Strength and predictive value of indicators: Participant 2’s elevated measures (GAD-7 z ≈ +1.51, PSQI z ≈ +1.65, BASIS z ≈ +1.03) are larger in magnitude and, importantly, are tied to stronger correlations with PSS (especially GAD-7 r = 0.74 and BASIS r ≈ 0.63). These subjective markers carry substantial predictive weight for PSS in their sample.
- Participant 1 shows several stress-linked signs (PSQI z ≈ +1.05, elevated RHR z ≈ +0.7–0.8, late sleep, high internet use z ≈ +2.19), but many of these are of more modest effect size with weaker reported correlations to PSS in this dataset; moreover Participant 1 has multiple protective features (low depression, strong interdaily stability, decent functioning) that temper the overall inference.
- The divergence between subjective and objective data is larger and more consequential for Participant 2 because their subjective elevations are both larger and more strongly associated with PSS than Participant 1’s subjective elevations. Participant 1’s largest singular z (internet use z ≈ +2.19) is not indicated as a strong PSS predictor to the same degree as GAD-7 or PSQI in Participant 2’s profile.
- Therefore, weighing magnitude, number, and predictive strength of elevated predictors, Participant 2’s profile indicates more severe perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 1’s profile indicates relative to theirs.

Decision:
Based on the balance of evidence (especially the very high GAD-7 and PSQI values for Participant 2 and their strong correlations with PSS), Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated physiological arousal: high mesor (Z ≈ 2.01) and higher resting HR (Z ≈ 1.62) with pronounced evening HR elevations. These support sustained autonomic activation consistent with stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and irregular timing: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), late sleep timing and large night‑to‑night variability—patterns that correlate positively with PSS.
- Low subjective health satisfaction and underweight BMI: very low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.03) and low BMI (17.8) contribute additional distress signals.
- Although some protective signals exist (adequate objective sleep duration, strong circadian regularity, ample social time), the strongest PSS‑related indicators in this profile (CES‑D, STAI, physiological tone, subjective sleep problems) are aligned with above‑mean perceived stress in that population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Marked subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 10.5 (worse than Participant 1), and PSQI correlates reasonably strongly with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.47).
- Pain and functional interference: PEG/PAPAS scores above median and these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54 could reduce perceived social support.
- Elevated baseline physiology: mesor and resting HR modestly elevated (Z ≈ 1.16 and 1.22), possibly reflecting increased autonomic tone.
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 5.5) is present, though low in magnitude.
- However, these risk factors are counterbalanced by strong, highly predictive protective factors (notably NGSE Z ≈ 1.41 with a large inverse correlation to PSS, and very high circadian/behavioral regularity).

Comparative reasoning within the population frames
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean (P1 mean 21.59; P2 mean 21.38), and those means are nearly identical, so relative inferences are comparable across participants.
- Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean; Participant 2 is inferred near or slightly below their population mean.
- The strongest PSS‑relevant signals for Participant 1 are large psychological symptom Z‑scores (CES‑D, STAI) and very elevated physiological tone (mesor Z ≈ 2.0). Those features are directly tied to higher inferred PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 has strong objective protective factors (high NGSE with a strong negative correlation to PSS, and very high circadian/regularity Zs). Although Participant 2 has a worse PSQI and some pain/interpersonal risk, the protective features are described as outweighing risk, producing an overall inference near/slightly below the mean.
- In sum, Participant 1 shows multiple strong risk indicators pointing above‑mean PSS that are larger in magnitude and coherence than Participant 2’s risk signals, while Participant 2’s strongest, highly predictive features are protective.

- Very elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83) and supporting wearable signal of extremely short median sleep (1 h 44 min; Z = -1.24) and large sleep-timing variability — PSQI is a relatively strong predictor (r ≈ 0.58) of PSS in this cohort.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ 0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ 0.8), both of which show moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Nocturnal HR deviations / signs of nighttime arousal that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (some hourly r up to ≈ 0.42).

Comparative framing and interpretation (within each study population)
- Both participant descriptions are explicitly compared to their own study means (P1 mean = 21.6; P2 mean = 21.5) and both summaries conclude “near the mean, with a modest tendency upward.” Thus comparisons should be made in terms of relative strength and number of risk vs protective signals within each participant’s cohort.
- Participant 1’s risk signals are generally mild-to-moderate (small positive Zs on anxiety/depression, PSQI just above cutoff, circadian irregularity moderately negative). Those are counterbalanced by several strong protective features (notably high self‑esteem Z = 1.38 and frequent exercise Z > 1, plus healthy behaviors and low substance use). Many of the P1 risk measures have relatively small correlations with PSS in that dataset.
- Participant 2’s profile contains some relatively large, strongly PSS‑linked risk indicators: a very high PSQI (strong PSS correlate) and elevated pain/interference (moderate-strong correlates). Those risk signals are more pronounced in magnitude and have larger sample correlations with PSS than many of P1’s risk signals. Participant 2 also has notable protections (very low GAD-7 Z = -1.2, high self‑efficacy, robust circadian and cardiac markers), and low GAD‑7 is itself a strong inverse predictor of PSS (r ≈ 0.75). Thus P2 has both powerful risk and powerful protective signals; the most salient elevated risk signals (PSQI and pain) nevertheless are substantial.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple mild risk signals but several strong protective resources; net inference was “near mean, possibly slightly above,” and overall deviations and PSS‑related correlations are modest.
- Participant 2: risk signals include very large subjective sleep disturbance and elevated pain/interference, both of which are moderate-to-strong predictors of higher PSS in that cohort. Although Participant 2 also has strong protective signals (notably very low anxiety and good circadian/cardiac markers), the magnitude and PSS‑predictive strength of the sleep and pain elevations are more striking than the relatively mild risk indicators seen for Participant 1.
- Given the relative magnitudes and the strengths of the sample correlations, Participant 2’s profile contains higher-amplitude risk factors that are more tightly linked to PSS (especially PSQI and pain). Even accounting for Participant 2’s strong protective indicators, the presence of very elevated sleep disturbance and pain makes it more likely that Participant 2’s perceived stress is higher (i.e., further above their cohort mean) than Participant 1’s is relative to theirs.

- The balance of evidence strongly favors Participant 2 as having a higher perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 1 relative to theirs.

- Within-day physiological irregularity: elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (0.68, z = 0.95) which modestly correlates with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17).
- Episodic physiological arousal: pronounced hourly heart-rate deviations at midday and late evening (z ≈ 2.11–3.14) that have weak positive correlations with PSS, suggesting intermittent periods of higher arousal that could raise perceived stress for portions of the day.

- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 17.5 (z = 1.32) and PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight heart-rate deviations above the mesor (e.g., +11.9 bpm at 12–1am, z ≈ 1.02) that show positive correlations with PSS (~0.22–0.39), indicating poor nocturnal recovery.
- Emotional dysregulation: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated and correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.68), consistent with greater stress vulnerability.
- Reduced self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) and some substance-abuse signal (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse z ≈ 1.5) that, together with other symptom elevations, are consistent with higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Directional judgments in each description are explicitly framed relative to that study’s mean PSS: Participant 1 is judged most likely below their study mean; Participant 2 is judged most likely above their study mean. We must compare these relative judgments and the strength of their supporting evidence.
- Strength and relevance of predictors:
  - Participant 2’s top stress indicators (GAD-7 and PSQI) are both elevated and have large sample correlations with PSS (0.77 and 0.45 respectively). Emotional lability also correlates strongly (≈0.68). Nocturnal HR elevations provide convergent physiological support. These are high-impact, convergent signals pointing toward above-mean perceived stress.
  - Participant 1’s stress-related signals are weaker and more intermittent: PSQI is modestly elevated but objective sleep quantity is robust; heart-rate intradaily variability and hourly peaks have only weak correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.17 for intradaily variability and weak positive relationships for some hourly deviations). By contrast, Participant 1 has multiple protective, strongly offsetting indicators (very low CES-D and STAI-Trait z-scores, high self-esteem, long consistent sleep, low resting HR, good circadian stability).
- Net balance: Participant 2 presents multiple moderate-to-strong risk indicators that converge (psychological symptoms with high PSS correlations + nocturnal physiological arousal + lower self-efficacy), whereas Participant 1 presents mostly protective/low-symptom trait profiles with only a few weaker, potentially episodic stress signals. The magnitude and correlations of Participant 2’s signals are larger and more directly tied to PSS in their sample than Participant 1’s weaker signals are in theirs.

Conclusion
Based on the within-population framings, the strength of correlations to PSS, and the convergence of psychological and physiological indicators, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal (hourly HR deviations with z-values up to ≈ +2.8 overnight), supporting hyperarousal that maps onto increased PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame:
- Both participants are described as above their respective study means, but the magnitude and number of strong predictors differ. Participant 1’s elevated indicators are predominantly moderate (PSQI, modestly elevated HR, late sleep) and are balanced by protective signals (low depressive symptoms, preserved circadian regularity, good functioning). Many of Participant 1’s z-scores and correlations to PSS are small-to-moderate.
- Participant 2 presents multiple, large-magnitude stress signals that are among the strongest predictors in that sample: severe anxiety (large z and very high correlation with PSS), high pain interference, low self-efficacy (substantial negative predictor), severe subjective sleep disruption, and strong nocturnal HR deviations. While Participant 2 shows some circadian regularity that may be protective, the core symptom and physiological signals are both larger in magnitude and more directly tied to PSS than Participant 1’s signals.

Weighting the balance of evidence:
- The combination of severe anxiety, low self-efficacy, substantial pain/interference, severe sleep problems, and large nocturnal HR deviations in Participant 2 constitutes a stronger, more convergent signal of high perceived stress than the moderate and mixed profile seen in Participant 1.

- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29) — given the negative correlation between self‑esteem and PSS (r ≈ −0.15), this would predict higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and objectively shorter median sleep (6 h 46 min, Z ≈ −0.52) — both tend to co-occur with higher PSS.
- Circadian/actigraphy markers indicating fragmentation: high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.09, r with PSS ≈ +0.15) and reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), plus nontrivial sleep-timing variability — all consistent with elevated PSS in this sample.
- Integration comment: several clinically relevant measures (depressive/anxiety symptoms, sleep/circadian disruption, low self‑esteem) consistently point toward above-mean PSS for this population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study population frame)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, classified as disturbed) and very short objective median nightly sleep (3 h 27 min; Z ≈ −0.66) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.46).
- High sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +0.62), increased napping (Z ≈ +1.24), and very high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +2.29; r ≈ +0.24) — circadian fragmentation and extreme sleep restriction are risk signals for higher PSS.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ +0.94), which could add psychosocial stress (though its direct correlation with PSS in this sample is small).

Comparative weighing (accounting for within-sample correlations and z-scores)
- Strength and consistency of risk signals:
  - Participant 1: Several moderate risk indicators cluster together (depression, trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, sleep/circadian fragmentation). The affective symptom measures (CES-D, STAI) are moderate positive z-scores and are established, consistent correlates of higher PSS in that population.
  - Participant 2: The most salient risk domain is severe sleep disturbance/short sleep and very high intradaily variability (notably large Z on intradaily variability). These are meaningful predictors but, in this sample, their correlations with PSS are smaller-to-moderate (e.g., PSQI r ≈ 0.46, intradaily var r ≈ 0.24).
- Presence of strong protective predictors:
  - Participant 1 has clear protective factors (frequent exercise Z ≈ +1.1–1.6, no substance use, low resting HR, above‑mean happiness) that mitigate some risk.
  - Participant 2 has particularly strong protective predictors with large sample-level associations: low GAD-7 (Z ≈ −0.94; GAD-7 r ≈ +0.76 with PSS) and high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.49; NGSE r ≈ −0.65). Emotional stability and low pain also favor lower PSS.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s positive affective symptom z-scores (~+0.8) and multiple concordant circadian/sleep risk markers are sufficient to support an above-mean PSS classification in their sample. Participant 2’s sleep-related risks are severe in absolute terms (very short objective sleep, intradaily var Z = +2.29), but the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (anxiety and self-efficacy) point strongly downwards and thus are judged to outweigh the sleep signal in that population’s correlation structure.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
- Overall balance: Participant 1 is more likely to have higher perceived stress relative to their sample mean than Participant 2 is relative to theirs. Participant 1 combines elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms plus circadian fragmentation that together point toward above-mean PSS; Participant 2’s severe sleep problems are compelling risk factors, but they are countervailed by very strong indicators of low anxiety and high self‑efficacy (which, given their large sample-level correlations with PSS, predict below-mean PSS).

10,19245,10,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) and could elevate perceived stress despite adequate objective sleep duration.
- Small-to-moderate positive associations between certain nocturnal HR deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31) — specific early-morning HR patterns could modestly relate to higher stress for this individual.
- The subjective–objective sleep discrepancy (good actigraphic duration but poor PSQI) can itself be associated with distress in some people.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 26, z ≈ +1.32) and trait anxiety (STAI = 55, z ≈ +1.35); both measures are >1 SD above the sample mean and correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), very late median sleep onset (02:38), and high night-to-night variability in sleep timing/duration (sleep SD z ≈ +1.23) — irregular/late sleep patterns commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Low happiness and trust (z ≈ -1.61 and -2.07), which align with affective distress and higher PSS.
- Reduced interdaily stability and flattened amplitude (circadian disruption), plus elevated evening/night HR deviations (z up to +2.25) — physiological and rhythm markers consistent with greater stress.
- Although there are protective features (long objective sleep, low RHR, exercise, social/leisure), the number and magnitude of affective + circadian indicators point toward higher perceived stress relative to peers.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each summary is explicitly written relative to its own population mean (P1 mean PSS = 21.5; P2 mean PSS = 21.6). The populations’ means are essentially the same, so comparisons can focus on how each participant sits relative to their cohort.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals all point toward lower perceived stress: maximal self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +1.79), very low GAD-7 (z ≈ -1.38), low emotional/interpersonal problems, high circadian stability and amplitude (z’s ≈ +1.8–+1.9), and very low resting HR (z ≈ -2.23). The high-weight predictors here (NGSE–PSS r = -0.60; GAD–PSS r = +0.75) strongly favor below-mean PSS for P1. The only substantive counterevidence is subjective sleep complaints and some modest nocturnal HR correlations.
- Participant 2 has multiple moderately-to-strongly elevated risk indicators: depressive symptoms and trait anxiety >1 SD above mean, PSQI >5, late/irregular sleep timing, reduced day-to-day rhythm stability, and evening physiological activation. While P2 has protective factors (long objective sleep, low RHR, exercise, social time), the clustering of affective symptoms and circadian/sleep dysregulation is characteristic of above-mean perceived stress in this sample.
- Magnitude and consistency favor Participant 2 as more stressed: P1 shows strong, consistent protective signals with a single notable sleep complaint; P2 shows several co-occurring risk signals (affective, sleep timing/variability, circadian instability, evening physiological activation) that together are more likely to produce an above-mean PSS.

9,67192,12,31,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: high depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 32; Z ≈ 1.95; CES‑D–PSS r = 0.27) and high trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z ≈ 1.65; STAI–PSS r = 0.31), both moderate positive predictors of PSS in that sample.
- Physiological arousal: elevated HR mesor (Z ≈ 2.01), higher resting HR (Z ≈ 1.62), and pronounced evening HR elevations — coherent with sustained arousal and consistent (if modestly correlated) with higher PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), late and variable sleep timing — these measures are positively associated with PSS in that study.
- Additional psychosocial signal: very low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.03) and low subjective happiness add to the distress signal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Severe sleep problems: very short objective sleep (median ≈ 3 h 27 min; Z ≈ -0.66), PSQI = 10 (disturbed; r with PSS ≈ 0.46), high sleep-duration variability and high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 2.29; r ≈ 0.24). These are credible stress-related risk factors.
- Increased napping and some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal score elevated), which could reflect or contribute to stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing evidence
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is characterized by signals that push above their population mean PSS; Participant 2 is characterized overall as below their population mean PSS despite severe sleep restriction.
- Strength of predictors matters: for Participant 2 the strongest sample-level predictors point toward lower PSS — notably low GAD‑7 (score 4; Z ≈ -0.94) and relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 0.49). In the sample GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.76) and NGSE strongly inversely (r ≈ -0.65), making these powerful indicators of lower perceived stress for Participant 2.
- For Participant 1, the strongest individual signals (CES‑D and STAI) are moderate predictors of higher PSS (r ≈ 0.27–0.31) but are corroborated by physiological arousal and subjective sleep disturbance, producing a coherent pattern of elevated perceived stress.
- Although Participant 2 has marked objective sleep restriction (a serious risk factor), the very strong sample-level correlations of anxiety and self‑efficacy with PSS mean that Participant 2’s low anxiety and high self‑efficacy likely offset their sleep-related risk in the study’s predictive structure.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of evidence (magnitude and direction of predictors within each study), Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

- Marked depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 33; Z = +2.05). CES‑D has a positive association with PSS (r ≈ 0.27) and this is a strong risk signal.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.56; r ≈ 0.31 with PSS).
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15; Z = +3.83) — a robust indicator given PSQI’s known moderate association with PSS.
- Low current happiness and below‑average self‑esteem (happiness Z = −1.61; RSES Z ≈ −0.31), which align with higher stress reports.
- Physiological corroboration: mildly elevated resting heart rate (RHR Z = +0.65) and increased intradaily variability (IV Z = +0.81), consistent with greater arousal/fragmentation associated with higher PSS.
- Hourly HR deviations showing elevated daytime/late‑afternoon activation further support increased physiological activation.

Protective/mitigating signals noted in the description (long stable objective sleep duration, regular exercise, social time, low substance use, music engagement) temper but do not eliminate the above risk indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their sample frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; classified “Disturbed Sleep”), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42).
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate features (early‑morning hourly deviations) that in this dataset show small‑to‑moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31); the participant’s values on those metrics are notable.

However, these are isolated signals and must be balanced against several strong indicators of lower stress (below).

Comparative, within‑study weighing of evidence
- Participant 1’s profile contains multiple convergent risk indicators (clinically high depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, very large subjective sleep disturbance, some physiological signs). While individual correlations (e.g., CES‑D–PSS, STAI–PSS) are moderate, the combination and extremity of some scores (PSQI Z = +3.83; CES‑D Z = +2.05) make a strong case for above‑mean perceived stress in that sample.
- Participant 2’s profile contains several strong, convergent protective indicators: very high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.79; NGSE–PSS r = −0.60), very low GAD‑7 (Z = −1.38; GAD–PSS r = +0.75), very low resting heart rate (RHR Z = −2.23), high interdaily stability and amplitude (Z’s ≈ +1.8–1.9). These signals have large correlations with PSS in that dataset and are consistent with below‑mean stress. The primary countervailing signal (PSQI = 7) is moderate in magnitude and isolated.
- Both descriptions are written relative to very similar population means (21.59 vs. 21.5). Within their respective frames, Participant 1 is characterized as above the sample mean (moderately elevated), and Participant 2 as below the sample mean.

Conclusion
Balancing the number, extremity, and correlation strengths of indicators for each participant, Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = 0.83) — PSQI is moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward predictor.
- Wearable sleep signals consistent with disturbance: median recorded sleep duration extremely short (1 hr 44 min, Z = −1.24) and high variability in sleep start times (SD ≈ 160 min) — these objective patterns align with higher stress when taken at face value.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 average 7.78 (Z = 0.71) and PAPAS = 78.0 (Z = 0.8); both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), supporting an upward shift.
- Nocturnal HR deviations: modest positive heart-rate deviations around midnight–early morning (some correlations with PSS up to ~0.42), consistent with nocturnal arousal that can raise perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Trait anxiety: STAI = 44 (Z = 0.27) — positively associated with PSS in this dataset.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (Z = 0.59) — above clinical cutoff and correlated with higher PSS.
- Marked circadian irregularity: very low interdaily stability (0.22, Z = −1.56) and large sleep timing variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.48) — irregular daily timing is strongly linked to higher perceived stress/regulation problems.
- Lower momentary happiness and slightly reduced self-esteem (Zs negative) — self-report affects PSS.
- Elevated cardiovascular tone signals: positive evening/night HR deviations and modestly elevated MESOR (Z = 0.46), consistent with higher physiological arousal that can accompany higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1: Evidence is mixed. The strongest upward drivers are subjective sleep problems and pain/interference (moderate-to-strong correlates of PSS). However, there are very strong protective signals—very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ −1.2; GAD-7 ~ r = 0.75 with PSS), low emotional lability, higher self-efficacy (NGSE), good interpersonal functioning, regular circadian metrics (intradaily variability low, amplitude high, low resting HR). The integrated assessment in the description is “near the population mean” with a modest uplift mainly from sleep and pain.
- Participant 2: Evidence more consistently points above the population mean. Multiple independent risk domains (trait anxiety, PSQI-defined sleep disturbance, large circadian irregularity with very low interdaily stability, reduced momentary happiness, and some HR tone elevation) converge on higher PSS. Protective signals (long median sleep duration, frequent sports participation, normal depression score) temper but do not fully counterbalance the number and magnitude of risk indicators. The integrated assessment in the description is “likely above the population mean” (mild-to-moderate elevation).

Weighing the balance
- Participant 1’s strongest risk signals (sleep + pain) are meaningful but are substantially offset by several robust protective factors (notably very low anxiety and high self-efficacy) that are strongly correlated with lower PSS in their sample.
- Participant 2 shows a broader convergence of risk across self-report (anxiety, PSQI, lower happiness), behavioral timing (very low interdaily stability, high sleep-timing variability), and some physiological tone—multiple domains point toward higher PSS, and the description explicitly infers an above-mean PSS.
- Both participants have measurement caveats (e.g., wearable sleep anomalies for P1; PSQI vs. long objective sleep for P2), but the overall evidence favors Participant 2 as more likely to exhibit higher perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83). PSQI is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample and is the single strongest risk signal for higher perceived stress.
- Wearable indications of very short median sleep (1 hr 44 min; Z ≈ -1.24) and high night-to-night sleep timing variability (start-time SD ≈ 160 min) — these align with the PSQI and would push inferred PSS upward (noting possible non-wear bias).
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.8), which moderately correlate with PSS and likely increase perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal (midnight–early-morning positive deviations) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS.

Reasons reducing the likelihood that Participant 1’s PSS is substantially above the mean
- Low anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.2) and low emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z ≈ -1.17), both strongly inversely correlated with PSS — strong protective signals.
- Higher self-efficacy (NGSE slightly above mean) and better interpersonal functioning (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ -0.87).
- Robust circadian/cardiac indicators (high HR amplitude Z ≈ +1.38, low resting HR Z ≈ -1.02, low intradaily variability Z ≈ -1.35) which are associated with lower stress.
- Net interpretation in the source: near sample mean with only a modest upward contribution from sleep and pain.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.6)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 27; Z ≈ +1.42) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Trait Z ≈ +0.66). Both measures correlate positively with PSS and are substantial self-report indicators of internalizing distress.
- Lower self-rated happiness (Z ≈ -1.61) consistent with elevated stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; Z ≈ +0.59), late and variable sleep timing, and elevated napping (nap frequency Z ≈ +2.27) consistent with fragmented sleep and stress-related sleep problems.
- Blunted/irregular circadian physiology (amplitude Z ≈ -1.48; interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.40) — patterns linked to poorer mood and stress-related outcomes.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., 8–9pm deviation Z ≈ +1.85) consistent with elevated evening physiological arousal that correlates with higher PSS in aggregate.
- Behavioral signs (reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use) that often co-occur with higher stress.

Reasons reducing the likelihood that Participant 2’s PSS is substantially higher
- Resting heart rate and BMI within normal ranges and adequate average nightly sleep duration (~7+ hrs) — some physiological and functional buffers.
- Modest substance use and some social activity; academic functioning intact. But these protective signals appear weaker than the symptom- and rhythm-related risk signals.

Comparative reasoning within the population-frame
- The two study population means are nearly identical (21.5 vs 21.6), so comparing inferred offsets from each mean is appropriate.
- Participant 1 shows notable, but relatively circumscribed risk signals (strongest: PSQI and pain/interference). Importantly, Participant 1 also displays multiple strong protective signals (low anxiety, high HR amplitude, low resting HR, low emotional lability, good self-efficacy) with several z-scores showing meaningful protective magnitude (e.g., GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.2; HR amplitude Z ≈ +1.38).
- Participant 2 shows a broader and stronger constellation of risk signals spanning mood (CES-D Z ≈ +1.42), trait anxiety, sleep disturbance and circadian dysregulation (two circadian metrics Z ≈ -1.4 to -1.48), and marked evening physiological arousal (HR Z ≈ +1.85). These elevated symptom and rhythm indicators are numerous and of moderate-to-large magnitude and are described as collectively supporting an above-mean PSS.
- The magnitudes and breadth of risk indicators are greater and more consistent for Participant 2 than for Participant 1, whereas Participant 1’s strongest risks are partially offset by several robust protective factors.

Overall judgement
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (greater PSS relative to their study mean) than Participant 1.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 20.75)
- Pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = +1.0) and a strong PSQI–PSS correlation in this sample (r = 0.47).
- Extreme objective nocturnal disruption: very short median sleep (2 h 38 min, Z = −0.94), very late sleep onset and high night-to-night onset variability (onset SD Z = +1.3), and consistent nocturnal heart-rate elevations (overnight HR Zs up to +1.59). These physiological sleep/arousal signals are meaningfully correlated with higher PSS (overnight HR r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety (GAD-7 = 10); GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this dataset (r = 0.78), so even a moderate GAD score is an important predictor of higher PSS.
- Pain-related interference slightly elevated (PAPAS Z ≈ +0.19) and pain correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely above their population mean in PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing evidence
- Strength and directness of associations: Participant 2’s principal risk features (sleep disturbance, nocturnal physiological arousal, and GAD symptoms) are directly and moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS in that study (notably PSQI r = 0.47 and GAD-7 r = 0.78). Participant 1’s strongest deviations (very low health satisfaction and short sleep) include at least one measure with only a small correlation to PSS (health satisfaction r ≈ −0.12) and other risk signals with more modest PSS correlations (STAI r ≈ 0.34).
- Magnitude and convergence: Participant 1 shows several risk z-scores but also multiple buffering/protective signals (good subjective sleep quality PSQI Z ≈ −1.26, low depressive symptoms, stable circadian metrics, low resting HR, no substance use). The summary explicitly characterizes Participant 1’s PSS as only modestly above their sample mean. Participant 2 shows strong, converging objective and subjective markers of nocturnal arousal and severe sleep disruption that are known to elevate PSS, and the summary emphasizes these as the most salient drivers toward above-mean PSS despite some protective traits (self-efficacy, low emotional lability).
- Practical impact: Participant 2’s sleep and overnight physiology (very short sleep, late/variable schedule, elevated overnight HR) represent a pattern that is likely to drive day-to-day perceived stress more directly than some of Participant 1’s risk features, particularly given the stronger correlations with PSS in Participant 2’s dataset.

Conclusion
- Overall, weighing the balance of evidence within each study frame, Participant 2 presents a stronger, more directly PSS-linked signal (sleep disruption + nocturnal arousal + clinically relevant anxiety) and thus is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs.

- Shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated night-to-night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94), both of which have small positive correlations with PSS in the dataset.
- High sedentary/leisure time (e.g., TV use Z ≈ +2.54), weakly associated with higher PSS here.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (large positive deviations at 5–7 AM), an atypical physiological pattern that could reflect early awakenings or stress-related arousal (interpretation uncertain).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample):
- Subjective sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score = 7; “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42), so perceived poor sleep is a plausible contributor to elevated PSS for this person.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (2–6 AM negative deviations with Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).

Comparative, within-sample reasoning:
- Both participant summaries conclude each person is likely below their respective study mean PSS. That said, the strength and direction of predictive signals differ markedly.
- Participant 2’s low perceived-stress indicators are very strong and highly relevant: maximal self-efficacy (NGSE Z +1.79) and extremely low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -1.38) are tied to large correlations with PSS (NGSE r ≈ -0.60; GAD–PSS r ≈ +0.75). Objective circadian markers are strongly favorable (interdaily stability and amplitude Zs ≈ +1.8–+1.9; RHR Z ≈ -2.23), all consistent with substantially lower PSS relative to that cohort.
- Participant 1 also has important protective self-report signals (low trait anxiety STAI Z ≈ -1.31; high happiness/health satisfaction), but these predictors have smaller correlations with PSS in that sample (STAI r ≈ 0.32; CES-D r ≈ 0.29). Participant 1’s wearable-derived circadian disruptions and shorter sleep are more pronounced than any comparable objective risk in Participant 2.
- In sum, Participant 2 shows stronger, more consistent evidence of being well below their cohort mean PSS, whereas Participant 1 shows a more mixed profile (subjective affect protective but objective circadian/sleep risks more evident). Thus, relative to their own populations, Participant 1 is more likely to have a higher PSS than Participant 2.

- Pain/interference: PEG-3 ~4.9 and PAPAS ~50 are above the median and pain measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).  
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = +1.54 (reduced perceived social support can increase stress, even if its sample correlation with PSS is small).  
- Mild anxiety: GAD-7 = 5.5 (positive association with PSS in the dataset, although mild here).  
- Elevated basal physiology: mesor and resting HR Z ≈ +1.16 and +1.22 (small/weak correlations with PSS but plausibly reflect higher autonomic arousal for some individuals).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI trait = 52 (Z = +1.06); trait anxiety is positively associated with PSS and is a strong contributor.  
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D = 17 (classified “Depressed”, Z ≈ +0.38); CES-D correlates positively with PSS.  
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 9 (Z ≈ +1.05), consistent with higher PSS.  
- Short, late objective sleep: median sleep 5 h 58 min (Z = −1.52) with very late sleep onset (~02:25 AM) — this pattern is clinically linked to higher stress and aligns with other symptom elevations.  
- Circadian fragmentation: elevated intradaily variability and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (both associated with higher PSS in this sample).  
- Physiological activation patterns: elevated mesor and resting HR (Zs positive) plus marked evening HR deviations (Z ≈ +1.69) indicating periods of sustained activation consistent with stress.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and weighting of evidence
- Directional inferences in each description are already relative to their respective sample means: Participant 1 was interpreted as near or slightly below the PSS mean for that sample (mean = 21.38) because strong protective factors (high NGSE Z = +1.41, pronounced circadian regularity Zs, low emotional lability) were judged to outweigh the risk factors. Participant 2 was explicitly interpreted as above the sample mean (mean = 21.59) because multiple psychological (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms), sleep (both subjective and objective short/late sleep), and circadian fragmentation indicators consistently point toward elevated stress.  
- Strength and coherence of risk signals favor Participant 2: multiple converging high-risk markers (anxiety, depression, poor subjective sleep, objectively short/late sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening physiological activation) align and have known positive associations with PSS in that dataset.  
- Participant 1 has notable isolated risk features (poor PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain, slightly elevated HR/mesor) but also has several strong, highly relevant protective features (high self-efficacy with a strong inverse correlation to PSS, strong circadian/behavioral regularity, low emotional lability, low substance use, long objective sleep). Those protective factors were judged in the description to likely offset or outweigh the risks, placing P1 near or slightly below their sample mean.  
- Physiological elevations are present in both, but physiological markers in the dataset have weak correlations with PSS, so they are secondary. The psychological symptom burden and sleep/circadian disruption (stronger and more numerous in Participant 2) are the primary drivers of inferred higher PSS.

Overall determination
- Participant 2 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (PSS above their study mean), while Participant 1 is inferred near or slightly below their study mean.

- Morning heart‑rate deviations (notably a pronounced 6–7am peak, Z = 3.07) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23) might reflect schedule- or arousal‑related stressors.
- Caveat: these signals are described as smaller in effect size and are counterbalanced by multiple strong protective self-report and behavioral indicators, so the net probability of above-mean PSS for this participant is low.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51) — this is the single strongest predictor here and correlates strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75).
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) and objective nocturnal physiological arousal (large positive HR deviations 12–5 AM, e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83; 2–3 AM Z ≈ 2.14) that align with elevated PSS (some nocturnal HR windows r ≈ 0.34).
- High pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which positively correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42) and reduce coping capacity.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ −0.61), indicating reduced coping confidence.
- Short, late, and fragmented sleep (median sleep ≈ 4 h 55 min; median sleep start ≈ 01:42) that reinforce the stress signal.
- Countervailing features are present (above-average interdaily stability and amplitude, lower intradaily variability, resting HR near mean), but these appear weaker than the constellation of severe anxiety, poor sleep, pain/interference, and low self-efficacy.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each summary is anchored to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as likely below their cohort mean PSS (mean = 21.65) based mainly on strong, protective self-report (very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high happiness, self‑esteem, good sleep quantity and quality, healthy behaviors). The wearable circadian irregularities that point toward higher PSS are modest in magnitude and have smaller associations with PSS than the protective self-report signals.
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely above their cohort mean PSS (mean = 20.62) with multiple, large, and highly PSS‑relevant signals (severe anxiety with large correlation to PSS, very poor subjective sleep plus nocturnal HR arousal, high pain interference, and low self‑efficacy). These signals are both symptomatically and physiologically aligned and have larger effect sizes than the protective circadian metrics reported for this participant.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s deviations that would increase PSS are modest and outweighed by strong protective self‑report Z‑scores (e.g., STAI Z = −1.71). Participant 2’s risk signals are several substantial positive Zs on domains tightly coupled to PSS (anxiety, sleep, pain, self‑efficacy) and are supported by concordant nocturnal physiology.

Conclusion
Given the balance of evidence (strong symptom-based predictors and supportive nocturnal physiology for Participant 2 versus predominantly protective self-report and behaviors for Participant 1, with only modest wearable circadian risk), Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

- Subjective disturbed sleep: PSQI = 9 (Z ≈ +1.05), a metric that correlates moderately with PSS in the dataset.
- Sleep-timing disruption and variability: very late median sleep start (~03:36 AM) and start-time SD Z ≈ +1.04; these timing irregularities are associated with higher PSS.
- High nap frequency: mean daily naps 0.33 (Z ≈ +3.05) — large deviation though its direct correlation with PSS is small-to-modest.
- Circadian fragmentation: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.98) and elevated intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +0.95), both modestly associated with higher stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety and mild depressive symptoms: STAI = 43 (Z ≈ +0.17; r ≈ +0.31 with PSS) and CES-D mildly above mean (Z ≈ +0.18; r ≈ +0.28).
- External/behavioral stressors: recent drop in GPA and reduced engagement in restorative solitary activities may increase perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not have very high PSS
- Low resting heart rate and low MESOR (Zs negative), which weakly associate with lower PSS.
- Low substance use and some positive self-rated health/social activity, providing modest buffering.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (as described)
- Subjective sleep complaints: PSQI = 7 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”), which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42).
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations in early morning that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS
- Very high self-efficacy: NGSE = 40 (Z ≈ +1.79) and NGSE–PSS correlation is large and negative (r ≈ -0.60).
- Minimal generalized anxiety: GAD-7 = 1.5 (Z ≈ -1.38) and GAD–PSS correlation is very large (r ≈ +0.75).
- Low emotional/interpersonal distress (e.g., BASIS interpersonal Z ≈ -2.47) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ -1.27), all aligning with lower PSS.
- Strong, regular circadian/physiological markers: high interdaily stability (Z ≈ +1.84), high amplitude (Z ≈ +1.89), good autocorrelation, low mesor and very low resting HR (RHR Z ≈ -2.23) — objective signs consistent with lower stress liability.
- Objective sleep duration and timing are adequate/stable (median ~7 h 10 min; Z ≈ +0.61), reducing the weight of the PSQI signal.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is explicitly framed relative to its own study mean (P1 mean 21.6; P2 mean 21.5). Participant 1 is interpreted in their report as above that mean; Participant 2 is interpreted as below their mean.
- Strength and consistency of indicators differ: Participant 2 has multiple strong, concordant protective indicators (very large NGSE effect and very low GAD with large correlations to PSS; strong objective circadian stability and very low RHR with sizable Zs). Participant 1’s indicators for higher stress are numerous but generally moderate in effect size (PSQI Z ≈ +1.05, circadian instability Zs ~1–2, trait anxiety modestly elevated). Some of Participant 1’s largest deviations (e.g., nap frequency Z ≈ +3.05) have only small correlations with PSS in the dataset.
- Overall evidence weight: Participant 1 shows a coherent cluster of sleep/circadian disruption plus some anxiety/depressive signals supporting an above-mean PSS within their cohort. Participant 2 shows much stronger and more predictive protective signals (especially very low GAD and very high NGSE) that place them below their cohort mean despite a moderate subjective sleep complaint.

Conclusion
- Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (relative to their respective cohorts).

22,67192,10,31,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS (within Participant 1’s population frame)
- Markedly elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = 0.83) and strong PSQI–PSS correlation in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), a substantive predictor that pushes inferred PSS upward.
- Wearable sleep evidence consistent with sleep problems: median recorded sleep duration extremely short (1 h 44 min; Z = -1.24) and high night-to-night sleep start variability (start-time SD ≈ 160 min), aligning with the elevated PSQI.
- Elevated pain and activity interference: PEG-3 average 7.78 (Z = 0.71) and PAPAS 78.0 (Z = 0.8), both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), which would increase perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal physiological arousal: modest positive overnight HR deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.42), which slightly support higher stress.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- High depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; Z = 1.95) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z = 1.65); both are among the strongest self-report predictors of higher PSS in this sample (correlations ≈ 0.27 and 0.31) and strongly push inferred PSS above the mean.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), late median sleep start (~1:15 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability—factors that correlate positively with PSS.
- Elevated tonic and evening physiological arousal: high mesor (Z = 2.01), higher resting HR (71.8 bpm; Z = 1.62), and pronounced late-evening HR deviations—physiological signals consistent with stress-related activation.
- Low health satisfaction and low BMI (Z ≈ -2.03 and BMI 17.8), which add to the overall distress signal even if their direct PSS correlations are modest.

Comparative reasoning (explicitly within each participant’s population frame)
- Direction and magnitude of key predictors: Participant 1’s strongest upward drivers are sleep disturbance (PSQI) and pain (both with moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS). However, Participant 1 also has very strong protective indicators that are tightly linked to lower PSS in that sample (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy NGSE, low emotional lability, robust circadian and cardiac markers). The high-quality protective signals (some with strong correlations to PSS, e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.75; NGSE r = -0.68) substantially counterbalance the sleep/pain risks, yielding an overall inference near the population mean with only a modest upward tilt.
- Participant 2’s profile shows large internalizing symptom elevations (CES-D and STAI Z ≈ 1.65–1.95) that are among the most salient predictors of higher PSS in that study and are supported by elevated basal and evening cardiac activation. Although Participant 2 has protective elements (objectively adequate sleep duration, good interdaily stability, extensive socializing), those protective metrics in this dataset have smaller correlations with PSS than the participant’s large depressive/anxiety scores and elevated physiological tone. Thus the net balance for Participant 2 is clearly above that study’s mean.
- Relative comparison: Participant 1 is characterized as near the population mean PSS (possibly modestly above) because strong, highly correlated protective factors offset the sleep/pain risks. Participant 2 is characterized as above the population mean with multiple convergent risk signals (large internalizing symptoms + physiological arousal). Given that Participant 2’s key risk signals are larger in standardized terms and are supported by physiological activation, while Participant 1’s large risks are partly offset by very strong protective factors, Participant 2 is the more likely to have the higher PSS relative to their respective study means.

- High sedentary and screen time (very large Zs for video games, TV, internet) — may reduce active coping and social/physical buffers against stress.  
- Low social-trust score (Z = -2.39) — potential interpersonal strain or reduced perceived support.  
- Late median sleep start (~01:04 AM) despite adequate duration — timing/social jetlag could increase stressors.  
- Modestly elevated heart-rate mesor and amplitude (Zs positive) and low exercise frequency — possible higher tonic arousal and reduced physiological stress-buffering.  
Overall frame: these are present but described as smaller-magnitude risk signals relative to the participant’s strong protective indicators (very low depression/anxiety, high well-being, robust circadian regularity).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z ≈ 1.51) and very strong correlation with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.74) — single strongest predictor of elevated PSS.

- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z ≈ 1.03) with strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.63).  
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) that correlate positively with PSS and can independently raise perceived stress.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z negative; NGSE strongly negatively correlated with PSS), reducing perceived coping resources.  
- Some late-evening HR deviations that may relate to subjective sleep/rumination problems.  
Objective circadian/HR features (interdaily stability, lower RHR) are protective but are explicitly described as insufficient to outweigh the strong subjective symptom signal.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each summary is explicitly relative to that study’s mean PSS (P1 mean = 21.64; P2 mean = 20.54). Participant 1 is judged below their population mean, with very strong protective signals (CES-D Z = -1.38; STAI-Trait Z = -2.11; circadian interdaily stability Z = 2.4; high happiness and self-esteem). The risk signals for P1 (sedentary behavior, late sleep, modestly elevated HR) are present but described as smaller in magnitude and weaker predictors of PSS in that sample.  
- Participant 2 is judged above their population mean, driven primarily by multiple self-report measures that have large effect-size correlations with PSS in that cohort (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74, PSQI r = 0.43, BASIS-24 r = 0.63). Although P2 shows several objective physiological features consistent with lower stress (organized circadian rhythms, low resting HR), the write-up explicitly states and justifies that the subjective measures carry greater weight for predicting PSS in this dataset.  
- Net comparison: Participant 1’s strongest signals are protective and large in magnitude relative to sample correlations; Participant 2’s strongest signals are risk indicators that are both large in magnitude and strongly correlated with PSS. The protective objective signals for P2 are insufficient, per the description, to counterbalance the strong subjective symptom cluster.

Conclusion
Given the balance of evidence (strong, convergent subjective predictors of high PSS for Participant 2 vs strong, convergent protective signals for Participant 1), Participant 2 is much more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Marked depressive symptoms: CES‑D = 33 (Z = +2.05). Depression in this sample is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.27), making this a salient risk signal.
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 15 (Z = +3.83). Strong subjective sleep disturbance typically co-occurs with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI Z = +0.56 (r ≈ 0.31 with PSS), adding to psychological distress.
- Physiological signs of arousal/fragmentation: higher intradaily variability (IV Z = +0.81, r ≈ 0.15) and mildly elevated resting HR (Z = +0.65, r ≈ 0.13), both modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Low happiness (Z = −1.61) and below-average self-esteem (RSES Z = −0.31) are consistent with profiles that tend to report greater perceived stress.

(Notes: Some protective factors are present—long, regular objective sleep duration Z = +1.22, regular exercise Z = +1.07, social time Z ≈ +0.95, low substance use—which temper but do not negate the multiple strong risk signals above the sample mean.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Pronounced subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (described as “Disturbed Sleep”) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in that sample (r = 0.46).
- Severe objective sleep restriction: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 27 min (Z ≈ −0.66), large sleep‑duration variability (SD Z = +0.62), and increased napping (Z = +1.24)—all consistent with physiological stress and fragmented rest–activity patterns.
- Very high intradaily variability: IV = 0.64 (Z = +2.29, r with PSS = 0.24), indicating rest–activity fragmentation associated with higher PSS.
- Some interpersonal strain: elevated BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale (Z = +0.94), a possible psychosocial stressor.

(Notes: Several strong indicators point the other direction for Participant 2—see below—so the sleep-related risks are important but counterbalanced by very strong protective signals.)

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s study frame)
- Strength and number of risk signals for Participant 1: multiple convergent psychological risk markers (very high depressive symptoms Z = +2.05, elevated anxiety), very high subjective sleep problems (PSQI Z = +3.83), plus modest physiological signs of arousal/fragmentation. Although some protective behaviors are present, the combination of high depressive symptom burden and extreme subjective sleep disturbance is a robust pattern associated with higher PSS in that sample.
- Strength and number of risk vs. protective signals for Participant 2: sleep-related measures are strongly adverse (very short objective sleep, high IV, disturbed PSQI) and would push PSS upward. However, Participant 2 also shows several very strong predictors of lower perceived stress in that sample: minimal generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 Z = −0.94) where GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r = 0.76), relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = +0.49) with a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r = −0.65), very low emotional lability (Z = −1.67), and low pain—each of which are powerful indicators of lower PSS. The summary explicitly weighs these high‑impact predictors as dominating the inference, so the overall assessment for Participant 2 leans below the study mean PSS.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple moderately-to-strong correlated risk indicators (especially high depressive symptoms and extremely elevated subjective sleep disturbance) and physiological corroboration point toward above‑mean perceived stress in their sample.
- Participant 2: while sleep metrics are strikingly poor, the largest-sample‑association predictors (low GAD‑7, high NGSE, low emotional lability) strongly indicate lower perceived stress; the original synthesis concluded the profile leans below that sample mean.

- Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52; Z = +1.06), and STAI has a positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.32).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, above clinical cutoff), which correlates with higher PSS.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z = -1.43) and modestly low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.62), psychosocial features that co-occur with greater stress.
- Behavioral markers of less regular schedule (late sleep onset ≈ 01:02 AM; interdaily stability Z = -0.57) and pronounced midday HR peaks (hourly deviations) that could reflect concentrated daytime activation.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS (relative to their cohort mean):
- Very large anxiety signal (GAD‑7 = 21; Z = +2.04, “severe”), with a strong study correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.71).
- Extremely poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +1.49) and objective sleep restriction (median sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min, high night‑to‑night variability), both strongly linked to higher PSS.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28) and high emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z ≈ +2.42).
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29), a trait that typically amplifies perceived stress.
- Wearable circadian disruption (low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.15) and nocturnal HR deviations that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Both participants are described as having inferred PSS above their respective study means. However, Participant 2’s deviances are larger in magnitude (multiple Zs > ±2) and include measures with stronger correlations to PSS (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.71 and PSQI r ≈ 0.41). Participant 2 also has severe objective sleep deprivation (median ≈ 3 h 42 min) and pronounced circadian fragmentation—objective signals that reinforce the very strong self‑report indicators.
- Participant 1 shows some above‑mean psychological risk (trait anxiety, poor PSQI) but these are moderate in size (STAI Z ≈ +1.06; PSQI modest). Participant 1 also presents several protective/mitigating features (low resting HR, relatively intact circadian amplitude/intradaily variability, strong academic functioning, modestly above‑average happiness, limited substance use) that would tend to buffer perceived stress.
- Participant 2 has a few protective features (low substance use score, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR) but these are outweighed by multiple, large-magnitude risk indicators that are strongly tied to PSS.

Overall balance of evidence:
- The evidence for elevated PSS is considerably stronger, more numerous, and more directly tied to PSS for Participant 2 than for Participant 1. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

- Emotional lability elevated (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = +0.53) and strongly correlated with PSS in the sample (r = 0.65).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations across 1–4 AM that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), plus elevated resting HR and mesor (z ≈ +1.18 to +1.37) suggesting physiological arousal.
- Extremely long median sleep and large night-to-night variability (z > +2), which indicate disrupted/atypical sleep patterns (though wearable sleep metrics have weak direct correlations with PSS in this dataset).
- However, the summary characterizes overall PSS as near the sample mean, citing protective factors (low pain burden, preserved interpersonal functioning, only mild anxiety).

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Participant 1’s profile is explicitly judged “modestly above” their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.67). Key signals driving that inference are moderately elevated trait anxiety and a very large negative deviation in health satisfaction, plus short/variable sleep and lifestyle risk behaviors.
- Participant 2’s profile is explicitly judged “near” their population mean PSS (population mean = 20.96). Participant 2 has domain-specific high-risk signals (strongly related emotional lability, high PSQI, nocturnal HR elevations), but also notable protective features and several wearable metrics that are only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample. The report therefore concludes no clear large deviation above the study mean.
- In terms of strength and extremity of deviations: Participant 1 has one very large deviation (health satisfaction Z = −2.45) and several moderate risk signals that the summary integrates into an above-mean inference. Participant 2 has several meaningful signals tied to PSS (emotional lability, PSQI, nocturnal HR), but the overall assessment is that these balance with protective signals and weaker correlations for some physiological features, resulting in a near-mean inference.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Both participants show credible signals linked to higher perceived stress in some domains. However, Participant 1 is explicitly interpreted as modestly above their study mean PSS, whereas Participant 2 is interpreted as near their study mean PSS despite some domain-specific risks.
- Given that the task is to decide which participant appears to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study populations, the description for Participant 1 provides a clearer, overall elevation above the population mean (noted large deviations in health satisfaction, elevated STAI, short sleep, and adverse lifestyle indicators) while Participant 2’s risks are more domain-specific and are judged to balance out to near-mean PSS.

- Low self‑esteem: RSES Z ≈ −1.29 (self‑esteem negatively correlated with PSS).
- Sleep/circadian risk signals: PSQI = 6 (marginal disturbance), high intradaily variability (0.70; Z ≈ 1.09), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), sleep start variability (~99 min SD), and slightly short median sleep (6 h 46 min; Z ≈ −0.52). These features correlate with higher PSS in this cohort.
- Net phrasing in the summary: integrative conclusion explicitly states PSS is likely above the population mean (moderately elevated).

Mitigating/protective features noted for Participant 1: frequent exercise (Z ≈ 1.07–1.58), no substance use, low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.42), and modestly higher happiness (Z ≈ 0.55) — these reduce inferred PSS but the summary still weights symptom and circadian signals toward above-mean stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s population)
- Strong sleep problems: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ 0.83) and wearable-recorded median sleep extremely short (1 h 44 min; Z ≈ −1.24) with large sleep start variability (~160 min SD). PSQI has a strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Pain/interference: PEG-3 average (Z ≈ 0.71) and PAPAS (Z ≈ 0.8) are elevated and positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal.

Strong mitigating/protective features for Participant 2: very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ −1.2) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ −1.17) — both strongly related to lower PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.75; BASIS r ≈ 0.62). Also higher self-efficacy (NGSE r ≈ −0.68), good interpersonal functioning, robust circadian markers (intradaily variability Z ≈ −1.35, amplitude Z ≈ 1.38, resting HR Z ≈ −1.02), and daytime HR patterns consistent with activity rather than distress. The study summary characterizes Participant 2 as near the population mean (with a modest upward contribution from sleep/pain).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants’ population means are essentially the same (P1 mean 21.59; P2 mean 21.5), so comparison can be made directly on the described deviations from each mean.
- Participant 1’s elevation is driven by multiple affective symptom indicators (depression and trait anxiety) and circadian fragmentation. Those predictors are described as consistently pointing toward above‑mean PSS, and the summary explicitly concludes a moderate elevation above the population mean.
- Participant 2 presents a stronger single-domain risk profile (notably severe subjective sleep disturbance and pain) that are moderate-to-strong correlates of PSS, but these are counterbalanced by several very strong protective indicators (especially minimal generalized anxiety, high self‑efficacy, and robust circadian/cardiorespiratory markers). The integrated judgment in the description places Participant 2 near the sample mean, perhaps modestly above it due to sleep/pain.
- Effect-size/context note: some of Participant 2’s predictors (GAD-7, NGSE, PSQI) have larger sample correlations with PSS than individual predictors for Participant 1; however, for Participant 2 those large-effect predictors are split between risk (PSQI, pain) and strong protections (GAD-7 low, NGSE high). Participant 1’s risk signals are more uniformly aligned toward higher stress and the summary explicitly tilts the inference above mean.

Weighing the overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple consistent risk signals (affective symptoms + circadian fragmentation) yield a coherent inference of moderate PSS elevation above their population mean.
- Participant 2: mixed profile with targeted strong risks (sleep, pain) but also robust, strong protective factors; the net inference is near the population mean with only a modest upward shift if any.

- Blunted heart‑rate rhythm amplitude (Z = −1.03) and some early‑morning relative heart‑rate elevations (morning peak Z = 3.07) — these signals have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample and could reflect schedule‑related or stress‑related arousal.
- Caveat: these physiological signals are described as smaller in magnitude and weaker predictors (modest correlations) than the strong self‑report indicators of low stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score

- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65), and PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.43), supporting higher stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 1.03) and pain/interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS) — both correlate positively with PSS and are consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.44) — NGSE negatively correlates with PSS (r = −0.66), indicating reduced coping resources tied to higher PSS.
- Protective/contrary evidence is present in wearables (higher interdaily stability Z = 0.65, lower intradaily variability Z = −0.59, lower resting HR and higher amplitude) but these objective features have smaller predictive weight in the description compared with the strong subjective indicators.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is characterized as below their population mean PSS (population mean 21.65): multiple strong self‑report indices (low STAI, low CES‑D, high happiness/health satisfaction/self‑esteem), good sleep quantity/quality, exercise and low substance use outweigh the modest wearable signals that trend toward higher PSS. The wearable predictors of higher PSS are described as small-to-moderate in effect and do not dominate the profile.
- Participant 2 is characterized as above their population mean PSS (population mean 20.54): several high‑magnitude self‑report predictors (especially GAD‑7 with r = 0.74) point strongly to higher perceived stress. Although objective physiology suggests resilience, the subjective measures with large correlations to PSS carry greater weight for inferring perceived stress.

- The strongest single predictor across both profiles is Participant 2’s very high GAD‑7 score with a large correlation to PSS, supplemented by severe PSQI and other elevated self‑report measures; these collectively provide convergent, high‑weight evidence for above‑mean perceived stress in Participant 2’s cohort.
- Participant 1’s profile shows multiple, robust self‑report and behavioral indicators of below‑mean perceived stress; the wearable signals suggesting higher stress are smaller in magnitude and less persuasive relative to Participant 1’s protective profile.
- Therefore, despite some physiological irregularities in Participant 1, the net evidence indicates Participant 2 exhibits worse overall perceived stress relative to their cohort.

- Elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI = 44 (Z ≈ +0.27) and CES‑D = 15 (Z ≈ +0.18); both measures correlate positively with PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (above clinical cutpoint), with late/variable sleep timing (median start ~00:57; SD ≈ 63 min) that can worsen perceived sleep quality and stress.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.74) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32), which tend to associate with higher PSS.
- Early‑morning HR deviations: some 3–7 AM heart‑rate features show small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), consistent with nocturnal arousal/worry.
- Lower subjective well‑being: reduced recent happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95), which co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons why Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep) and the documented PSQI–PSS correlation (r ≈ 0.42) suggest sleep complaints could elevate perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR patterns: larger negative early‑morning HR deviations (2–6 AM) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), which could reflect night‑time stress physiology for this individual.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each summary is relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.6; P2 mean = 21.5). The written inferences are: P1 ≈ near the mean, leaning slightly above; P2 ≈ below the mean. Thus, relative to peers, P1 is described as at or a bit above average stress, whereas P2 is described as below-average stress.
- Magnitude and balance of signals: P2 shows very strong protective indicators with large effect sizes (NGSE Z ≈ +1.79; GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.38 with rGAD–PSS ≈ +0.75; RHR Z ≈ -2.23) that strongly predict lower PSS. P1’s risk signals (small positive Zs for anxiety/depression, PSQI = 6, circadian irregularity Z ≈ -0.74) are modest and are substantially counterbalanced by strong protective features (self‑esteem Z = +1.38; frequent exercise; healthy physiology). Overall, P1’s net tilt is only slightly toward higher-than-average stress, whereas P2’s profile tilts more clearly toward lower-than-average stress.
- Therefore, even though both have some sleep-related complaints, the preponderance and magnitude of evidence indicate Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress relative to their cohort.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z ≈ +0.56), a known correlate of higher perceived stress in this sample.  
- Circadian fragmentation / higher intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +0.39) and reduced interdaily stability (IS Z ≈ −0.24), which modestly correlate with higher PSS.  
- Pronounced daytime heart-rate elevations in late morning (hourly HR deviations Z ≈ +1.9–2.1), consistent with sustained daytime physiological arousal.  
- Low reported social/recreational downtime (very low socializing minutes, large negative Z), which could reduce buffering resources against stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z ≈ +2.04), a very strong predictor of elevated PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.71).  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 18, Z ≈ +1.49) and objective extreme sleep restriction (median ~3 h 42 min, very high night-to-night SD), both strongly linked to higher PSS.  
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28) and high emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42), which typically accompany and amplify perceived stress.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), removing a coping/resource buffer and associating with higher PSS.  
- Wearable indicators of circadian fragmentation (IV Z ≈ +1.15, low IS) and nocturnal HR elevations at sleep onset that have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51).  
- Although there are some protective features (low substance use, preserved interpersonal functioning, low RHR), the magnitude and number of high-Z risk signals are large.

Comparative, within-population framing
- Participant 1’s summary explicitly places them “near to, and perhaps slightly above,” their population mean PSS (mean = 21.62). The strongest risk signal is moderate (STAI Z ≈ +0.56) and is balanced by several substantial protective factors (very long, good-quality sleep Z ≈ +2.03; frequent exercise; strong academics). Overall deviations from the population mean appear modest.  
- Participant 2’s summary places them clearly above their population mean PSS (mean = 20.33). Multiple indicators show large deviations from the sample (severe anxiety Z ≈ +2.04; extreme sleep disturbance and very short objective sleep; pain and emotional lability Zs ≈ +2+; NGSE Z ≈ −2.29). The risk signals are both larger in magnitude and more numerous than for Participant 1 and converge in direction toward higher perceived stress.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: a mixed but largely resilient profile with only modest risk signals relative to their population; overall PSS likely near or slightly above the group mean.  
- Participant 2: multiple, large-magnitude risk signals (psychological, somatic, and objective sleep/circadian markers) that align strongly with elevated PSS relative to their population.  
- Comparing within their respective populations, Participant 2 shows much greater deviation toward higher stress than Participant 1 does toward higher stress.

1,89142,17,0,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe objective sleep restriction (median sleep ≈ 3 h 30 min; large negative Z) and very late sleep timing — sleep duration/quality measures have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (e.g., PSQI r ≈ 0.48).  
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) — pain scales correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.5).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations and reduced circadian robustness (positive HR deviations late night, amplitude Z ≈ -0.34, reduced 24-h autocorrelation) — nocturnal HR deviations correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.43).  
- Convergence of multiple PSS-relevant signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal physiological arousal) that have moderate-to-strong sample-level associations with PSS, supporting an inference of above-mean perceived stress in that study population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Trait anxiety moderately elevated (STAI Z ≈ +0.66), a measure that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.34).  
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.45), a large deviation from the sample mean (though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).  
- Short and somewhat variable objective sleep (median ≈ 5 h 50 min, Z ≈ -1.68) and low happiness/social/exercise engagement — behavioral factors that commonly align with higher perceived stress.  
- Overall profile in the Participant 2 description is explicitly judged “modestly above” that study’s mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Both participants are described (relative to their own cohort means) as having perceived stress above their study’s mean. Their population means are very similar (P1 mean 21.21; P2 mean 21.67), so absolute mean differences do not materially affect the comparison.
- Strength and convergence of risk signals favor Participant 1: very extreme objective sleep deprivation (3.5 h) plus elevated pain and nocturnal physiological arousal — each of these features has a moderate-to-strong sample-level correlation with PSS, and together they form a tightly convergent set of high-impact indicators.
- Participant 2’s elevated indicators are more moderate in magnitude or have weaker sample correlations with PSS (STAI modestly elevated with moderate correlation; health satisfaction extremely low but only weakly correlated with PSS). Participant 2 also has several protective signals (good subjective sleep quality, stable circadian metrics, low resting HR, no substance use) that meaningfully offset risk.
- Participant 1 does have important protective signals (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy), and that lowers certainty; however, the severity and concordance of PSS-relevant risk markers (especially extreme short sleep and pain) likely produce a higher net PSS relative to that cohort than Participant 2’s net elevation relative to their cohort.

Overall judgement
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

2,71089,38,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean = 20.33)
- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 21 (Z ≈ +2.04), a very strong positive correlate of PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 18 (Z ≈ +1.49) and wearable-confirmed extreme short sleep (median ~3 h 42 min) with high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min) — objective and subjective sleep disruption are moderately correlated with PSS.
- High pain and interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28, contributing to elevated perceived stress.
- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42, consistent with higher stress.
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -2.29 (negative correlation with PSS), suggesting reduced coping resources that amplify perceived stress.
- Wearable circadian/sleep physiology consistent with dysregulation: low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, dampened HR rhythm, and nocturnal HR elevations (1–4am deviations) that are moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51).
- Although there are some protective features (low substance use, decent interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), they are described as fewer and less influential than the multiple, large-magnitude risk signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.62)
- Modest elevations in internalizing symptoms: STAI trait z ≈ +0.46; CES‑D z ≈ +0.28.
- Low self‑esteem: RSES z ≈ -1.57, which can elevate perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (above common clinical cutpoint).
- Low physical activity: exercise frequency z’s ≈ -1.9, a factor associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting cardiac activation: MESOR z ≈ +1.77; resting HR z ≈ +1.55 (resting HR correlates positively with PSS in the sample).
- Behavioral lifestyle factors associated with stress: high internet use and sedentary leisure (z ≈ +1.5 each).
- However, many of these signals are modest in magnitude (small-to-moderate z-scores) and are counterbalanced by several stronger protective/neutral indicators described below.

Protective/mitigating features for Participant 2 (reduce likelihood of much higher PSS)
- Objective sleep is long and consistent (median ~8 h 12 min, z ≈ +1.26) with low night-to-night variability.
- Strong, regular circadian metrics (interdaily stability z ≈ +1.33; 24-h autocorrelation z ≈ +1.23; low intradaily variability z ≈ -0.81).
- Above-average HR amplitude (z ≈ +0.83), social time z ≈ +0.95, and good academic performance — all factors that tend to mitigate perceived stress.
- The study synthesis explicitly rates this participant as “near to slightly above the population mean,” not markedly elevated.

Comparative weighing / conclusion
- Participant 1 shows multiple, large-magnitude risk indicators (several Zs ≈ +2 or greater: severe anxiety, pain, emotional lability, very short and fragmented sleep, low self-efficacy) that are strongly and directly linked to higher PSS in the study. The objective physiological signals (nocturnal HR elevation, extreme sleep restriction) further align with high perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows several risk signals but they are generally modest in magnitude (Zs mostly < |1.0| except for resting HR and some lifestyle measures) and are substantially counterbalanced by robust objective sleep and circadian regularity and other protective factors. The study summary places Participant 2 near-to-slightly-above their population mean, not strongly above it.
- Because Participant 1’s pattern contains more and larger-magnitude stress-related deviations (both self-report and wearable) relative to their population mean, Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Wearable-derived circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32) — these objective rhythm markers are modestly positively associated with PSS in that sample and would push inferred stress upward.
- Shorter and more variable sleep: median nightly sleep ~6h7m (Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94) — both have small positive correlations with PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV/internet/music use; TV Z ≈ +2.54) — weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (large positive Zs at 5–7 AM) — physiologically atypical and could reflect early awakenings/nocturnal activity that may relate to stress (though interpretation is uncertain and possibly artifactual).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.0 (Z = +0.83) and PSQI–PSS correlation r ≈ 0.58 in this sample — a strong predictor that pushes inferred PSS upward.
- Wearable sleep metrics indicating extremely short median sleep (1 hr 44 min, Z ≈ -1.24) and high sleep start-time variability — these objective signs, despite possible non-wear/artifact, align with reported poor sleep and support higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and functional interference: PEG-3 average (Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS (Z ≈ +0.8), both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56) — likely to increase perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal (midnight–early morning positive deviations) that correlate modestly with PSS.

Comparative, within-population framing
- Each description is interpreted relative to its own study’s mean PSS (Participant 1: population mean 21.59; Participant 2: population mean 21.5). Participant 1’s integrated inference explicitly concludes perceived stress is likely below that study’s mean, driven mainly by strong protective self-report signals (low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high happiness/health satisfaction). Although Participant 1 shows some objective circadian/sleep signals that are associated with higher PSS, those are described as weaker and partially ambiguous/artifactual.
- Participant 2’s integrated inference concludes perceived stress is near the study mean with a modest upward contribution (i.e., slightly above mean), driven chiefly by substantive, strongly correlated risk factors (high PSQI and pain/interference), even though robust protective factors (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, stable circadian markers) temper but do not fully negate those risks.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: strong, directly stress-related self-report indicators point toward lower-than-average perceived stress in their cohort (notably STAI–Trait Z = -1.31, high happiness and health satisfaction Zs), with objective circadian/sleep anomalies present but weaker and partly ambiguous.
- Participant 2: has several moderate-to-strong predictors of higher perceived stress in their cohort (PSQI r ≈ 0.58; pain measures r ≈ 0.52–0.56) and the description explicitly places them at or modestly above the sample mean PSS, despite protective features.
- Because Participant 1 is inferred to be below their cohort mean and Participant 2 is inferred to be at/ modestly above theirs, Participant 2 appears to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their cohort).

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z = +0.38; classified “Depressed”), also positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.28).
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05, “Disturbed Sleep”), and objective short/late sleep (median 5 h 58 min, start ~02:25 AM, Z for duration = −1.52). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS and the subjective/objective sleep pattern supports greater stress burden.
- Circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = +0.46; 24-hour autocorrelation relatively low Z = −0.19). These measures correlate with higher PSS in the sample and indicate unstable rhythms.
- Physiological arousal signals: modestly elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ +0.47 and +0.95) and pronounced evening heart-rate departures (5–6 pm Z = +1.69), consistent with sustained activation that can relate to higher perceived stress.
- Integrated pattern: multiple convergent indicators (anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening physiological activation) point above the sample mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; classified “Disturbed Sleep”), and a documented discrepancy between adequate objective sleep duration and poor subjective sleep quality. PSQI in this dataset correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42), so this is a plausible source of elevated perceived stress for this individual.
- Certain nocturnal heart-rate deviations (2–6 am negative deviations with Z ≈ −2 to −2.7) that in this dataset show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), suggesting a modest possible contribution to perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is explicitly framed relative to its own population mean PSS (Participant 1: mean = 21.59; Participant 2: mean = 21.5). Participant 1’s profile is directly interpreted by the study authors as above their sample mean; Participant 2’s profile is directly interpreted as below their sample mean.
- Strength and number of signals: Participant 1 shows multiple convergent risk indicators (anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep plus objective short/late sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening physiological activation). Several of these measures have nontrivial positive correlations with PSS in the dataset and several Z-scores are elevated.
- Participant 2 shows one clear risk signal (subjective sleep disturbance) but a larger set of strong protective signals: maximal self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.79; NGSE–PSS r = −0.60), minimal generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z = −1.38; GAD–PSS r = +0.75), very low resting heart rate (RHR Z = −2.23), high interdaily stability/amplitude/autocorrelation (Zs ≈ +1.8 to +1.9). These protective markers are both large in magnitude and tied to strong correlations with PSS in the dataset, making the inference of below-mean PSS for Participant 2 robust despite the PSQI.

Overall determination
- Balancing the number, magnitude, and PSS-relevant correlations of signals within each participant’s population frame, Participant 1’s multimodal profile is more consistent with higher perceived stress than Participant 2’s profile. Participant 2’s predominant signals point strongly toward lower perceived stress, with sleep complaints as the main exception. Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS (greater perceived stress).

- Strong, direct predictors of PSS:
  - High GAD-7 (14.5; Z = +0.9) with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.80). This is a powerful signal that aligns with higher PSS.
- Severe sleep disruption tightly linked to stress:
  - Extremely short objective sleep (median 2 h 19 min; Z = −1.04) and very late, highly variable sleep timing (start-time SD Z = +1.16). Sleep metrics in this profile strongly co-occur with elevated PSS in many samples.
- Nighttime physiological arousal and circadian disruption:
  - Elevated resting HR (Z = +1.67), low circadian amplitude (Z = −1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = −1.34), high intradaily variability (Z = +1.23), and marked nocturnal HR elevations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42). These convergent physiological features are consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Emotional lability and pain-related interference:
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = +0.33, r with PSS = 0.66) and pain burden (PEG-3 Z = +0.44, correlation with PSS ≈ 0.47) both support greater perceived stress.
- Net balance: multiple strong, convergent signals that are themselves well-correlated with PSS in this study, so the evidence for being above the population mean is robust.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some notable risk signals:
  - Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = +0.66; r with PSS ≈ 0.34), which is a moderate predictor of higher PSS.
  - Short objective sleep (median ≈ 5 h 50 min; Z = −1.68) and elevated sleep variability (Z ≈ +0.51), both commonly associated with increased stress.
  - Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45), low exercise (Z ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing and lower happiness—contextual factors that can elevate perceived stress.
- Important mitigating factors reducing the likelihood of a high PSS:
  - Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4; Z = −1.26) despite short duration.
  - Low resting HR and MESOR (Zs ≈ −1.49 to −1.89) and relatively stable wearable circadian metrics (interdaily stability slightly above average, intradaily variability below average), suggesting better physiological regulation.
  - Low-to-moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ −0.14) and no substance use—additional protective factors.
- Net balance: mixed but overall the report characterizes the participant as modestly above the study mean rather than markedly elevated.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s strongest signals (GAD-7 r = 0.80; sleep nearly absent; nocturnal HR elevations and circadian disruption) are both more extreme in absolute terms and more strongly correlated with PSS in that study than Participant 2’s strongest signals are in their study. In other words, P1 shows multiple, highly predictive indicators of elevated PSS; P2 shows some risk indicators but also several strong physiological and subjective buffers.
- Degree of deviation: P1 has extreme objective sleep deprivation (≈2.3 hours/night) and marked physiological dysregulation—effects that typically correspond to substantial increases in perceived stress. P2’s deviations (short sleep ≈5.8 hours, elevated STAI) are notable but less extreme and are partially offset by protective features.
- Consilience of modalities: P1 has convergence across self-report (anxiety, emotional lability, pain) and objective physiology (sleep, HR, circadian metrics) all pointing toward higher stress. P2’s indicators are more mixed (psychological risk vs. physiological resilience).

Conclusion
Given the greater number, magnitude, and sample-level predictive strength of stress-linked signals for Participant 1 versus the mixed/risk-buffered profile of Participant 2, Participant 1 is most likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z ≈ +1.51) — a very strong predictor of PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.75).  
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16, Z ≈ +0.83) with objective corroboration: very short median sleep (~4 h 55 min) and late median start (~01:42).  
- High pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS Z ≈ +1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ −0.61), indicating reduced coping reserve.  
- Strong physiological night-time hyperarousal: very large nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = +2.83; other nocturnal windows Z > +2), which map onto higher PSS in this sample (some nocturnal HR windows r ≈ 0.34).  
- Some mitigating wearable-derived circadian regularity (higher amplitude and interdaily stability, lower intradaily variability), but these are weaker correlates with PSS than the symptom/physiology signals above.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means. The question is which is worse relative to the person’s own sample and, by implication, which profile indicates a higher severity of perceived stress when comparing the strength of stress-related signals.  
- Participant 2’s stress-related signals include multiple large-effect, highly PSS-correlated measures: severe clinical anxiety (very high correlation with PSS), very elevated nocturnal physiological arousal with very large Z-scores, marked low self-efficacy (large negative Z with strong correlation to PSS), and substantial pain/interference. These features are coherent and mutually reinforcing.  
- Participant 1 shows several stress indicators (elevated trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening physiological activation), but the standardized effect sizes and known correlations with PSS in the cohort are generally smaller than the key drivers in Participant 2. Additionally, Participant 1 has stronger protective/resilience signals (frequent exercise, high physical-health satisfaction, high interpersonal trust) that partially offset the stress inference.  
- Taken together, Participant 2’s combination of very severe anxiety, low self-efficacy, high pain interference, and pronounced nocturnal physiological hyperarousal represent a stronger and more coherent high-stress profile (within their cohort) than Participant 1’s profile (which is elevated but has more moderate effect sizes and more notable protective factors).

- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), which correlates strongly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.61), implying reduced coping confidence and higher expected stress.  
- Marked pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Zs ≈ 1.4–1.6), contributing additional burden that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).  
- Nocturnal physiological hyperarousal: large positive heart-rate deviations at night (e.g., 12–1 AM Z ≈ 2.83) and late, short sleep—objective signals that align with the subjective disturbance and are moderately associated with higher PSS.  
- Multiple moderately strong, convergent signals (symptom scales with sizable Zs and strong correlations to PSS) point coherently toward above-mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15; Z ≈ 3.83), an extreme deviation that commonly co-occurs with and amplifies perceived stress (PSQI–PSS correlation is nontrivial).  
- Substantial depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33; Z ≈ 2.05) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.56), both positively associated with PSS and indicating considerable affective burden.  
- Wearable signs of rhythm fragmentation and activation (intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.81; resting HR Z ≈ 0.65), which modestly correlate with higher PSS and support physiological corroboration of subjective distress.  
- Despite the above, several protective features (long, stable objective sleep duration Z ≈ 1.22, regular exercise Z ≈ 1.07, social time Z ≈ 0.95, low substance use) could mitigate perceived stress even if subjective reports are poor.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s top predictors (severe anxiety and low self-efficacy) are strongly associated with PSS in their sample (r ≈ 0.75 and r ≈ -0.61 respectively). Participant 2’s strongest signal (depression, CES-D Z ≈ 2.05) has a notably weaker correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.27). Thus, similarly large Z-scores in constructs that have higher PSS correlations should drive a larger increase in expected PSS; Participant 1 has multiple such high-impact predictors.  
- Magnitude and convergence: Participant 2 has an extremely large PSQI Z (≈ 3.83), which is a salient risk signal; however, many of Participant 2’s other risk indicators have modest correlations with PSS and are partially offset by clear protective behaviors (long objective sleep, exercise, social engagement). Participant 1 shows several moderately-to-strongly elevated symptoms that all point in the same direction (anxiety, low self-efficacy, pain, nocturnal arousal) with fewer strong protective offsets.  
- Physiological corroboration: Participant 1’s nocturnal HR deviations are large and temporally specific to sleep hours, consistent with hyperarousal mechanisms linked to perceived stress; Participant 2’s physiology is more suggestive of daytime fragmentation and mild resting elevation but less specific/strongly linked to the most predictive psychological measures.  
- Net balance: Participant 1’s measures include the highest-impact correlates of PSS in their sample and multiple convergent elevated Z-scores with physiological corroboration. Participant 2 has some very large Zs (notably PSQI) and clear affective symptoms, but these are partially balanced by protective behaviors and overall weaker predictor–PSS relationships.

Conclusion
Weighing the relative predictive strength of the features (especially the very strong anxiety–PSS and self-efficacy–PSS associations in Participant 1), the overall balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

22,14571,10,12,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated sedentary/screen-time behaviors (very high Zs for video games, TV, internet) — modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample and remove active coping opportunities.
- Low social-trust score (Trust Z = -2.39) — could reflect lower perceived social support, a risk for higher perceived stress.
- Late median sleep start (~01:04 AM) and low exercise frequency — timing and low physical activity can contribute to social/scheduling strain and reduced stress-buffering.
- Modestly elevated heart-rate mesor and amplitude (HR mesor Z ≈ 1.35; amplitude Z ≈ 1.72) — small positive correlations with PSS suggesting greater tonic arousal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16.0, Z = 0.83) and extremely short wearable median sleep (1 h 44 min, Z = -1.24) — PSQI strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), making this a substantive predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ 0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ 0.8) — both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), likely contributing upward pressure on PSS.
- Evidence of nocturnal physiological arousal (hourly HR deviations around midnight) that aligns with sleep disruption and has modest positive correlations with PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each description is framed relative to its own cohort mean (P1 mean 21.64; P2 mean 21.5). Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as below their cohort mean and likely near the lower quartile — driven by very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high happiness and self-esteem, good PSQI, and strong circadian regularity. These are strong, consistent protective signals with known negative correlations to PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the cohort mean with a modest upward shift due to sleep disturbance and pain. Those two risk domains have relatively strong sample correlations with PSS (stronger than many of Participant 1’s risk signals) and are elevated for P2. Although P2 has solid protective features (very low GAD-7, higher self-efficacy, regular circadian markers, low resting HR), the high PSQI and pain measures are specifically noted as primary drivers that would push inferred PSS upward.
- The magnitudes and predictive strengths differ: P1’s strongest signals point downward (some large negative Zs on depression/anxiety and strong positive circadian Zs), while P1’s risk signals are weaker correlates of PSS. P2’s primary risk signals (PSQI and pain) are moderate-to-strong correlates of PSS and are elevated, producing a net inference closer to or modestly above that cohort mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: net profile indicates lower-than-mean perceived stress for their cohort (protective signals are strong and directly relevant to PSS).
- Participant 2: net profile indicates perceived stress near the cohort mean with a modest upward contribution from sleep disturbance and pain — overall higher relative stress than Participant 1’s clearly below-mean profile.

6,29257,20,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = -1.23) — less consistent daily timing, which in this sample is associated with higher PSS.
- Late and variable sleep timing: late median sleep onset (~01:32) and elevated night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD z = +1.14) — these patterns are linked to greater perceived stress in group-level data.
- Reduced circadian amplitude (HR cosinor amplitude z = -0.75) and some nocturnal HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS in the dataset.
- Very high relative time spent listening to music (z = +2.06), which in this sample was positively correlated with PSS (could reflect coping under stress).
Note: these are present but characterized in the summary as secondary/less direct than strong psychosocial indicators indicating lower stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) — this measure has the largest positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.77), making it a very strong predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5; r = 0.49) — a strong contributor to elevated stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 0.93; r = 0.67) and lower self-efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62; r = -0.66) — both strongly associated with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Somatic/functional burden (pain interference PEG-3 average 5.0; r = 0.44).
- Physiological/behavioral signs of arousal/disruption: high resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ +1.2–1.3), large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = +1.12), and late sleep timing — these align with higher stress or reduced restorative physiology in the sample.
Note: some wearable circadian metrics are mixed/protective (low intradaily variability, modest amplitude), but the self-report predictors are strong and directly tied to PSS.

Comparative, within-sample-frame reasoning
- Each description is explicit relative to its own study population mean PSS. Participant 1 is characterized as below their population mean (mean = 21.62) primarily because of very low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, good subjective sleep quality, and high self-esteem — all strong, direct indicators that typically map onto lower PSS. The circadian irregularities noted are risk factors but are presented as weaker or secondary signals.
- Participant 2 is characterized as above their population mean (mean = 21.08) primarily because multiple self-report measures that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (especially GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) are elevated. Wearable metrics provide additional, though mixed, support for elevated stress.
- Magnitude and predictive strength matter: Participant 1’s strongest indicators point toward lower stress with several >1 SD in the protective direction (e.g., CES-D, STAI, PSQI, RSES). Participant 2 shows multiple predictors that are known in this dataset to have strong positive correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.77), and several physiological indicators also support higher arousal.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
- Taking the balance of evidence across both profiles (and accounting for each profile being assessed relative to its own sample mean), Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11; z ≈ 1.98) and very irregular sleep timing (sleep start time SD z ≈ 2.20), plus elevated sleep duration variability (z ≈ 1.33) — sleep metrics in this dataset are positively associated with higher PSS and are the clearest risk signals.  
- Modestly blunted heart-rate amplitude (z ≈ -0.51) and some early-morning HR deviations that weakly correlate with PSS, providing secondary physiological support for higher stress vulnerability.  
- Overall inference in the description: “near the population mean, possibly slightly above it when sleep-related indicators are weighted.”

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Multiple self-report indicators strongly associated with higher PSS: moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10; r ≈ 0.77 is the strongest correlate), poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r ≈ 0.49), elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ 0.93; r ≈ 0.67), and low self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.62; r ≈ -0.66). These are high-weight predictors in the sample.  
- Wearable/physiological features that align with elevated arousal: high resting HR (z ≈ 1.31), elevated MESOR (z ≈ 1.19), and large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ 1.12).  
- Integrated inference in the description: participant’s perceived stress is “likely above the study sample mean” (population mean PSS = 21.08).

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame:
- Participant 1 is characterized as roughly at the sample mean (21.62) with a modest upward influence driven primarily by severe sleep irregularity, but several moderate-to-strong protective factors (low trait anxiety/depression, frequent group exercise, low resting HR, positive self-evaluations) that push against a high PSS. The net interpretation provided is near-mean, maybe slightly above.  
- Participant 2 is characterized as clearly above their sample mean (21.08), with multiple strong self-report predictors (especially anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties) that have large correlations with PSS in that sample and physiological markers that also point toward higher arousal. The description explicitly weighs high-correlation self-reports as primary evidence for elevated PSS.

Balance of evidence and decision:
- Both participants have sleep disturbance and some physiological indicators that could increase perceived stress, but Participant 2 has a denser cluster of high-weight predictors (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) that, in this dataset, are strongly associated with higher PSS. Participant 1’s strongest risks are concentrated in sleep irregularity but are substantially offset by several protective psychosocial and behavioral factors.  
- Therefore, Participant 2 more likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) compared with Participant 1.

10,21932,10,13,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (classified “disturbed sleep”; z ≈ +0.59). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS, so this is a plausible source of higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (0.68, z = +0.95), which correlates modestly with PSS (r ≈ 0.17) and suggests within-day physiological fragmentation linked to higher stress.  
- Pronounced hourly heart-rate deviations at midday and late-evening (z ≈ 2.11–3.14) suggesting episodic physiological arousal during specific hours; several of these hourly deviations have weak positive correlations with PSS.  
- Slightly lower momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), and lower positive affect is associated with higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.20).  
Note on magnitude: these “higher-stress” signals are mostly moderate-to-small predictors in the study (some weak correlations), and several objective/trait indicators strongly favor lower stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified “disturbed sleep”); PSQI–PSS correlation is moderate (r ≈ 0.42), so this could raise perceived stress.  
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), suggesting modest nocturnal cardiovascular patterns associated with stress.  
Note on magnitude: these are the only substantive “higher-stress” signals and are smaller in predictive weight compared with Participant 2’s very strong protective indicators.

Comparative, within-population reasoning (weighing evidence and effect sizes):
- Both participant summaries conclude each person is likely below their respective population mean PSS. So the question is which one is closer to (or above) their mean — i.e., which shows relatively higher perceived stress within their cohort.  
- Participant 1: Mixed profile. Several modest-to-small indicators point toward higher stress (PSQI, intradaily variability, pronounced HR peaks, reduced momentary positive affect), but these are outweighed in the summary by multiple protective signals (low CES‑D and STAI-Trait, high self‑esteem z = +1.66, long/regular objective sleep z = +1.31, low resting HR). Protective signals are present but generally of moderate magnitude (trait z-scores ~-1 to +1.7). The wearable HR peaks are high z-values but their sample correlations with PSS are small, reducing their weight. Net: likely below mean but with some episodic arousal that could elevate perceived stress somewhat.  
- Participant 2: Strong, converging protective signals with large effect sizes and strong correlations to PSS: very high self-efficacy (NGSE z = +1.79, NGSE–PSS r = -0.60), very low GAD-7 (z = -1.38 with GAD–PSS r = +0.75), very low interpersonal distress (z = -2.47), strong circadian stability and amplitude (z ≈ +1.8), and very low resting HR (z = -2.23). These indicators have stronger predictive relationships with PSS in the dataset than the few stress-related signals (PSQI, modest nocturnal HR correlations). Net: convincingly farther below the population mean PSS than Participant 1 appears to be.

Conclusion (balance of evidence): Both participants are described as below their sample means, but Participant 1 shows a greater mix of stress-related signals (subjective sleep disturbance, intradaily variability, daytime/evening HR peaks, muted positive affect) and fewer extremely strong protective indicators than Participant 2. Participant 2’s profile contains several very strong protective indicators with large correlations to PSS (especially NGSE and GAD‑7), making it likely that Participant 2’s perceived stress is lower relative to peers than Participant 1’s. Therefore Participant 1 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the higher PSS (i.e., worse perceived stress) within their respective cohorts.

- Strong indicators of higher stress:
  - Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI correlates r = 0.46 with PSS in this sample).
  - Extreme objective sleep restriction (median nightly sleep 3 h 27 m) and elevated night-to-night variability (sleep SD = 197 min).
  - High intradaily variability in rest–activity (IV = 0.64, Z = 2.29), a relatively large wearable-derived signal that in the sample trends toward higher PSS.
  - Increased mean daily naps and some interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 0.94).
- Countervailing reasons that point away from higher stress (make a high PSS less likely):
  - Low current anxiety (GAD-7 = 4; Z = −0.94) and this measure has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.76).
  - High self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 0.49) and low emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability Z = −1.67); NGSE and emotional lability are strongly related to PSS in the sample (NGSE r = −0.65).
  - Low pain burden and a relatively low resting heart rate; some daytime HR patterns observed in this person are actually associated with lower PSS in the sample.
- Net within-sample interpretation given in the description: mixed profile but overall leans toward below-mean PSS because the strongest sample-level predictors (low GAD-7, high NGSE, low emotional lability) point to lower perceived stress; sleep signals are important but their sample-level correlations are smaller.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Indicators consistent with higher stress or dysregulation:
  - Wearable circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.07), reduced 24‑hr autocorrelation (Z = −0.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74), and attenuated HR rhythm amplitude (Z = −1.03). These features in the sample modestly associate with higher PSS.
  - Some elevated hourly HR deviations (notably a pronounced 6–7 am peak) that correlate modestly with PSS.
- Strong evidence against higher stress:
  - Very low trait anxiety (STAI Z = −1.71) and low depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = −1.07), likely strong negative predictors of PSS.
  - High positive well‑being (happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 2.05) and elevated self‑esteem (Z = 1.24).
  - Good objective and subjective sleep (median 8 h 11 m, Z = 1.25; PSQI in “good” range).
  - Healthy behaviors (frequent exercise, low substance use, low sedentary time) and low resting HR—factors associated with lower PSS.
- Net within-sample interpretation given in the description: overall evidence favors below-mean PSS; circadian irregularity is a modest countervailing factor but smaller in magnitude than the robust protective self-report and sleep indicators.

Comparative reasoning (accounting for within-population frames)
- Both participants are inferred to be below their respective study population mean PSS in their written summaries.
- Participant 2’s protective signals are numerous and generally larger in magnitude (e.g., STAI Z = −1.71, health satisfaction Z = 2.05, sleep quantity Z = 1.25). These variables are direct mood/well‑being indicators and strongly relevant to PSS.
- Participant 1’s profile is more mixed: although they have clear protective mental‑health indicators (low anxiety, high self‑efficacy, very low emotional lability), they also have severe objective and subjective sleep pathology (extremely short sleep and very high intradaily variability). The sleep signals are substantial and directly associated with higher PSS in the sample, but the sample‑level correlations for the strongest protective predictors (GAD-7, NGSE, emotional lability) are larger than those for many sleep/circadian metrics.
- Balancing magnitudes and the strength of sample-level associations: Participant 2’s evidence for low perceived stress is both broader and more consistently strong across multiple direct self-report measures and good sleep, whereas Participant 1’s major risk (severe sleep restriction/fragmentation) is partially offset by very strong mental‑health protective indicators. Therefore, although both are inferred below their sample means, Participant 1 presents relatively greater evidence that could push perceived stress upward (notably extreme sleep disruption), making them more likely than Participant 2 to have the higher PSS (i.e., worse perceived stress) in a head-to-head comparison.

- Subjective anxiety: STAI (Z ≈ -0.03) is near the sample mean but described as “at least in the anxious range”; STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), so any anxiety signal pulls toward higher PSS.
- Low momentary positive affect: very low self-rated happiness (Z ≈ -1.61) and negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.20) suggest reduced well‑being that often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Shorter/late sleep timing: median sleep <7 h and late sleep onset (~01:50) can impair coping and relate to higher perceived stress.
- Some fragmentation: slightly elevated intradaily heart‑rate/activity variability (Z ≈ 0.32) that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Behavioral patterns (high video‑game time, limited reading) could reflect stress‑related coping or lifestyle factors associated with elevated stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean)
- Severe subjective and objective sleep problems: PSQI = 10 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.46), very short median nightly sleep (~3 h 27 m) and high sleep‑duration variability (Z values indicate substantial deviation), which are established contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Very high intradaily variability (Z = 2.29) indicating fragmented rest–activity rhythms; this metric correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.24).
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale Z ≈ 0.94) could add psychosocial stress, albeit its correlation with PSS in this sample is small.

Comparative weighting within each study frame
- Strength of predictive associations: For Participant 2, key protective predictors (very low GAD‑7, Z ≈ -0.94; high NGSE, Z ≈ 0.49; low emotional lability, Z ≈ -1.67) have very strong sample‑level associations with PSS (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). Those strong associations favor substantially lower PSS for Participant 2 despite the severe sleep problems.
- For Participant 1, the strongest objective signals (high interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.9; low resting HR Z ≈ -1.18) are protective but their sample correlations with PSS are relatively small (e.g., r ≈ -0.11 to -0.17 for circadian metrics; RHR r ≈ 0.13). Subjective signals pointing to higher stress (low happiness, modest anxiety) are moderate predictors but generally weaker than the key predictors in Participant 2.
- Overall, Participant 2’s profile contains very large sleep‑related risks but also contains unusually strong protective psychological indicators (notably very low anxiety and high self‑efficacy) whose sample‑level correlations with PSS are large. Participant 1’s profile is mixed with protective physiological/circadian signs and weaker-to-moderate subjective risk signals; the net inference in the provided summary was “near to modestly below” the sample mean for Participant 1, whereas Participant 2’s summary more clearly leans below their sample mean because of the dominant low GAD‑7 and high NGSE.

Decision
- Balancing the direction and comparative strength of the indicators (especially the very strong inverse association of GAD‑7 and NGSE with PSS in Participant 2’s sample versus only moderate associations among Participant 1’s risk markers), Participant 1 plausibly exhibits the higher perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 11 (z ≈ 1.98, “Disturbed Sleep”), with PSQI known to correlate with PSS and here appearing strongly elevated relative to peers.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI‑Trait = 49; z ≈ 0.76), another self‑report correlate of perceived stress.
- Objective physiological signatures consistent with stress: elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.60), reduced amplitude and interdaily stability, and a pronounced morning heart‑rate surge (hourly deviation z ≈ 2.09) — together indicating circadian fragmentation and morning arousal patterns that in the dataset accompany higher PSS.
- Additional lifestyle/self‑report signals aligned with stress: high internet use (z ≈ 1.52) and lower reported happiness (z ≈ −0.53).
- The summary explicitly infers perceived stress above the population mean (mean = 21.61) and characterizes the elevation as moderate but real.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their description)
- Multiple self‑report measures that strongly predict PSS are elevated: mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 7.5; GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80), emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability = 6.33; r ≈ 0.67), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; r ≈ 0.59).
- Pain and functional interference are nontrivial (PEG‑3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55), both moderately correlated with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.47; PAPAS r ≈ 0.50).
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate deviations that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.45) suggest night‑time autonomic arousal linked to stress.
- The summary explicitly infers perceived stress above the population mean (mean = 20.75) based mainly on the strong predictive weight of the self‑report measures.

Comparative, within‑population-frame considerations
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, so the question is which appears relatively worse given each description relative to peers.
- Participant 1 presents with strongly elevated depressive symptomatology (CES‑D z ≈ 1.84) and more severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI 11, z ≈ 1.98). These are high‑magnitude deviations on measures directly tied to perceived stress and are described as convergent with physiological signs of circadian fragmentation.
- Participant 2’s strongest predictors of higher PSS are self‑report measures that have high correlations with PSS in the dataset (GAD‑7 and emotional lability), but the absolute symptom levels described (e.g., GAD‑7 = 7.5 described as “mild”) appear less extreme than Participant 1’s depressive and sleep elevations. Crucially, Participant 2 also shows several robust objective protective features (high circadian amplitude and 24‑h autocorrelation, long objective sleep time, consolidated daytime activation) that the description emphasizes as moderating the impact of self‑reported symptoms.
- In short: Participant 1 shows high‑magnitude adverse signals across mood and sleep plus objective fragmentation; Participant 2 shows multiple survey signals strongly associated with PSS but of milder absolute severity and substantially stronger physiological/resilience signals that likely attenuate perceived stress relative to peers.

Weighting the evidence and conclusion
- The balance of evidence favors Participant 1 having the higher overall perceived stress. Participant 1’s elevated depressive symptoms and very poor subjective sleep (both large z‑deviations) plus objective signs of circadian fragmentation are stronger and less offset by resiliency signals than Participant 2’s pattern, where strong predictor variables exist but are milder and coexist with pronounced objective circadian resilience.
- Therefore, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) PSS relative to their study populations.

- Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 6, above clinical cutpoint) and late/variable sleep timing (late median sleep start ≈ 00:57; night‑to‑night SD ≈ 63 min) that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity and activity fragmentation (interdaily stability Z = -0.74; intradaily variability Z = 0.32) and some early‑morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS.
- Lower recent happiness and health satisfaction (small negative Zs) that align with higher stress.
Overall note: these risk signals are generally small-to-moderate in magnitude and are counterbalanced by several strong protective factors, so the written inference was “near the mean, possibly slightly above.”

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean = 20.75)
- Strong self-report signals that highly correlate with PSS in this dataset: mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 7.5; correlation r ≈ 0.80), emotional lability (BASIS‑24 ~6.33; r ≈ 0.67), and poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; r ≈ 0.59).
- Pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) with moderate correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations at several late‑night hours that show moderate positive correlations with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.45).
- Although wearable circadian features are protective (high amplitude and 24‑h autocorrelation) and objective sleep time is long, the narrative emphasizes that the strongly predictive self‑report measures are likely to yield perceived stress above the sample mean. The self‑report predictors here have larger correlations with PSS than the modest predictors in Participant 1.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Strength of predictive signals: Participant 2’s principal risk indicators (anxiety, emotional lability, PSQI, pain) are both larger in magnitude and have much stronger correlations with PSS in that study (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80, Emotional Lability r ≈ 0.67, PSQI r ≈ 0.59) than Participant 1’s risk indicators (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES‑D r ≈ 0.28, PSQI weaker correlation here). This makes Participant 2’s inferred elevation above their mean more robust.
- Balance of risks vs. protections: Participant 1 has several strong protective features (high self‑esteem Z = 1.38, frequent exercise, low substance use, healthy physiology) that substantially offset their modest risk signals, producing only a small upward tilt relative to mean. Participant 2, by contrast, has wearable-based protective physiology, but those features are described as moderating rather than outweighing the strong self‑report signals that predict higher PSS.
- Certainty of inference: The narrative for Participant 1 explicitly hedges (“near the mean, possibly slightly above”), while the narrative for Participant 2 expresses a clearer inference that perceived stress is above the population mean. Given the strength and predictive weight of Participant 2’s self‑report measures, the evidence that Participant 2’s PSS is relatively higher is stronger and more decisive.

Conclusion
Based on the relative strength of risk indicators (especially the high‑weight self‑report predictors in Participant 2), and taking into account that each description is framed versus its own cohort mean, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6). GAD‑7 has the strongest positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.78), so even mild anxiety is a salient contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) and very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 273 min, z = 1.7). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.49); objective irregular sleep timing and low interdaily stability (z = -0.68) also track with higher stress.
- Pain-related interference (PEG ≈ 6.78; PAPAS z ≈ 0.24) which correlate positively with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.54), a modest contributor to stress.
- Overall the summary explicitly concludes the participant is probably slightly above their study mean PSS (21.04).

Protective factors noted (moderate self-efficacy, no substance problems, normal resting HR, long median sleep) temper but do not fully offset the stress‑linked signals—importantly, anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance are among the strongest predictors in this dataset.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 52 min, z = -0.4) and late habitual sleep onset (~01:07), which in some contexts can be associated with increased perceived stress or reduced recovery.
- Low levels of solo exercise and limited social time (social time very low), which could remove behavioral buffers against stress if persistent.

However, these are modest in magnitude and the participant’s description emphasizes multiple convergent indicators of lower stress (very low CES‑D, below‑mean trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and momentary happiness, high interdaily stability and autocorrelation, large HR amplitude, low resting HR). The report explicitly concludes the participant is below their study mean PSS (21.62).

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is described as likely slightly above their population mean (21.04). Participant 2 is described as below their population mean (21.62).
- The strongest single statistical driver reported is Participant 1’s anxiety measure (GAD‑7), which has a very high correlation with PSS (r = 0.78) in that sample—this gives substantial weight to the inference that Participant 1’s PSS is elevated relative to peers.
- Participant 2 shows multiple convergent low‑distress indicators (low CES‑D and STAI, high self‑esteem and happiness) and robust, regular circadian physiology; these point consistently toward lower perceived stress relative to their peers. The few risk signs for Participant 2 are relatively small and noted as having weak correlations with PSS in that dataset.
- Although population means differ slightly (21.04 vs 21.62), the relative positions reported (P1 > mean, P2 < mean) combined with the strength of P1’s anxiety predictor lead to the conclusion that Participant 1 likely has the higher perceived stress.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Participant 1: several moderate-to-strong stress‑linked signals (especially anxiety and subjective sleep problems) and explicit characterization as slightly above their sample mean.
- Participant 2: multiple, convergent indicators of lower stress and explicit characterization as below their sample mean; risk factors are modest and weakly related to PSS.

25,48013,21,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 19, Z = +0.59) — both are established, moderately strong positive predictors of PSS in that sample.
- Marked circadian dysregulation (interdaily stability Z ≈ −1.48; 24‑hr autocorr Z ≈ −1.54; amplitude Z ≈ −1.08) and notable night‑to‑night sleep timing/duration variability (sleep duration SD Z = +1.13; sleep start SD Z = +0.80) — objective patterns that in this sample are associated with higher perceived stress.
- Low subjective well‑being (happiness Z = −1.61; self‑esteem Z = −1.43), which add psychosocial weight toward higher perceived stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is most plausibly above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Elevated indicators that strongly correlate with PSS in that sample: mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6; GAD‑7 has very high correlation with PSS, r = 0.78) and poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13; r ≈ 0.49).
- Substantial objective sleep instability (sleep SD z = +1.7) and some circadian irregularity (interdaily stability z = −0.68), both linked to higher PSS.
- Pain interference (PEG ≈ 6.78) and interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = +0.54), which correlate positively with PSS.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is at or modestly above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.04).

Comparative weighing (taking each profile relative to its own population mean)
- Both participants are characterized as above their study means, but the magnitude and consistency of high‑stress indicators differ.
- Participant 1 shows several moderately-to-strong psychosocial risk markers (notably trait anxiety Z +1.35 and elevated depressive symptoms), more extreme objective circadian disruption (Z values near −1.5 for interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation), plus low subjective well‑being — a coherent cluster of risk features with fewer strong protective buffers (exercise is protective but has small correlation with PSS).
- Participant 2 presents strong single predictors in terms of correlation strength (GAD‑7 has very high r with PSS), and very high sleep variability (Z ≈ +1.7). However, several powerful protective factors are also present (notably self‑efficacy with r = −0.65 and no substance problems z = −1.62), and many risk indicators are characterized as “mild” or partly ambiguous (e.g., GAD‑7 = 6 is mild anxiety).
- On balance, Participant 1’s profile is more consistently aligned with elevated perceived stress across multiple domains (trait anxiety + depressive symptoms + objective circadian disruption + low well‑being), whereas Participant 2 shows a mix of strong predictors and strong buffers that produce a smaller net elevation above their mean.

14,98117,24,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated anxiety and emotional lability: GAD-7 = 10.5 (clinically meaningful) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +0.53; these self-report scales are strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (GAD-PSS corr ≈ 0.77; emotional lability corr ≈ 0.65).  
- Disturbed subjective sleep and pain interference: PSQI = 8.5 (above clinical cutoff) and PEG/PAPAS elevated (PEG mean 8.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +1.21), both moderately correlated with PSS.  
- Nocturnal/evening physiological arousal: overnight HR deviations around midnight–2am (Z ≈ +1.25–1.36) that are correlated with PSS in the sample (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD ≈ 199 min, Z ≈ +0.65) which contributes to stress in the sample.

Factors that moderate this: several protective/low-stress indicators relative to the sample (self-efficacy slightly above mean, strong circadian regularity metrics Z ≈ +0.58–+0.97, low resting HR Z ≈ −0.86, low substance problems Z ≈ −0.77). Overall the clinician summary judged Participant 1’s PSS as above the population mean, but many deviations are modest (most Zs < ~1.4) and there are clear resilience signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very large depressive symptom burden: CES-D = 33 (Z ≈ +2.05) and elevated trait anxiety STAI Z ≈ +1.16; both correlate positively with PSS.  
- Marked sleep disturbance and extreme sleep timing/duration irregularity: PSQI = 8, median sleep start ~04:03, sleep start SD = 280 min (Z ≈ +4.33), sleep duration SD = 234 min (Z ≈ +3.02). These are very large deviations from the sample mean and are associated with higher PSS.  
- Low social engagement and unhealthy behaviors: socializing ~15 min or less (Z ≈ −2.20), high recreational internet use (Z ≈ +2.19), minimal exercise — behavioral profile strongly associated with poorer mood/stress.  
- Wearable physiology also compatible with stress: elevated resting HR and mesor (Zs ≈ +0.96 to +0.98), slightly reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −0.42).

Factors that moderate this: no substance use (protective) and some circadian metrics near-average or less fragmented (intradaily variability Z ≈ −1.73, interdaily stability near mean), but these are smaller in magnitude than the large symptom and sleep irregularity signals. The study summary concluded Participant 2’s PSS is above their population mean, with multiple very large Z-scores.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Magnitude and number of deviations: Participant 2 shows multiple very large deviations (Zs > +2, notably sleep timing Z ≈ +4.33 and sleep SD Z ≈ +3.02, CES-D Z ≈ +2.05). Participant 1’s elevated indicators are generally more moderate (most Zs below ~1.4, except nocturnal HR ~1.25–1.36 and PAPAS Z ≈ +1.21).  
- Convergence across modalities: Participant 2 has a dense, convergent cluster of large self-report (depression, anxiety, PSQI) and behavioral (extreme sleep irregularity, low socializing, high internet use) signals that all point strongly toward higher perceived stress. Participant 1 has strong signals (notably anxiety and poor sleep) but also several substantive protective signals (circadian regularity, low resting HR, higher self-efficacy) that reduce the net weight of risk.  
- Directness/relevance to PSS: Both participants have measures that correlate with PSS, but Participant 2’s extremely elevated CES-D and extreme sleep irregularity are especially large and directly linked to higher PSS in the sample. Participant 1’s strongest single predictor (GAD-7) is predictive, but overall effect-size burden is smaller than Participant 2’s.

Weighted judgement
- Considering the number, magnitude (size of Z-scores), and cross-modal convergence of indicators, Participant 2 likely exhibits a higher perceived stress level relative to their study population than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.

14,57443,24,25,"Approach: I list plausible reasons each participant might show higher perceived stress (relative to their own study population), compare the strength and number of those indicators (taking reported correlations and z-scores into account), and then decide which participant likely has the higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have higher PSS
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 19; Z ≈ 0.59) and depression–PSS correlation in the sample (~0.28) suggest depressive symptoms that co-occur with higher perceived stress.  
- Some trait anxiety (STAI = 40) with STAI–PSS correlation ≈ 0.31 is consistent with some chronic anxiety proneness linked to higher PSS.  
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular tone (mesor Z = 0.85; RHR Z = 0.36) and small positive correlations between RHR/mesor and PSS (RHR r ≈ 0.14) point toward slightly higher physiological arousal.  
- Small nocturnal HR deviations correlated with PSS (3–6am deviations r ≈ 0.19–0.22) and small positive association of intradaily variability with PSS (r ≈ 0.16) could reflect minor stress-related disruption.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10.5) with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.77) — a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress in this dataset.  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale Z ≈ 0.53) that correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 8.5) with substantial correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.55) and large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD Z = 0.65).  
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z = 1.21) with moderate correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Marked nocturnal/evening heart-rate elevations (midnight–2am +13–14 bpm; Z ≈ 1.25–1.36) with fairly large correlations to PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), indicating substantial physiological arousal tied to higher PSS.

Comparative within-population reasoning
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s strongest survey predictors (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.65; PSQI r ≈ 0.55) show much larger associations with PSS than Participant 1’s predictors (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). The magnitude of these correlations implies that the same raw elevations in Participant 2 map to a larger expected increase in PSS than Participant 1’s elevations do within their respective samples.  
- Physiological evidence: Participant 2 shows large nocturnal HR elevations (Z > 1.2) tightly associated with PSS (r up to ~0.40). Participant 1 shows only modest HR/mesor elevations (mesor Z ≈ 0.85; RHR Z ≈ 0.36) and smaller nocturnal HR–PSS correlations (~0.19–0.22).  
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has multiple robust protective indicators (high interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.75; autocorr Z ≈ 1.15; very low sleep-duration variability Z ≈ -1.33; good PSQI relative to sample), which are each negatively associated with PSS and likely to meaningfully buffer perceived stress. Participant 2 has some protective features (self-efficacy slightly above average, circadian regularity metrics Z ≈ 0.58–0.97, low resting HR), but these appear weaker relative to the strong symptom signals (anxiety, poor sleep, pain) driving PSS upward.  
- Net balance: Participant 2’s set of high-impact predictors (clinically significant anxiety, disturbed sleep, emotional lability, pain, pronounced nocturnal HR) outweighs their protective signs and are more strongly associated with PSS than Participant 1’s more modest symptom signals, which are largely counterbalanced by strong protective circadian/sleep metrics.

Conclusion: Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

3,14571,13,12,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) and is a likely stress-related risk factor.  
- Pain-related interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) above median; pain measures moderately correlate with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).  
- Relatively elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which can reduce social support.  
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5) and modestly elevated physiological arousal (mesor and resting HR Z ≈ 1.2), both of which can accompany higher perceived stress.  
- Although there are strong protective factors, these targeted risk factors are plausibly stress-elevating for this individual.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high sedentary/screen time (large positive Zs for video games, TV, internet) and very low exercise frequency — behaviors that can reduce stress buffering and may increase vulnerability.  
- Low social-trust score (Z = -2.39), which could reflect reduced perceived support and contribute to stress.  
- Late median sleep start time (~01:04 AM) and modestly elevated heart-rate mesor/amplitude (mesor Z = 1.35; amplitude Z = 1.72) that could indicate some tonic arousal or scheduling/social strain.  
- These are risk factors, but their sample correlations with PSS are smaller and the participant also shows many strong protective signals.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.38; P2 mean = 21.64). The summaries conclude P1 is near or slightly below their population mean, while P2 is below their population mean and likely nearer the lower quartile.  
- Strength of protective vs. risk signals: Participant 2 shows very strong protective indicators (CES-D = 0, STAI-T = 20, high self-esteem and happiness, good PSQI, very high circadian regularity). These are highly consistent and large in magnitude.  
- Participant 1 shows a mixed picture: strong protective resources (high NGSE, robust circadian regularity, emotional stability) but also meaningful stress-relevant risks (poor subjective sleep, pain interference, interpersonal strain). The protective NGSE is a strong negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.63), but P1’s risk factors (especially PSQI and pain) are non-trivial and likely keep their inferred stress nearer the sample mean.  
- Overall balance: P2’s protective profile is stronger and more coherent than P1’s; P1 has more salient stress-relevant problems (sleep complaints, pain, interpersonal strain) despite some protections. Therefore P1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress relative to their respective peers.

3,62617,13,17,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Reduced interdaily stability of heart‑rate rhythm (Z = -1.73) and lower circadian amplitude (Z = -1.01) — these circadian irregularities have been associated with higher stress in population studies and represent a vulnerability.
- Evening HR elevations and small positive correlations between early‑morning HR deviations and PSS suggest episodic physiological arousal that could reflect stressors at certain times of day.
- These physiological signals are moderate in magnitude and thus could increase perceived stress for this individual under some conditions.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), making poor perceived sleep a substantive risk for higher PSS.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) are elevated and correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47), representing another credible source of increased perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54) may reduce social support and contribute to stress even if direct correlation with PSS is small.
- Elevated physiological baseline (mesor and resting HR Z ≈ 1.2 each) could reflect increased autonomic arousal associated with stress in some individuals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is stated relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is characterized as likely below the population mean PSS (mean = 21.63), driven by very low depression/anxiety, high happiness/self‑esteem, normative resting HR, long/consistent sleep, regular exercise, and low substance use. The physiological vulnerabilities (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, evening HR elevations) are moderate and described as insufficient to outweigh the strong protective psychosocial and sleep indicators.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the population mean PSS (mean = 21.38), with clear mixed signals: strong protective factors (very high self‑efficacy with a strong inverse correlation to PSS, excellent circadian regularity, low emotional lability) but notable risk factors (clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance, pain/interference, interpersonal strain, elevated resting HR). The report explicitly states the overall inference is near the sample mean, perhaps slightly below, rather than clearly below it.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: strong, convergent psychosocial and objective sleep indicators point to reliably lower perceived stress relative to their population mean. Physiological circadian irregularities are present but modest and interpreted as vulnerabilities rather than primary drivers of higher PSS.
- Participant 2: several meaningful risk factors for higher PSS (especially poor subjective sleep and pain/interference) are present and more directly linked to PSS in this sample, despite substantial protective buffering (high NGSE, strong circadian regularity). The integrated assessment places Participant 2 near the population mean (i.e., higher perceived stress than someone characterized as clearly below the mean).
- Therefore, relative to their respective study distributions, Participant 2’s inferred perceived stress is higher than Participant 1’s.

24,97596,33,32,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong subjective sleep complaints (PSQI Z = 3.83), which commonly co-occur with and amplify perceived stress.
- Clinically relevant depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 2.05) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.56), both positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Physiological signs consistent with greater arousal/fragmentation (mildly elevated resting HR Z = 0.65; intradaily variability Z = 0.81; some daytime HR deviations), which are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Low current happiness and below-average self-esteem consistent with profiles reporting higher stress.
- Protective factors (long, regular objective sleep, regular exercise, low substance use, social time, music use) may temper but do not eliminate the above risk signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very elevated generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z = 1.51) and this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.74) — the single strongest predictor described.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65; r with PSS = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63), increased pain/interference (PEG-3, PAPAS), and lower self-efficacy (NGSE; r = -0.66) — several high-effect-size subjective predictors that converge on higher PSS.
- Although objective physiology (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, low resting HR/mesor, clear cosinor amplitude) is relatively organized and protective, the subjective measures with larger effect sizes are emphasized in the description as driving above-mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective study means. The deciding factor is the relative strength of the indicators and their correlations with PSS in each sample.
- Participant 1 has very large subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 3.83) and notable depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 2.05). However, the reported correlations of those affective measures with PSS in Participant 1’s sample are modest (CES-D and STAI r ≈ 0.27–0.31), and several protective behaviors and objectively long, regular sleep are noted.
- Participant 2 presents multiple subjective indicators that are not only elevated but also have large sample-level associations with PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.74; BASIS-24 r = 0.63; NGSE r = -0.66). Even though objective physiology is relatively protective, the self-report measures that most strongly predict PSS are markedly elevated, and the summary explicitly weights these as carrying greater predictive value.
- Because Participant 2’s elevated self-report predictors are both large in magnitude (Z-scores) and have much stronger correlations with PSS in that study than the analogous predictors do in Participant 1’s study, the balance of predictive evidence indicates a larger above-mean deviation in PSS for Participant 2.

20,35011,21,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Strong self-report risk signals that are highly correlated with PSS in the cohort:
  - Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10), which in this sample correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.77).
  - High emotional lability (BASIS‑24 emotional lability = 9; r ≈ 0.66).
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r ≈ 0.49) and very short median sleep (≈3 h 55 min).
  - High pain and pain-related interference (PEG‑3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86; correlations ≈ 0.45–0.49).
- Circadian/sleep wearable signals point toward blunted rhythms (amplitude Z ≈ −1.51, interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.75) and a compressed/shifted diurnal heart‑rate profile—features modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Although there are protective signals (high general self‑efficacy NGSE Z ≈ +1.41, which is strongly negatively correlated with PSS r ≈ −0.68; low interpersonal difficulty; lower resting HR), the most potent risk indicators (anxiety, emotional lability, severe subjective sleep disturbance, pain) have large associations with PSS and are noticeably elevated for this participant.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Prominent objective physiological/circadian disruption:
  - Very high resting HR (Z ≈ +2.31) and markedly reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −2.10), very low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.98) and low autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.62). These indicate damped/irregular autonomic and daily rhythms.
  - These HR/circadian metrics do associate with PSS in the cohort, but their correlations are modest (≈ 0.15–0.2).
- Sleep problems: PSQI >5 (PSQI = 7), short median sleep (≈6 h 5 min, Z ≈ −1.37), and very late sleep onset (~02:34).
- Behavioral and mood risk factors: low exercise, limited socializing, low physical health satisfaction (Z ≈ −1.78), slightly elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 20, Z ≈ +0.7; CES‑D–PSS correlation ≈ +0.29).
- Some protective signals: lower trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ −0.52), higher self‑esteem (Z ≈ +0.96), above‑average happiness (Z ≈ +0.55), no drug use—these moderate the inferred stress level.
- Overall, the participant shows multiple objective and behavioral indices of stress, but many of those indices have only modest direct correlations with PSS in this sample.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Strength and directness of predictors: Participant 1’s highest-risk indicators (GAD‑7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain measures) are both pronounced and have large correlations with PSS in that cohort (r values up to ~0.77). That gives strong, direct evidence that this participant’s perceived stress is substantially above their study mean.
- Participant 2 shows very large Z‑scores on physiological/circadian metrics (amplitude, interdaily stability, resting HR), but in this dataset those objective circadian/autonomic markers have only modest correlations with PSS. Their depressive symptoms and behavioral risk factors support above‑mean PSS but are of more moderate magnitude than Participant 1’s strongest signals.
- Protective factors are present for both. Participant 1’s strong self‑efficacy is an important buffer (r ≈ −0.68) but does not fully counterbalance multiple very strong risk indicators (anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability). Participant 2’s protective self‑report (lower trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem, greater happiness) mitigate some risk from circadian/autonomic disruption.

Decision (which participant likely has the higher PSS)
- Considering the relative magnitudes of risk indicators and their correlations with PSS within each study, Participant 1’s profile contains several high‑impact predictors of perceived stress (notably anxiety and emotional lability with very large cohort correlations, plus extremely poor subjective sleep and pain). Although Participant 2 has severe circadian/physiologic disruption, those metrics are less strongly tied to PSS in the sample than Participant 1’s top self-report predictors.
- Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

20,46418,21,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean):
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11; z ≈ 1.98). PSQI correlates positively with PSS, so this is a fairly strong self-report signal toward higher perceived stress.  
- Modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 18; z ≈ 0.49), and CES-D has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Lower self-rated physical health satisfaction (z ≈ −1.2) could increase subjective strain and tendency to report more stress.  
- Large evening heart-rate deviations (e.g., +26 bpm at 5–6 pm; z ≈ 2.27) could reflect time-specific physiological activation related to stress or stressful activities.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not elevated) PSS:
- Strong objective protective signals: well-organized circadian rhythms (high interdaily stability z ≈ +1.0; high cosinor amplitude z ≈ +1.39; low intradaily variability z ≈ −1.73) that correlate modestly with lower PSS.  
- Adequate and regular objective sleep (median ~7 h 44 m; z ≈ +0.69; low night-to-night variability), which is protective.  
- Favorable behavioral health (frequent group exercise, social/leisure engagement) and low–normal resting HR.  
- Trait anxiety and self-esteem not elevated (STAI z ≈ −0.33; RSES z ≈ −0.03), reducing likelihood of a high PSS.

Overall for Participant 1: risk signals are mainly subjective (PSQI, modest CES-D, health satisfaction) and of moderate magnitude; objective physiological and behavioral signals are relatively strong and protective. The original synthesis judged P1 near the population mean (21.61).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean):
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10), noted as clinically meaningful and strongly correlated with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.77). This is a very strong predictor of higher PSS.  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5) with a moderate-to-strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86), which correlate moderately with PSS (~0.45–0.49).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9; correlation with PSS ≈ 0.66) — another strong positive predictor.  
- Objective sleep/circadian markers that align with risk: very short recorded sleep (median ≈ 3 h 55 m) and blunted circadian amplitude (z ≈ −1.51) and low interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.75), all of which modestly associate with higher PSS.  
- Hourly HR deviations indicating a compressed/shifted rest-activity profile consistent with stress-related dysregulation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or not elevated) PSS:
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +1.41) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ −0.68), which is a substantial protective factor.  
- Low interpersonal difficulties (BASIS-24 interpersonal score z ≈ −1.27), which tends to reduce PSS.  
- Lower resting HR and mesor (z ≈ −0.9 and −1.4) suggesting lower tonic physiological arousal or good fitness, modestly protective.

Overall for Participant 2: multiple strong self-report predictors of higher PSS are present (especially anxiety, emotional lability, poor subjective sleep, pain), many of which have large correlations with PSS in this sample. Protective factors (self-efficacy, low interpersonal problems, low resting HR) attenuate risk but do not outweigh several high-weight predictors. The original synthesis judged P2 above the population mean (21.04).

Comparative weighing (within each participant’s population frame):
- Strength and number of high-weight predictors: Participant 2 shows multiple, large-effect self-report predictors strongly tied to PSS in that cohort (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; PSQI r ≈ 0.49; pain measures r ≈ 0.45–0.49). Participant 1’s strongest self-report risk is PSQI (z ≈ 1.98) and a modest CES-D elevation (r for CES-D → PSS ≈ 0.28).  
- Objective signals: Participant 1’s objective wearable and behavioral data are broadly protective (regular sleep, strong circadian rhythm, frequent exercise), whereas Participant 2’s wearable signals show disturbed sleep and blunted/irregular circadian rhythms.  
- Net balance: Participant 1 presents a mixed profile but with substantial objective protective evidence leading to an inference near the population mean. Participant 2 presents multiple converging, strongly weighted indicators of elevated perceived stress that the protective factors are unlikely to fully offset.

Conclusion:
Based on the number, magnitude, and direction of predictors (and their cohort correlations), Participant 2 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Elevated resting HR and mesor (resting HR 79.8 bpm, Z ≈ 1.53; mesor Z ≈ 1.49), indicating sustained physiological arousal consistent with higher stress.
- Emotional/functional disturbance (BASIS‑24 elevations, some substance-related items) that align with higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is assessed as near the population mean and leaning slightly below it; protective signals (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, regular exercise, adequate and regular objective sleep, low resting HR) outweigh the stress-related signals (circadian fragmentation, evening HR spikes, subjective poor sleep).
- Participant 2 is assessed as clearly above the population mean; multiple high-weight indicators (severe anxiety, very poor PSQI, low self-efficacy, pain interference, elevated resting HR, very short/irregular sleep) converge to indicate substantially elevated perceived stress relative to their study population.
- Because each description is already interpreted relative to its own population mean, comparing those relative positions shows Participant 2 is meaningfully above their sample mean while Participant 1 is at-or-slightly-below theirs.

17,22842,19,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = 1.25) — in this study GAD‑7 is strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.81), making this a high-weight indicator of elevated perceived stress.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83) and concordant wearable indicators of short, late, and irregular sleep (median wearable sleep 2 h 31 min, late median sleep start, high sleep-start variability). Poor sleep quality is correlated with higher PSS (PSQI r = 0.51).
- Low generalized self-efficacy (NGSE = 27.0; Z = -0.62), which is a substantial inverse correlate of PSS in this sample (r = -0.66).
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS moderate; correlations with PSS ~0.44–0.48), adding psychosocial strain.
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone (resting HR Z = 1.53; mesor Z = 1.49), consistent with sustained physiological arousal linked to stress.
- While some circadian regularity and preserved diurnal pattern are present (protective), they are described as modest and do not outweigh multiple strong stress indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 20; Z ≈ 0.7) and trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z ≈ 0.46); both correlate positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), but these correlations are moderate, not as strong as Participant 1’s GAD‑7→PSS link.
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52) and late, highly variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:56, sleep-start SD Z = 1.79) plus a high mean daily nap rate (Z = 2.4) — these behavioral markers point toward sleep/circadian dysregulation associated with higher stress.
- Wearable circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.9), consistent with weaker day-to-day regularity associated with higher stress.
- However, there are several mitigating/protective features: relatively long median nocturnal sleep (7 h 51 m; Z = 0.83), frequent exercise (Z = 1.07), low substance use, moderate health satisfaction (Z = 0.88), and relatively low resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ −0.47 to −0.63) — these can reduce perceived stress or buffer its impact.

Comparative, within-population considerations
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective study means. The comparison needs to account for magnitude of signals (Z-scores) and the strength of association of each feature with PSS in its study.
- Participant 1’s profile includes multiple high-weight indicators strongly associated with PSS in that sample: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 with very high correlation to PSS), markedly poor subjective sleep, low self-efficacy (strong inverse correlate), pain/interference, and elevated resting HR. Several of these indicators have large effect-size correlations with PSS in that study (notably GAD‑7 and NGSE).
- Participant 2 also shows clear stress-related signals (depression, elevated trait anxiety, poor subjective sleep, late/variable sleep timing, very high nap rate), but many of these measures are either only moderately correlated with PSS in that sample (CES‑D, STAI) or are partially offset by robust protective features (objectively adequate sleep duration, regular exercise, low resting HR, health satisfaction).
- The net evidence for Participant 1 is more concentrated in high-weight, strongly PSS‑linked measures (especially the severe anxiety score and low self‑efficacy), whereas Participant 2’s indicators are a mix of moderate-risk signals and notable protective factors.

Overall balance and decision
Given the severity and high-PSS predictive weight of Participant 1’s anxiety, poor sleep (both subjective and wearable-supported), low self‑efficacy, pain-related interference, and elevated resting HR — and given that Participant 2’s stress signals are more moderate and substantially buffered by protective behaviors and physiological indicators — Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

11,63138,24,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their population frame)
- Elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (IV, Z = +1.16). In this sample IV has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), so greater fragmentation could reflect higher perceived stress.
- Modestly elevated resting heart rate and mesor (RHR Z ≈ +0.56; mesor Z ≈ +0.44). Both have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14 and 0.06), consistent with mild baseline arousal.
- Late habitual sleep timing (median ~01:37). While timing itself is not strongly tied to PSS here, late timing combined with physiological fragmentation can indicate circadian misalignment that is associated with stress-related dysregulation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their population frame)
- Severe self-reported anxiety (GAD-7 = 16; z = +1.16) — this measure has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.78).
- High subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15; z ≈ +0.5) and extremely short wearable-recorded sleep (median ~2 h 58 m; z ≈ −0.82) with very late sleep onset (~02:23) — these sleep measures and nocturnal arousal strongly relate to higher PSS.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 z ≈ +1.18) and emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ +1.23), both positively associated with PSS.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −1.55), which correlates strongly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.66), indicating fewer coping resources.
- Wearable circadian disruption: high intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.3), low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude (z ≈ −1.4), and marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.40). These physiological signs converge with self-report to indicate elevated perceived stress.

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Strength and convergence of indicators: Participant 2 shows multiple, convergent signals (strongly elevated anxiety, poor sleep, low self-efficacy, emotional lability, and corroborating wearable circadian/physiological disruption). Several of these predictors have large correlations with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 and NGSE), giving substantial weight to the inference of above-mean PSS.
- In contrast, Participant 1’s psychosocial and behavioral indicators (low depressive symptoms, near-average anxiety, high happiness and health satisfaction, long consistent sleep, high circadian amplitude) point toward PSS near or slightly below their study mean. The signals consistent with higher stress for Participant 1 (IV, modestly elevated RHR/mesor, late sleep timing) are weaker predictors in that sample (small correlations) and fewer in number.
- Overall evidence balance: Participant 2’s profile is both stronger (higher z-scores on key predictors) and more internally consistent across self-report and wearable physiology than Participant 1’s mixed profile, where protective psychosocial/sleep indicators outweigh modest physiological signs of strain.

- Marked objective sleep/circadian disruption that aligns with stress: extremely short median sleep (≈2 h 58 m; z ≈ -0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.3), low amplitude (z ≈ -1.4), and low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.4). These physiological markers are typically associated with elevated perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 1–2am z ≈ 1.18) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40), consistent with hyperarousal during sleep.
- Multiple, mutually reinforcing signals (high anxiety, sleep disturbance, physiological arousal, low coping resources) point toward PSS above the study mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some self-report indicators modestly elevated and correlated with PSS: trait anxiety (STAI = 42, z ≈ 0.07), CES-D = 15 (z ≈ 0.18), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, z ≈ 0.59).
- Wearable circadian markers consistent with stress-related patterns: elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.60), reduced amplitude (z ≈ -0.72), and daytime HR peaks—each has a positive/expected link to higher PSS (though correlations are small-to-modest).
- Behavioral/contextual contributors (reduced reported happiness and lower socializing) that can push perceived stress slightly upward.
- However, these upward signals are modest and counterbalanced by protective features (adequate objective sleep ~7 h 18 m, frequent exercise, low resting HR, modest interdaily stability), so the overall inference in the description is “near the mean with a slight tilt upward,” not clearly high.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participant summaries are written relative to their own sample means. Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean PSS, driven by multiple strong indicators with moderate-to-large correlations with PSS (severe anxiety, extreme short/late sleep, nocturnal HR arousal, low self-efficacy). The physiological abnormalities are relatively extreme (e.g., sleep <3 hours, high intradaily variability, low amplitude) and some nocturnal HR deviations show meaningful correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the population mean with only modest upward risk signals (small z-scores on anxiety/depression, PSQI modestly elevated, intradaily variability and reduced amplitude modest). Importantly, Participant 2 also has several protective features (adequate objective sleep duration, frequent exercise, low resting HR) that substantially moderate the inferred PSS.
- Taking the strength and convergence of indicators into account (magnitude of z-scores, number of domains implicated, and presence of physiological corroboration tied to PSS), Participant 1’s profile indicates a more severe and coherent elevation in perceived stress relative to their peers than Participant 2’s profile does relative to theirs.

18,37218,18,14,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety strongly linked to PSS: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = +0.9) and sample correlation with PSS is very high (r = 0.80).  
- Marked objective sleep pathology: extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 min) with very late and highly variable sleep onset; PSQI = 13 (“disturbed sleep”). Sleep metrics and variability are known to co-occur with higher PSS in this sample.  
- Physiological arousal and circadian disruption: high resting heart rate (RHR Z = +1.67), low circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z = +1.23), and clear nocturnal HR elevations (12–2 AM) that have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42). These objective signals converge with the self-report indicators.  
- Elevated emotional lability and pain-related interference (BASIS-24, PEG-3) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Protective factor present but modest: somewhat higher self-efficacy (Z = +0.12) which negatively correlates with PSS but appears insufficient to offset multiple strong risk signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 24 (Z ≈ +1.11), STAI-trait = 49 (Z ≈ +0.76). Both correlate positively with PSS, though their sample-level correlations are modest (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32).  
- Subjective and objective sleep concerns: PSQI = 10 (Z ≈ +1.52), median sleep ~6 h 1 min (Z ≈ -1.45), very late median sleep start (~03:56 AM) and ~74 min variability; these features align with higher PSS.  
- Some circadian/physiological signs of strain: reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63), slight intradaily fragmentation, and late-night HR elevations. Lack of regular exercise/inactivity is another risk factor.  
- Protective/mitigating factors: no substance use, strong GPA, some interdaily stability (Z ≈ +0.58), social/leisure engagement — these reduce the likelihood that stress is extreme.

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Strength and specificity of associations: Participant 1’s anxiety measure (GAD-7) not only is elevated but has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.80), providing a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress within that cohort. Participant 2’s affective indicators (CES-D, STAI) are meaningfully elevated but have only moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.29–0.32).  
- Objective physiological severity: Participant 1 shows more extreme objective disturbance (very high RHR Z = +1.67, markedly reduced circadian amplitude Z = -1.57, low interdaily stability, nocturnal HR spikes) that are tied to PSS in the sample. Participant 2 shows modest physiologic deviations (RHR/mesor Z ≈ +0.3, amplitude Z ≈ -0.63) and some preserved circadian stability (interdaily stability Z ≈ +0.58).  
- Sleep metrics: both participants have disturbed sleep relative to their samples, but Participant 1’s objective sleep loss (median ~2.3 h/night) and high variability are far more extreme than Participant 2’s shorter-but-not-severely-reduced sleep (~6 h/night).  
- Protective features: Participant 2 has stronger behavioral/functional protective signals (no substance use, good GPA, some daily structure) that mitigate inferred stress; Participant 1’s main protective signal is only a modestly higher self-efficacy.

Overall judgment
Although both participants are inferred to be above their respective population mean PSS scores, the balance of evidence — particularly the combination of very high anxiety with a very strong PSS correlation, extreme objective sleep deprivation/variability, pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal, and circadian disruption — indicates that Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

18,79834,18,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (above clinical cutoff) indicating perceived poor sleep despite long objective sleep.
- Late sleep timing/social isolation indicators: median sleep onset ~00:46, low exercise and low engagement in leisure/social activities — fewer behavioral buffers against stress.
- Low interpersonal trust (z ≈ -1.42), which can amplify perceived stress.
- Elevated alcohol use (wine/liquor 3+ times/week, z = 1.68) that could reflect coping behavior tied to stress.
- Mismatch of subjective vs objective sleep (good objective duration but poor subjective quality) — subjective complaints often track PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- High anxiety: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) and GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.80).
- Severe sleep problems: PSQI = 13 and objectively extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 m, z = -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep timing — both linked to higher PSS.
- Physiological arousal and rhythm disruption: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm, z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (z = -1.57), low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability — all associated with greater stress.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations correlated with PSS (notably +8–9 bpm around midnight–2 AM).
- Elevated emotional lability and pain/interference measures that correlate positively with PSS.
- (Countervailing factor) Modestly higher self-efficacy (Z ≈ 0.12), but described as insufficient to offset the strong anxiety/sleep/rhythm signals.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each description is expressed relative to its own study mean (PSS means: 21.62 for Participant 1’s study; 21.17 for Participant 2’s study). Those means are very similar, so comparing relative positions is reasonable.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are physiological and symptom-scale indicators of lower stress (low resting HR, robust circadian metrics, low CES-D/STAI-T), with only moderate behavioral/subjective flags (PSQI = 6, late bedtime, low trust). The study-level interpretation was that their PSS is likely below their population mean.
- Participant 2 presents multiple strong, converging indicators tied to higher PSS in their cohort: high anxiety with a very strong sample-level correlation to PSS, severe objective and subjective sleep disruption, nocturnal physiological arousal correlated with PSS, and elevated emotional lability/pain. The study-level interpretation was that their PSS is likely above their population mean.
- The strength and number of Participant 2’s markers that are both large in magnitude and strongly correlated with PSS (especially GAD-7 and sleep disruption) outweigh Participant 1’s weaker/limited signals suggesting elevated stress (mainly subjective sleep and lifestyle factors). Participant 1’s dominant signals point to below-mean stress, whereas Participant 2’s dominant signals point to above-mean stress.

Balance-of-evidence conclusion
Participant 2 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (classified as “disturbed sleep”; z ≈ +0.59). Poor subjective sleep is associated with higher PSS even when objective sleep duration is adequate.  
- Episodic physiological arousal: elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (0.68, z ≈ +0.95) suggesting within-day fragmentation related modestly to PSS (r ≈ 0.17).  
- Pronounced hourly HR peaks: large positive HR deviations around midday and late evening (z ≈ 2.1–3.14) that have weak positive correlations with PSS in the sample.  
- Lower momentary positive affect: Happy score = 3 (z ≈ -0.53), and lower positive affect correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ -0.20).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Severe subjective and objective sleep problems: PSQI = 11.5 (z substantially positive; r with PSS ≈ 0.48) and median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 30 min with very late sleep onset (~03:37 AM). These are large abnormalities strongly linked to higher PSS.  
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33 and PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43; both scales show moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5), supporting higher perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: nighttime/early-morning HR elevations (e.g., 11 PM–2 AM windows with z up to ~0.67) that correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.43).  
- Reduced circadian robustness: lowered amplitude (Z ≈ -0.34) and reduced 24-h autocorrelation—features associated with higher stress in the sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Magnitude and directional consistency: Participant 2 shows multiple, large, concordant risk signals (very short objective sleep, high PSQI, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations, shifted sleep timing) that in this cohort have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS. Those abnormalities are substantial deviations from the cohort mean and point consistently toward higher perceived stress.  
- Participant 1’s risk signals are smaller and less consistent: subjective sleep complaint and some intraday HR fragmentation/peaks exist, but trait inventories (CES-D, STAI-Trait), high self-esteem, long and regular objective sleep, low resting HR, and above-average circadian stability are strong protective indicators. Many wearable–PSS correlations cited for Participant 1 are modest, and the protective signals are both numerous and sizable (notably very low depression/anxiety z-scores and high sleep duration z).  
- Correlation strengths matter: Several of Participant 2’s elevated measures (sleep disturbance, pain, nocturnal HR) have moderate-to-strong sample-level correlations with PSS, increasing confidence that these features imply elevated perceived stress. Participant 1’s elevated features have weaker sample correlations and are outweighed by robust protective markers.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Overall, Participant 2 presents a stronger, more consistent, and more strongly PSS-linked set of abnormalities than Participant 1, whose deviations are smaller and counterbalanced by multiple strong protective indicators. Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) relative to their respective study population.

1,52302,17,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong sleep-related risk signals that correlate moderately-to-strongly with PSS in the sample: very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5), objectively very short median sleep (~3 h 30 min), very late sleep onset (~03:37 AM).  
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) — pain scales have moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: nighttime/early-morning HR elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian amplitude/autocorrelation (amplitude Z ≈ −0.34; reduced 24h autocorr) — these wearable features are associated with higher PSS (night HR r up to ≈ 0.43).  
- Convergence of several independent PSS-relevant signals (subjective sleep, objective sleep restriction, pain, nocturnal HR) produces a coherent risk profile that the summary explicitly interprets as “above the population mean.”

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some modest risk indicators: trait anxiety slightly above sample mean (STAI–Trait = 43, Z ≈ +0.17) and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6); both correlate positively with PSS (trait anxiety r ≈ 0.31; PSQI commonly correlates with PSS).  
- Sleep timing/regularity variability: moderate night-to-night variability in sleep start and duration (Z ≈ 0.43–0.51), and a relatively late median sleep start (~01:07), which can be associated with stress or schedule strain.  
- Some behavioral factors that weakly favor stress: relatively low exercise frequency.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is anchored to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.21; P2 mean = 21.62). Both population means are very similar, so absolute mean differences do not alter the relative comparison; we must rely on how each participant deviates from their respective cohorts.  
- Participant 1 shows multiple moderate-to-strong PSS-linked abnormalities (very high PSQI, extreme objective sleep restriction, meaningful pain elevation, nocturnal HR elevations and blunted circadian robustness). Many of these features have moderate sample correlations with PSS and they converge on the same direction (greater stress). Although P1 has strong protective self-report signals (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability), the summary rates the balance as “above the population mean” because the physiological and sleep/pain signals are large and concordant.  
- Participant 2 presents a mixed but largely resilient profile: only modest elevations in trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance, but several substantial protective features (objectively long sleep duration Z ≈ +1.14, low resting HR Z ≈ −0.67, high circadian amplitude Z ≈ +0.50, low intradaily variability Z ≈ −0.95, low depression, high social time). The net interpretation in the summary is “near the population mean” (with some lean toward resilience/protection).  
- Magnitude and coherence matter: P1’s deviations in sleep duration and pain are large and physiologically corroborated by nocturnal HR disruption; P2’s risk signals are smaller in magnitude and are counterbalanced by multiple, relatively strong physiological and psychosocial protective signals.

Overall balance and decision
- Given the larger, concordant, and PSS-relevant abnormalities in Participant 1 (notably extreme objective sleep restriction, severe subjective sleep disturbance, elevated pain, and nocturnal physiological arousal) versus Participant 2’s modest vulnerability signals that are largely offset by robust protective markers, Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher perceived stress relative to their respective study population.

- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93) — also correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62) — NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.69), so this is a potent predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ +0.6–0.7) and notable nocturnal HR elevations (Zs up to ≈ +1.38) — nocturnal HR deviations correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83), indicating irregular day-to-day timing, which in this dataset trends with higher PSS.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05) — linked to higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T 44; Z ≈ +0.27) and lower happiness/health satisfaction.
- Later, shorter, and more variable sleep (median ≈ 6 h 51 min; sleep start ~00:59; sleep-start SD ≈ 89 min).
- High evening internet use (>4 hours; Z ≈ +2.19) and modestly elevated resting HR/mesor (Z ≈ +0.74–0.79), both potentially associated with greater perceived stress.

Comparative framing within each study population
- Both summaries conclude each participant’s profile is most consistent with PSS above their respective study mean (P1 mean = 21.29; P2 mean = 21.64). Thus both are interpreted as showing elevated perceived stress relative to peers.
- Important: strength of predictors differs. For Participant 1, several of the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (NGSE with r ≈ −0.69; PSQI and PAPAS with r ≈ 0.53) are present and point toward higher stress. For Participant 2, the clearest strong signal is subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.05); other stress-related signals (trait anxiety, elevated HR, late/variable sleep, heavy evening internet use) are present but some have smaller sample correlations with PSS or are partially offset by protective factors.
- Protective/mitigating signals differ: Participant 1’s main mitigator is relatively low GAD-7 (Z ≈ −0.76) and long median sleep duration, but Participant 1 lacks strong day-to-day circadian regularity and shows substantial pain and low self-efficacy. Participant 2 has stronger protective signals (high interdaily stability Z ≈ +0.83, low depressive symptoms, maintained academic/social functioning) that plausibly offset their stress-related behaviors.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 shows multiple, moderately-to-strongly weighted predictors that are known in this sample to be associated with higher PSS (notably low self-efficacy, high pain interference, poor subjective sleep, and nocturnal HR elevations). These predictors have substantive sample-level correlations with PSS and cohere toward a moderately elevated stress inference.
- Participant 2 has several stress-linked features (PSQI, late/short sleep, high evening internet use, modestly elevated HR), but these are counterbalanced by robust protective features (good interdaily stability, low depressive symptoms, regular functioning). Several of Participant 2’s stress signals either have smaller sample correlations with PSS or are offset by clear protective markers.
- On balance, the weight and quality of P1’s stress-relevant indicators (including predictors with stronger sample-level associations to PSS) make it more likely that Participant 1’s perceived stress is higher relative to their population mean than Participant 2’s is relative to theirs.

- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), and NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.69), so this would be expected to raise perceived stress.
- Physiological markers that align with higher PSS in the cohort: elevated mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and notable nocturnal HR deviations (midnight–early morning hourly Zs ≥ 0.55–1.38) — these HR features show moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83), a sign of less regular daily timing that is modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Integrated interpretation in the description explicitly concludes this participant is likely above the study mean (population mean = 21.29).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (as described)
- Some small-to-modest risk indicators are present: elevated nap frequency (0.25 naps/day; Z = 2.07), somewhat greater sleep-duration variability (SD z ≈ 0.67), slightly elevated intradaily variability (IV z ≈ 0.17), limited socializing time (z ≈ -1.41), elevated evening heart-rate deviations (hourly z up to ~2.37), and higher daily internet use (z ≈ 1.52). These features have small positive correlations with PSS in that cohort (e.g., nap frequency r ≈ 0.15; internet use r ≈ 0.11).
- However, most of these associations to PSS are weak in the Participant 2 dataset, and several could reflect non-stress causes (e.g., low resting HR reflecting fitness rather than low stress).

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is scaled to its own cohort mean PSS. Participant 1 is described as likely above their cohort mean (21.29) based on multiple moderate-to-strong contributors (sleep, pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR elevations) that, in that sample, have moderate correlations with PSS (many r ≈ 0.3–0.7).
- Participant 2 is described as likely below their cohort mean (21.62). The strongest signals for Participant 2 point toward lower stress: very low resting HR and mesor (large negative z-scores, likely fitness-related), very good PSQI (z ≈ -1.72), low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, long nightly sleep (z ≈ 1.49), high health satisfaction (z ≈ 1.71), and reasonably regular circadian measures. The features that could indicate higher stress are smaller in magnitude and have weak correlations with PSS in that study.
- Relative magnitudes and correlation strengths favor Participant 1 having higher perceived stress: Participant 1 shows several moderate-to-strong indicators that are directly and meaningfully associated with higher PSS in that cohort, whereas Participant 2 shows strong protective signals and only small, weakly PSS-associated risk signals.

23,87328,17,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Late sleep timing and increased nap rate: median sleep start ~01:26 AM and nap rate Z = 1.21; these are weakly correlated with higher PSS in the dataset.
- Pronounced evening HR elevation (peak deviation at 6–7 PM; Z ≈ 2.62), which could reflect sustained arousal and has modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.20), a weak correlate that can contribute to higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly short objective sleep: median ~4 h 21 min, a strong behavioral stressor linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Substantially poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically significant) with a moderate correlation to PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Large nocturnal heart‑rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (+11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z-scores >1) and the 1–2 AM deviation has a moderately strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46), indicating nocturnal physiological arousal strongly tied to higher PSS.
- High variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), which is associated with elevated stress in many contexts.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both summaries conclude each participant is likely below their study population mean PSS, but that inference is probabilistic and based on a balance of risk vs protective signals within each sample.
- Participant 1’s risk signals are relatively modest: a borderline PSQI, late timing/naps, and evening HR elevation. These features have weak-to-modest correlations with PSS in that sample. Countervailing evidence (very low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR, strong social time) are numerous and strong, driving the overall below-mean inference.
- Participant 2’s profile is more mixed but contains more severe sleep-related stress indicators that are both large in magnitude and more strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (very short objective sleep, high PSQI, sizable midnight–2 AM HR elevations). Although Participant 2 also has strong protective trait signals (very low GAD-7 and high self-efficacy), those protective signals coexist with sleep metrics that are plausibly sufficient to elevate perceived stress and are more directly tied to PSS by moderate correlations.
- The population mean PSS values are nearly identical (21.63 vs 21.21), so differences in absolute baseline do not materially bias the comparison; we should therefore focus on the relative strength and directness of stress-linked signals in each participant’s profile.

Overall judgment
- Although both participants are inferred (by their study reports) to be likely below their respective population mean PSS, Participant 2 presents substantially stronger, higher-magnitude sleep-related risk signals that are more directly and more strongly correlated with PSS in their sample (very short sleep duration, high PSQI, and nocturnal HR elevations). Participant 1’s risk signals are weaker and outweighed by multiple robust protective indicators (very low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem, strong circadian amplitude, low resting HR, high social time).
- Therefore, Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (i.e., a higher PSS score) when comparing these two profiles within their respective study frames.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 45; Z = +0.37), a robust positive correlate of PSS in the sample.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) plus late sleep onset (median 01:28), moderately short sleep (6 h 49 min, Z = -0.46) and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 151 min, Z = +1.14) — all features that tend to increase perceived stress.  
- Low reported exercise and limited socializing (Zs ≈ -1.9, -1.6, -1.41), which reduce stress-buffering behaviors.  
- Some nocturnal HR patterning (large early-morning negative deviations) and other physiological features that could reflect disturbed sleep physiology linked to higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5) and extremely short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) — severe sleep restriction is a strong behavioral stressor.  
- Large variability in sleep timing (start SD ≈ 123 min) and marked overnight HR elevations around midnight–2 AM (z > 1; 1–2 AM deviation correlates r ≈ 0.46 with PSS), consistent with nocturnal arousal associated with higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each profile is already interpreted relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as close to the study mean PSS (mean = 21.62) with a modest tendency toward being above it, whereas Participant 2 is inferred to be below their study mean PSS (mean = 21.21).  
- For Participant 1 the strongest risk signals are moderate (trait anxiety, sleep complaints) but are offset by several protective, strongly regular circadian/behavioral signals (high amplitude autocorrelation, interdaily stability, good self-esteem, low substance use). The summary explicitly states a net position near the sample mean with only modest elevation.  
- For Participant 2, although sleep disruption is severe objectively and subjectively, the most strongly PSS-predictive signals (very low GAD-7, relatively high self-efficacy, strong interdaily stability and low daytime physiological arousal) are judged in the summary to outweigh the sleep-related risks, leading to an inference of below-mean perceived stress. The reported correlations (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77, NGSE r ≈ -0.65) suggest these protective trait measures are heavily weighted in the study’s inference model relative to the sleep metrics (PSQI r ≈ 0.48, HR dev r ≈ 0.46).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: inferred near/ modestly above mean PSS (i.e., average-to-somewhat-higher stress for their cohort).  
- Participant 2: inferred below mean PSS despite pronounced sleep disturbance (i.e., overall lower perceived stress for their cohort).  
Given these within-sample inferences and the relative strength of protective vs. risk signals described for each participant, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

16,36385,23,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 12 (classified as disturbed sleep). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.50), so this raw score is a strong domain-specific signal favoring higher perceived stress.
- Emotional dysregulation: BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability = 8.33 (z = 0.53) and this measure has a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.65), making it a potent predictor of elevated perceived stress for this individual.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large hourly nocturnal HR elevations (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM) and positive correlations of these deviations with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41) support greater physiological arousal linked to stress.
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone: high resting HR (78.21 bpm, z = 1.37) and elevated mesor (z = 1.18) are consistent with sustained sympathetic activity or reduced recovery, which often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Severe sleep timing instability: extremely long median sleep (12 h, z = 2.26) and very large night‑to‑night variability (SD = 320 min, z = 2.38) can reflect dysregulation that is commonly associated with stress-related impairment.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Substantially elevated depressive symptoms: CES‑D = 29 (z = 1.63). CES‑D is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), and this is one of the largest standardized elevations reported across the two profiles.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 49 (z = 0.76), which also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31) and signals greater affective vulnerability.
- Low self‑esteem: RSES z = −1.01; lower self‑esteem modestly associates with higher PSS (r ≈ −0.15).
- Sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep) plus large sleep‑start SD (≈140 min, z = 1.26). Both subjective sleep problems and timing variability correlate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Objective physiology consistent with modest arousal/instability: resting HR moderately elevated (64.05 bpm, z = 0.70), increased intradaily variability (IV z ≈ 0.10), and evening HR elevations—all provide convergent though smaller‑magnitude physiological support for higher stress.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Directional inference in each summary: Participant 1’s profile was interpreted as near the population mean (Population PSS mean = 20.96) with domain‑specific elevations but multiple protective signals; Participant 2’s profile was explicitly interpreted as above their population mean (Population PSS mean = 21.61).
- Magnitude and type of risk signals: Participant 1 has several notable physiological and sleep‑related risk signals (strong nocturnal HR deviations, high resting HR, extreme sleep quantity/variability) and a strong predictor in emotional lability (high correlation with PSS). However, these are counterbalanced by clear protective psychosocial features (low pain, good interpersonal relationships, only mild generalized anxiety), resulting in an overall near‑mean classification.
- Participant 2 shows robust self‑report affective elevations (CES‑D z = 1.63 is substantial; STAI z = 0.76) that directly map onto constructs closely linked to perceived stress. Although some physiological signals are smaller in magnitude than Participant 1’s, the combination of elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, and sleep‑timing irregularity yields a consistent multi‑domain pattern that the original summary judged as above the population mean.
- Relative effect sizes: Participant 1’s strongest single predictor (emotional lability) has a very strong correlation with PSS, but that predictor’s z (0.53) is moderate and is weighed against multiple protective psychosocial measures. Participant 2’s depressive symptom elevation (CES‑D z = 1.63) is a larger standardized deviation and, together with elevated STAI and sleep timing irregularity, produces a more unambiguously elevated psychosocial risk profile relative to that population.

Weighting of evidence and final determination
- Given that Participant 1 was rated near their study mean after balancing strong physiological/sleep signals with protective psychosocial factors, while Participant 2 was rated above their study mean based on sizable self‑reported affective symptom elevations plus corroborating wearable signals, the overall balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

16,45963,23,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 62, Z = 2.05). Trait anxiety is positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31) and is a strong signal for higher perceived stress in this sample.
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 22, Z = 0.9), which also correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and very irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:56; start-time SD Z = 2.89), both consistent with higher perceived stress in this dataset.
- Pronounced circadian disruption: low amplitude (Z = −2.13) and very low interdaily stability (Z = −2.06). Lower amplitude/stability are associated with higher PSS (amplitude r ≈ −0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ −0.11).
- Elevated cardiovascular baseline (resting HR Z ≈ 1.2; MESOR Z ≈ 1.07), modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.13).
- Multiple converging signals across psychological, subjective-sleep, physiological, and circadian domains point toward above-mean perceived stress in this population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Substantial subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 12), and PSQI correlates fairly strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.50). (Note: PSQI z = −0.48 relative to this study’s distribution, so raw severity contrasts with population-relative placement.)
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.65), making it a potent domain-specific risk factor.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (1–4 AM increases of +10.24, +7.34, +4.18 bpm) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), plus elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ 1.18–1.37) — physiological signs consistent with arousal or reduced recovery.
- Very long median sleep duration (12 h, Z = 2.26) and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD Z = 2.38); while these wearable sleep metrics have weak direct correlations with PSS in this dataset, they can reflect dysregulation often seen with stress in other contexts.
- However, several protective/mitigating factors are present (low pain and pain interference with medium-to-large negative z-scores and correlations with PSS, strong interpersonal functioning z ≈ −1.77, only mild anxiety relative to peers which is important because GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS), making a clear above-mean inference less certain.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Magnitude and centrality of signals: Participant 1 shows a very large positive deviation on trait anxiety (Z = 2.05) — the single largest psychological risk deviation across the two profiles — plus multiple other above/below‑2.0 Z-score circadian disruptions (amplitude and interdaily stability Zs ≈ −2.1). Those deviations are substantial relative to Participant 1’s study population and are concordant with higher PSS.
- Participant 2 has strong domain-specific predictors (emotional lability with a large PSS correlation; nocturnal HR elevations with moderate correlation) and elevated baseline HR, but these are balanced by several robust protective signals (notably low pain interference and better interpersonal functioning) and by the fact that some of participant 2’s largest Z-scores (e.g., long sleep duration, sleep variability) are on metrics that show weak correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Correlation strength matters: Several of Participant 2’s risk signs (emotional lability, nocturnal HR) have relatively strong correlations with PSS, which raises the possibility of elevated perceived stress. Still, Participant 1 combines a very large psychological risk (trait anxiety Z=2.05) with multiple converging physiological/circadian disruptions; even when some individual correlations are modest, the multi-domain convergence increases confidence that Participant 1 is above their sample mean.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s profile is characterized as explicitly “above the study sample mean” in its summary and includes several high-magnitude deviations tied to PSS. Participant 2’s summary is explicitly “near the study sample mean,” with mixed risk/protective factors and some key protective domains that would reduce overall PSS relative to peers.

21,21793,30,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their sample mean = 21.6)
- Disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05), which is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Very late and highly variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~03:36 AM; start-time SD Z ≈ +1.04) and lots of napping (mean naps Z = +3.05) consistent with sleep/circadian dysregulation that correlates modestly with PSS.
- Marked circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.98) and elevated intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +0.95) — features linked to higher perceived stress (albeit with modest correlations).
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.17), which shows a relatively strong positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ +0.31).
- Recent academic stressor (notable GPA decline) and lower self-reported happiness/trust, which could contribute to perceived stress.
- Counterbalances: several physiological and behavioral protective features (low resting HR and MESOR, low substance use, some socializing and exercise, moderate health satisfaction) mitigate but do not eliminate the sleep/anxiety signal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their sample mean = 20.67)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 12; z ≈ +0.46) — this is the single strongest predictor here given a very high correlation with PSS (r ≈ +0.77).
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; z ≈ +1.32), itself correlated with higher PSS (r ≈ +0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: clear overnight heart-rate elevations (hourly deviations with z-scores up to ≈ +1.0) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39), indicating disturbed nocturnal recovery.
- Lower self-efficacy (z ≈ -0.25) and high emotional lability (BASIS-24) — both linked to higher perceived stress (NGSE correlation ≈ -0.66; BASIS-24 correlation ≈ +0.68).
- Elevated substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ +1.5) — potentially stress-relevant even if its correlation with PSS here is small.
- Counterbalances: objectively adequate average sleep duration (median ≈ 7 h 19 min, z ≈ +0.66), lower resting HR (z ≈ -0.64), and modestly preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation; lower pain/activity interference — these reduce but do not negate the psychological/autonomic signals.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both participants are assessed as above their respective study means. The population means differ only slightly (21.6 for Participant 1 vs 20.67 for Participant 2), so absolute mean differences are not decisive.
- Strength and predictive validity of indicators: Participant 2’s strongest predictors (GAD-7 and PSQI) have substantially larger correlations with PSS in their dataset (r ≈ 0.77 and 0.45) than Participant 1’s strongest predictors (STAI r ≈ 0.31; sleep-timing/circadian measures with r values ≈ 0.11–0.16). This implies that, within each study, Participant 2’s elevated measures are more tightly linked to PSS.
- Magnitude/severity of symptom indicators: Participant 2’s PSQI is very high (z ≈ +1.32, PSQI = 17.5) and GAD-7 is in the clinically meaningful range; Participant 1’s PSQI is elevated but substantially lower (PSQI = 9, z ≈ +1.05) and STAI elevation is modest. Although Participant 1 shows extreme nap frequency (z ≈ +3.05) and large interdaily stability deficit (z ≈ -1.98), those features have only modest correlations with PSS in that sample, limiting their weight.
- Physiological signals: Both have some protective low resting HR. Participant 2, however, has clear nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS; Participant 1 shows blunted circadian amplitude/instability but nocturnal HR deviations are not described as strongly elevated. Thus physiological evidence better converges with psychological distress for Participant 2.

Overall judgment weighing the evidence
- While both participants appear above their respective sample means, Participant 2 has stronger, higher-impact indicators that are more tightly associated with PSS in their dataset (notably GAD-7 and PSQI, plus nocturnal HR elevations and emotional-lability measures). Participant 1’s elevation is driven largely by sleep-timing and circadian irregularity and modest trait anxiety, but those predictors have weaker correlations with PSS in that sample, and several protective features attenuate the signal.
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

21,67192,30,31,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1's study frame)
- High depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 32; Z ≈ 1.95). CES‑D shows a positive (though modest) correlation with PSS (0.27), so this is a strong individual-level signal of elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z ≈ 1.65) with a modest PSS correlation (0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and marked sleep‑timing irregularity (late median sleep start, high night‑to‑night variability), which in this sample correlate positively with PSS.
- Elevated tonic/evening cardiac arousal (high mesor, higher resting HR, pronounced evening HR deviations), which supports an interpretation of greater physiological arousal linked to stress.
- Low health satisfaction and underweight BMI (Z ≈ -2.03 and BMI 17.8), adding to an overall distress signal.

Mitigating factors noted in the same frame: objective sleep duration is adequate, circadian regularity metrics are relatively strong (interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation high), high social time and low substance use — all of which tend to buffer or predict lower PSS in that sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2's study frame)
- Moderately elevated generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12; Z ≈ 0.46) that has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — high predictive weight.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5; Z ≈ 1.32) with a substantial correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (hourly deviations around midnight–3am, z up to ≈1.02) that correlate positively with PSS in this sample.
- High emotional lability on BASIS‑24 (variable given, but BASIS‑24 emotional lability correlates ≈ 0.68 with PSS), and reduced self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25 with strong negative correlation to PSS ≈ -0.66) — both point toward greater perceived stress vulnerability.
- Some elevated substance‑use score (z ≈ 1.5), though its correlation with PSS is negligible in this dataset.

Mitigating factors in this frame: objective sleep duration is slightly above median and sleep variability low, lower resting HR and preserved circadian amplitude/24‑h autocorrelation, and lower pain/activity interference — these are weaker predictors (small/negative correlations) and temper but do not override the high‑impact signals.

Comparative reasoning (taking within‑population correlations and effect sizes into account)
- Participant 1 shows large deviations on depression and trait anxiety (high Zs), but those measures have only modest correlations with PSS in their study (≈0.27–0.31). Some physiological signs (evening HR) add support, but several protective/neutral markers (good objective sleep duration, strong circadian regularity, high social time) reduce the net weight.
- Participant 2 has predictor variables that, although sometimes more moderate in Z (e.g., GAD‑7 Z ≈ 0.46), are much more strongly associated with PSS in their study (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77; BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.68; PSQI r ≈ 0.45). PSQI is markedly elevated (Z ≈ 1.32) and nocturnal autonomic elevations further align with PSS. Because those measures have higher correlations with PSS, they carry more predictive weight for elevated perceived stress in Participant 2’s sample.
- In other words, Participant 1’s large symptom Zs are applied to predictors with modest PSS correlations, while Participant 2’s more moderate Zs map onto predictors with strong correlations to PSS. Thus the expected increase in PSS (relative to each study mean) is plausibly larger for Participant 2.

Conclusion
On balance of evidence (taking each description’s within‑sample correlations and Z‑scores into account), Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Objective sleep disturbance relevant to PSS: shorter median sleep duration (6h38m, Z ≈ −0.69), very large night‑to‑night sleep duration variability (SD = 242 min, Z ≈ +3.21) and variable/late sleep onset (median ≈ 02:07, start‑time SD Z ≈ +1.54). Sleep variability and late timing have small‑to‑moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Reduced positive affect / self‑view: lower current happiness and slightly below‑mean self‑esteem align with elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms and with greater perceived stress.
- Convergence across affective + objective sleep irregularity supports inference of above‑mean PSS (summary explicitly concluded “moderately above the population mean”).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly predictive self‑report elevations: GAD‑7 = 8 (anxiety) with very high sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.77); emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z ≈ +0.63, r ≈ 0.66); disturbed sleep per PSQI = 13 (r ≈ 0.49); pain/interference measures (PEG r ≈ 0.44). Several of these measures are among the dataset’s strongest correlates with PSS.
- Wearable and circadian signatures consistent with stress: elevated resting HR (76.35 bpm, Z ≈ +1.19) and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.24), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ −1.05), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.46), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.07). These indicate blunted day–night rhythm and physiological activation that align with higher PSS.
- Objective sleep extremely compromised: median nightly sleep ≈ 1 h 39 min (Z ≈ −1.27) and very late median sleep onset (~04:36 AM). Elevated early‑morning heart rate and naps support a consolidated pattern of very limited nocturnal sleep and nocturnal hyperarousal—both consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Multiple strong, convergent indicators (subjective anxiety, emotional lability, PSQI, elevated HR metrics) that are highly correlated with PSS in the sample, leading the summary to conclude above‑mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Strength and number of predictors: Participant 2’s profile includes multiple measures with large sample correlations to PSS (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77, emotional lability r ≈ 0.66, self‑efficacy r ≈ −0.65) and multiple physiological/circadian deviations in the direction associated with stress. Participant 1’s elevated indicators (CES‑D, STAI, sleep irregularity) are present but have smaller sample correlations with PSS (roughly r ≈ 0.17–0.32) and are partly offset by strong protective behaviors (frequent exercise, high social/recreational engagement, very low substance use) and preserved circadian structure.
- Convergence vs. mitigation: Participant 2 shows convergent evidence from both highly predictive self‑reports and wearable physiology pointing toward higher perceived stress. Participant 1 shows a mixed pattern—some affective and sleep risk but also substantial resilience factors and weaker correlations to PSS.
- Artifacts/caveats: Participant 2’s extreme objective sleep shortness may partly reflect recording artifact (noted in the summary), which would temper confidence; however, even allowing for that caveat, multiple independent, strongly correlated self‑report measures and physiological signals support higher stress relative to that sample.

- Markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 37, Z = 2.47) and trait anxiety (STAI = 62, Z = 2.05), both known to co-occur with higher perceived stress in this cohort.
- Low reported happiness (Z = -1.61) and below-average self-esteem (Z = -1.29), which align with higher stress.
- Elevated tonic cardiovascular markers (resting HR Z = 1.34; MESOR Z = 1.49), suggesting greater physiological arousal associated with stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), indicating perceived poor sleep quality despite long objective sleep.
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:52 AM) and slightly elevated intradaily variability, both potentially linked to stress/mood disturbance.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean):
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 8) where GAD-7 shows a very strong correlation with PSS in this dataset (r = 0.77), making this a powerful predictor of higher PSS.
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63) and low self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44) — both measures that correlate strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.66 and -0.65, respectively).
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) with a substantial correlation to PSS (r = 0.49).
- Wearable indicators of physiological/circadian dysregulation: elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.2 each), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z = -1.05), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.07), low interdaily stability, and pronounced early-morning HR elevations — patterns consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and higher perceived stress.
- Extremely short and very late objective sleep episodes (median ~1 h 39 min; sleep start ~04:36 AM), corroborated by very poor PSQI, though the objective duration may be partially artifactual.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning:
- Both participants are interpreted as above their respective sample means. Key differences are in the predictors’ strength and consistency with PSS in each dataset.
- Participant 1 shows very large deviations on depression and trait-anxiety scales (large positive Zs), but in this study those measures correlate only moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Protective/mitigating behaviors (long objective sleep, regular daily rhythms, no substance use, good academic functioning) are also present and partially offset stress signals.
- Participant 2’s profile includes multiple measures that both deviate from the mean and have very strong correlations with PSS in this sample (notably GAD-7 r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, self-efficacy r = -0.65). In addition, Participant 2 shows coherent wearable evidence of circadian disruption and nocturnal/early-morning physiological arousal that aligns with the self-report indicators. Although some objective sleep figures may be noisy/artifactual, the subjective PSQI and multiple concordant physiological signals strengthen the inference of elevated perceived stress.
- In short, Participant 1 has pronounced mood symptoms but weaker PSS correlational linkage and more behavioral protections; Participant 2 has several moderately-to-strongly correlated predictors of PSS and consistent physiological/circadian evidence of dysregulation.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (disturbed sleep; Z = 1.0) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.47).
- Severe objective sleep problems: median nightly sleep 2 h 38 min (Z = -0.94), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median sleep start 03:12 AM; SD onset Z = 1.3). These extreme short/irregular sleep patterns are strongly consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., +13.54 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = 1.17; +9.79 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = 1.59) and moderate positive correlations between overnight HR elevations and PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Pain/interference modestly elevated (PAPAS = 65, Z = 0.19) and pain correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (reduced interdaily stability, increased intradaily variability) that align with higher stress when combined with poor sleep and nocturnal arousal.

Countervailing (protective) features noted: relatively higher self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 0.3) and low emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = -0.97), both of which have strong inverse correlations with PSS. These reduce but do not appear to outweigh the strong sleep/anxiety/arousal signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (Z = 0.59) and PSQI correlates positively with PSS.
- Very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (sleep SD Z = 3.37), which is strongly linked to stress and irregular routines.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and reduced mesor (amplitude Z = -0.81; mesor Z = -1.28), features modestly associated with higher PSS in the dataset.
- Some trait anxiety (STAI = 40) and lower-than-average happiness, which correlate modestly with PSS (STAI r ≈ 0.31; happiness r ≈ -0.19).

Countervailing (protective) features: low resting HR and low heart-rate mesor (protective autonomic profile), very low intradaily variability (Z = -1.73) indicating within-day consolidation, frequent exercise and high socializing (exercise Z = 1.58; social Z = 1.74), above-average self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.40), nonclinical depressive symptoms, and absence of recreational drug use. Overall these protective features are numerous and relatively strong.

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Both participants are described as above their respective study population means, but the strength and number of high-PSS predictors differ.
- Participant 1 has multiple high-impact indicators strongly linked to PSS in that sample: moderate clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) with a very large correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.78), extremely poor subjective sleep (PSQI 16.5) and extreme objective short/irregular sleep with nocturnal cardiovascular arousal. Pain adds further upward pressure. Although P1 has protective traits (self-efficacy, low emotional lability), the highest-weight correlates for PSS (anxiety and sleep/arousal) are present and pronounced.
- Participant 2 shows a mix of risk and protective signals. Risk signals (subjective sleep problems, very high sleep variability, blunted circadian amplitude, some anxiety) are present but their correlations with PSS are generally smaller than the GAD-7 → PSS link in Participant 1. Importantly, P2 also shows multiple substantive protective behaviors/physiology (low RHR/mesor, low intradaily variability, frequent exercise, strong socializing, higher self-esteem) that the summary identifies as buffering stress, and the overall inference for P2 was only “slightly above” the study mean.
- Taken within each study’s correlation structure, the predictors present for Participant 1 are both stronger (in terms of correlation magnitudes) and more extreme (e.g., near-total sleep deprivation and nocturnal arousal) than the predictors for Participant 2, which are more mixed and partially offset by robust protective behaviors and physiology.

Inference
- Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) compared with Participant 2.

19,74899,28,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait Z = +1.06). Trait anxiety is one of the stronger positive correlates of PSS in this sample (r = 0.31), so this is a primary driver toward higher perceived stress.
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = +0.38), which also positively correlate with PSS (r = 0.28).
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = +1.05, disturbed sleep), a notable contributor to higher PSS in this cohort.
- Objective sleep pattern that is late and short (median sleep ≈ 5 h 58 min, Z = −1.52; late onset ~02:25 AM), which, together with poor PSQI, aligns with stress-related sleep disruption.
- Circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = +0.46; lower 24‑h autocorrelation Z = −0.19) and evening heart‑rate deviations (largest positive deviation 5–6 pm Z = +1.69) that are associated (even if modestly) with higher PSS in this sample.
- Protective features (frequent exercise, high self‑rated physical health, high interpersonal trust) exist but have small/near‑zero correlations with PSS in this dataset, so they likely only partially offset the above risk indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +1.0) and extreme objective sleep disruption (median sleep ~2 h 38 min, Z = −0.94; very late start 03:12 AM; high night‑to‑night onset variability Z = +1.3). PSQI and sleep disruption have moderate positive correlations with PSS (PSQI r = 0.47).
- Marked nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (overnight HR deviations up to Z ≈ +1.59) with moderate correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38), indicating physiological arousal during expected sleep hours—a contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10). Although this participant’s GAD‑7 is only slightly above the study mean (Z = +0.11), GAD‑7 has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), so even modest anxiety could strongly relate to elevated PSS.
- Pain‑related interference (PAPAS Z ≈ +0.19) which correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective)
- Higher-than-average self‑efficacy (New General Self‑Efficacy Z = +0.3) and notably low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z = −0.97). Both measures have strong sample correlations with PSS (self‑efficacy r = −0.68; emotional lability r = +0.72), so these are substantial buffering factors likely to lower perceived stress despite sleep/physiological disturbances.
- Some daytime cardiac metrics and substance‑use indices are not strongly indicative of elevated stress.

Comparative within‑population reasoning and weighing evidence
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means. The key question is which profile implies a higher PSS overall.
- Participant 1 shows multiple psychiatric symptom signals (trait anxiety notably elevated, depression elevated), disturbed subjective sleep, circadian fragmentation, and evening physiological activation. Many of these features are above average and, while several individual correlations with PSS are moderate or modest, the cumulative pattern across anxiety, mood, subjective sleep, and circadian/physiological irregularity is consistent and unopposed by strong protective factors (the protective behaviors present have weak sample correlations with PSS).
- Participant 2 exhibits very severe objective sleep loss and nocturnal physiological arousal—strong contributors to higher PSS—and has a GAD‑7 at the threshold for clinically relevant anxiety (and GAD‑7 is highly predictive of PSS in that study). However, Participant 2 also has two strong trait‑level protective factors (self‑efficacy and low emotional lability) that, in this sample, have large correlations with PSS and are likely to substantially reduce perceived stress estimates.
- In short: Participant 2 has more extreme sleep/physiologic disruption, but also has powerful protective traits strongly linked to lower PSS. Participant 1 has multiple above‑average symptom indicators (notably trait anxiety and poor subjective sleep) and circadian/physiologic signs of stress, with protective factors that are less strongly tied to lower PSS in the sample. The balance of evidence therefore favors Participant 1 as exhibiting the higher overall perceived stress.

7,93699,15,13,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05) — clinically meaningful poor sleep, a strong correlate of higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI–Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27; classified “anxious”), which correlates positively with PSS.
- Later/shorter/variable sleep timing: wearable median sleep ≈ 6 h 51 min (z ≈ −0.42), median sleep start ~00:59, sleep-start SD ≈ 89 min — patterns associated with higher perceived stress.
- High evening/late-night internet use: >4 hours (z ≈ +2.19), which can exacerbate sleep problems and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation: resting HR ≈ 64.8 bpm (z ≈ +0.79) and MESOR z ≈ +0.74 — consistent with greater tonic autonomic activation linked to PSS.
- (Countervailing evidence noted but weaker for raising PSS): low depressive symptoms and good circadian regularity mitigate risk, which is why the summary judged the participant above the mean but not extreme.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Very short and highly variable wearable sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 4 h 22 min and large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 216 min; z ≈ +0.89; sleep onset SD = 204 min) — objective pattern strongly associated with stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15.5 (z ≈ +0.67), which has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53) in this dataset.
- Pronounced interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal score z ≈ +2.34 — a salient contextual contributor to ongoing perceived stress (even if its sample correlation with PSS is weak).
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened amplitude: interdaily stability and autocorrelation low (e.g., interdaily stability z ≈ −1.05) and cosinor amplitude z ≈ −0.84 — patterns that commonly co-occur with elevated stress.
- (Countervailing evidence noted but weaker for raising PSS): very low reported anxiety (GAD-7 z ≈ −1.38), low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, and lower resting HR — all point away from high perceived stress and are relatively strong protective signals in this sample.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Both summaries conclude the participant is at or slightly above their sample mean PSS: Participant 1 was judged “above the sample mean” (modest–moderate elevation), Participant 2 was judged “near the sample mean, with a modest tilt toward being above.”
- Participant 2 shows more extreme objective sleep deprivation/variability and a very large interpersonal-strain z-score (z ≈ +2.34), which are strong stress-linked signals. However, Participant 2 also shows several strong protective indicators that, in this sample, are tightly linked to lower PSS (very low anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, low resting HR, and near-average self-efficacy).
- Participant 1 shows multiple converging indicators of elevated perceived stress that are directly tied to PSS in this dataset (clinically meaningful PSQI, trait anxiety, later/shorter sleep, high evening internet use, and modestly elevated resting HR). While not extreme, these indicators are numerous and consistent, and the study summary explicitly rates Participant 1 as above the population mean.
- On balance, the evidence indicates Participant 1 is more clearly and consistently above their study’s mean PSS. Participant 2 has some very severe objective sleep and interpersonal problems but also several strong protective signals that pull their overall inferred PSS closer to the population mean.

7,92412,15,16,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.81), which in this sample has a modest positive correlation with PSS and can reflect fragmentation of rest/activity associated with stress.
- Moderately reduced circadian rigidity (autocorrelation24 Z = -0.28; interdaily stability Z = 0.17), indicating some day-to-day variability that can accompany stress.
- Large evening heart-rate deviations (5–6 PM value Z = 4.19) and broader evening HR elevations; if these reflect physiological arousal rather than only exercise, they could contribute to higher perceived stress.
- A few small wearable-derived features show positive (though small) correlations with PSS (e.g., nighttime-to-morning HR deviations).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; Z = 0.67) and a moderate-to-strong sample correlation between PSQI and PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 m) and large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD Z = 0.89) and sleep onset time (SD Z ≈ 0.34) — objective sleep deficits and irregularity are well-established correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 2.34), a salient contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress.
- Dampened circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.84), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.05), and low autocorrelation at 24 h — collectively indicating weakened daily structure that co-occurs with higher stress in group-level data.
- Evening HR elevations coupled with blunted amplitude and irregular rhythms may reflect behavioral/physiological patterns often seen with elevated stress.

Comparative, within-population framing
- Participant 1 is characterized in its report as most consistent with perceived stress below their population mean (population mean PSS = 21.63, SD = 3.67). Multiple strong indicators (CES-D and STAI ~ -1 SD, PSQI Z = -1.26, high happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, sleep regularity) point toward lower-than-average PSS. The stress-consistent signals for this participant are relatively small in magnitude or plausibly explained by healthy behavior (evening exercise).
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely near the mean of their population with a modest tilt upward (population mean PSS = 21.29, SD = 7.42). Several fairly strong stress-related signals (very short and irregular objective sleep, disturbed subjective sleep with a relatively large PSQI→PSS correlation, and large interpersonal strain Z = 2.34) point toward higher perceived stress relative to their study sample. Protective signs (very low anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR) moderate the inference but do not fully counterbalance the substantial sleep disruption and interpersonal stressors.
- Because each description is relative to its own study population mean, the correct comparison is: Participant 1 ≈ below their population mean; Participant 2 ≈ near-to-somewhat-above their population mean. That implies Participant 2 is more likely to have the higher absolute PSS score relative to their respective study norms.

Overall judgment
- Weighting the number, magnitude, and relevance of features: Participant 2 shows stronger, more directly stress-linked indicators (severe objective sleep restriction and variability, disturbed subjective sleep with a strong sample-level PSQI→PSS correlation, and large interpersonal problems) than the modest stress-consistent signals in Participant 1. Participant 1’s profile is overall protective and points below their sample mean, whereas Participant 2 sits at or slightly above their sample mean.

- Subjective poor sleep quality: PSQI = 8 (classified as disturbed sleep), which in the study is associated with higher PSS.
- Episodic physiological arousal: elevated hourly heart‑rate deviations at midday and late evening (z ≈ 2.1–3.1) could reflect stress-reactive episodes that increase perceived stress.
- Increased intradaily variability (HR IV z ≈ 0.95) and somewhat reduced momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53) are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Taken together these features could raise perceived stress episodically despite otherwise healthy signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Severe and objective sleep disruption: PSQI = 13.5 (disturbed), median sleep ≈ 3 h/night, and very large night‑to‑night sleep timing variability (SD sleep start Z = 2.82). These sleep measures are strongly correlated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9 (and r ≈ 0.78 with PSS) and BASIS‑24 emotional lability (r ≈ 0.68) are both strongly associated with higher PSS.
- Substance‑related problems (BASIS‑24 substance Z = 1.75) and pain-related interference also correlate positively with PSS and can contribute to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian rhythm instability (low interdaily stability Z = -1.42, low amplitude) further aligns with higher PSS in this sample.
- Protective factors (very high self-efficacy, low resting HR) are present but do not outweigh multiple, strongly PSS‑related risk indicators.

Comparative, within‑frame weighting and conclusion
- Participant 1’s strongest signals point toward lower-than-average perceived stress in their population (low CES‑D and STAI‑Trait, high self‑esteem, long/regular objective sleep, low resting HR). The indicators suggesting higher stress are moderate and episodic (subjective poor sleep, intraday HR peaks).
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple, large, and strongly PSS‑correlated signals (extreme short and irregular sleep, high PSQI, elevated anxiety and emotional lability, substance‑related problems, circadian instability). Although Participant 2 has a strong protective factor (high self‑efficacy) and lower resting HR, the magnitude and number of high‑risk indicators that strongly correlate with PSS outweigh the protective signals.
- Both descriptions explicitly place Participant 1 below their population mean and Participant 2 above theirs; the size and strength of Participant 2’s PSS‑related indicators are substantially greater than the comparatively modest stress signals for Participant 1.

5,17932,14,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe and objectively confirmed sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 and wearable median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 4 m with extremely high night‑to‑night timing variability (SD start time Z = 2.82). These sleep features are strongly correlated with PSS in this sample and are large, convergent signals of elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9 (mild anxiety) and elevated BASIS‑24 emotional lability (Z = 0.43). In this dataset these measures show strong positive correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78).
- Substance‑related problems and pain interference: High substance abuse subscale (Z = 1.75) and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — additional stress contributors.
- Circadian instability and damped rhythms: Low interdaily stability and low amplitude (Z’s ≈ -1.4 and -1.1) consistent with poorer sleep/greater stress.
- Multiple independent measures point in the same direction (subjective + objective sleep disruption, anxiety, substance problems), increasing confidence that perceived stress is above that study’s mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- High subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (Z ≈ 2.9) and late habitual sleep onset (~01:24), which in prior work and in this study often associate with higher perceived stress.
- Some evening heart‑rate deviations and lower social trust / slightly lower happiness scores, which could modestly contribute to perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑population framing
- Each description is relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.33, SD = 7.38; P2 mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). Both participants show an elevated PSQI relative to their populations, but the rest of their multimodal profiles differ markedly.
- Participant 1’s elevated signals are multiple, strong, and convergent on higher PSS (objective extreme short sleep + subjective disturbance, anxiety, substance problems, circadian irregularity), and several of those measures have high sample correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2’s strongest high‑stress signal is the PSQI, but it conflicts with a broad set of protective, objective markers (long objective sleep duration, low resting HR, robust circadian stability, regular exercise) and low trait anxiety/depression. The summary places P2 near or slightly below their sample mean despite the high PSQI.
- The slight difference in population means (21.33 vs 21.62) is negligible for this comparative judgment; what matters is the within‑profile evidence relative to each population.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 1: multiple large, PSS‑correlated indicators pointing upward (and an objectively extreme sleep deficit) outweigh the protective signals (high self‑efficacy, low resting HR).
- Participant 2: the isolated high PSQI is counterbalanced by many objective and trait measures that predict lower perceived stress; the integrated inference was near/slightly below the population mean.

Final decision
Based on the balance of multimodal evidence within each study frame, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

23,69831,17,16,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) despite long objective sleep → possible perceived poor sleep quality linked to stress.
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:34 AM) and delayed schedule, which can produce circadian misalignment and daytime strain.
- Low physical activity (reports no exercise) and high passive media/social time — behavioral patterns associated with greater perceived stress.
- Low happiness and low health satisfaction (z’s negative) and a recent academic decline (GPA 1.90) — psychosocial stressors that can raise perceived stress.
- These behavioral/subjective signals could push perceived stress upward even if physiology is relatively calm.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Markedly short objective sleep (median ~4 h 21 min) and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5) — strong sleep-related risk for elevated perceived stress.
- High nocturnal heart-rate deviations around midnight–2 AM (large positive bpm deviations) that correlate moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.46), indicating nocturnal arousal linked to higher stress.
- Large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min) → irregular sleep tied to higher perceived stress in population studies.
- These nocturnal/sleep indicators could elevate perceived stress relative to peers, even if daytime traits look healthy.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s write-up explicitly concludes perceived stress is best characterized as “near the population mean” (mean = 21.63). Their strongest signals toward higher PSS are behavioral/subjective (sleep complaint, late schedule, low exercise, academic problems), but physiological and trait measures (low RHR, low intradaily variability, below-mean STAI/CES-D, good self-esteem) are protective.
- Participant 2’s write-up explicitly concludes perceived stress is likely below the population mean (mean = 21.21). Although they show severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance and nocturnal arousal (risks), they also show very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 2) and relatively high self-efficacy — two trait measures that have large sample correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77, NGSE r ≈ -0.65) and therefore strongly predict lower PSS in this cohort.
- Weighing predictor strength: Participant 2’s strongest protective indicators (very low GAD-7 and higher NGSE) are more strongly correlated with PSS in their sample than many of Participant 1’s protective signals. Participant 1’s risk signals are moderate and distributed across behavior/subjective domains, but overall the integrative inference in their report is “near mean,” not clearly elevated.

Overall balance and decision
- Participant 1: inferred near-mean PSS with multiple moderate behavioral/subjective risk factors and several physiological/trait protections.
- Participant 2: inferred below-mean PSS driven by strong trait-level protections despite severe sleep-related risks.
- Therefore, relative to their respective study populations, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Low physical activity (reports effectively no exercise), a behavior associated with higher perceived stress.
- Heavy passive media use and socializing (high z-scores), patterns often correlated with higher stress or poorer coping.
- Lower current happiness and low health satisfaction (negative z-scores).

- These behavioral/subjective features could push their PSS above the protective signal from physiology, yielding a score at or slightly above the population mean.

- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10, “Disturbed Sleep”) with a strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.46).
- Severe objective sleep restriction (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 27 min) and high sleep-duration variability — both are potent stressors and risk factors for elevated perceived stress.
- Very high intradaily variability (IV = 0.64, z = 2.29) indicating fragmented rest-activity patterns associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale), which could contribute to stress (though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small/uncertain).

Comparative, within-population framing and relevant predictor strengths
- Participant 1 is characterized in their write-up as “near the mean” PSS for a population mean of 21.63. Their strongest indicators (physiologic: low RHR, good circadian amplitude, low IV; and low trait anxiety/CES-D) are associated with lower PSS in that sample; behavioral indicators provide countervailing stress signals but appear weaker or mixed.
- Participant 2 is characterized as leaning toward “below the mean” PSS for a population mean of 21.42. Critically, some of the strongest sample-level predictors (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy NGSE, and very low emotional lability) strongly predict lower PSS here (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.76, NGSE r = -0.65). Those strong predictors outweigh the severe sleep problems in the sample-level weighting applied by the assessor.
- The two population means are almost identical (21.63 vs 21.42), so relative positions (near-mean vs below-mean) are the key frame for comparison rather than absolute differences in population baselines.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed but overall assessed as near the sample mean; physiologic and mood/trait measures lean protective, while behavioral/subjective issues could elevate stress to about average or slightly above.
- Participant 2: mixed but explicitly assessed as below the sample mean, with very strong sample-level predictors (low anxiety, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) favoring lower perceived stress despite extreme sleep problems that constitute an important countervailing risk.
- Given those within-sample positions and the relative strengths of predictors, Participant 1 is more likely to have a higher PSS than Participant 2.

- Later sleep timing: median sleep start ~00:38; later bedtimes are sometimes associated with evening arousal and higher stress.  
- Small signs of physiological fragmentation: modestly elevated intradaily HR variability (Z ≈ 0.24) and some afternoon HR elevations that, in this sample, correlate positively with PSS.  
- Subjective–objective divergence: objective metrics look good but subjective complaints (PSQI) suggest perceived problems that could raise reported stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD-7 = 10.5 at screening threshold; GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77), making this a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress.  
- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z ≈ 0.53) and strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Substantive subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 8.5 (>5), which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Pain and interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS elevated (PAPAS Z ≈ 1.21), and these measures correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large overnight HR elevations around midnight–2am (+13–14 bpm, Z ≈ 1.25–1.36), and these nocturnal HR deviations correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Sleep variability/fragmentation: high night-to-night sleep SD (199 min, Z ≈ 0.65) can amplify subjective stress.

Comparative framing (within each study’s population)
- Participant 1’s profile is explicitly interpreted relative to their study mean (21.62) as overall below that mean: multiple protective indicators (low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem, regular restorative sleep by objective metrics, frequent exercise, low substance use, stable circadian measures) outweigh the modest subjective sleep complaint and small physiological fragmentation signals. The correlations linking P1’s objective features to PSS are generally small.  
- Participant 2’s profile is interpreted relative to their study mean (20.92) as above that mean: several strong survey predictors (notably GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77 and emotional lability with r ≈ 0.65), moderate-to-large subjective sleep and pain problems, and corroborating nocturnal HR elevations together provide stronger, convergent evidence of higher perceived stress despite some protective circadian and resting-HR indicators.

Overall weighing of evidence
- The strongest, most directly relevant predictors for elevated PSS are more numerous and stronger for Participant 2 (high-anxiety screening score with a very large correlation to PSS; emotional lability; disturbed sleep; pain; sizable nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS).  
- Participant 1 shows mostly protective signals and only modest/isolated risk indicators that are smaller in magnitude and have weaker correlations with PSS in that cohort.

- Relatively late median sleep start (~00:38) which can be associated with evening arousal or stress.
- Modestly elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythm and some afternoon heart-rate elevations, which in this cohort show small positive correlations with PSS.
- A small mismatch between good objective sleep metrics and worse subjective sleep could reflect psychological distress not captured by other measures.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any):
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 8) and emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63); these measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in the sample (GAD-7 r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66).
- Very high PSQI (13), a subjective index strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.49).
- Elevated pain/interference scores that correlate moderately with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Wearable indicators of physiological activation and circadian disruption: high resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.2), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z = -1.05), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.07), low interdaily stability — patterns consistent with hyperarousal and higher stress.
- Pronounced early-morning heart-rate deviations and extremely short median nightly sleep (1 h 39 m, Z = -1.27) with very late sleep onset (~04:36) and presence of naps — consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and fragmented/insufficient sleep that relate to higher PSS.
- Multiple independent signals (strongly correlated self-report measures plus physiological/circadian dysregulation) converge on higher perceived stress.

Comparative, population-relative reasoning:
- Each description is explicitly interpreted relative to its own cohort mean PSS. Participant 1 is judged by the provided synthesis to be below the study mean (21.62) based on many protective factors; the few stress-consistent signals are small and inconsistent.
- Participant 2 is judged by its synthesis to be above its study mean (21.08), with several strong self-report predictors of PSS (notably anxiety and emotional lability) and multiple physiological/circadian features pointing in the same direction. Several of these predictors have high correlations with PSS in the sample, strengthening the inference.
- The number, strength, and concordance of Participant 2’s indicators (especially the high-correlation self-report measures) outweigh the relatively modest and inconsistent indicators for Participant 1. Even allowing for possible artifacts in Participant 2’s extreme objective sleep metric, the converging subjective and physiological evidence supports higher perceived stress for Participant 2.

8,19735,20,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their summary)
- Strong psychological predictors that correlate highly with PSS in this sample:
  - Elevated anxiety-related signal (GAD-7 = 8) and anxiety measure has the largest correlation with PSS in the dataset (r = 0.77).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63; r with PSS = 0.66).
  - Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44; r with PSS = -0.65).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) which correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.49).
- Objective physiological and circadian signs consistent with hyperarousal/stress:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.2).
  - Blunted diurnal amplitude, elevated intradaily variability, low interdaily stability — indicating circadian disruption, which associates with higher PSS in the sample.
  - Pronounced early‑morning heart‑rate elevations (hours with Z > 1) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).
- Extremely short median nightly sleep by wearable (median ~1 h 39 m; Z = -1.27) and very late sleep timing (~04:36 AM) — if valid, these objectively extreme sleep patterns strongly suggest stress/insomnia-like hyperarousal.
- Pain/interference measures also show modest positive relationships with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).

Mitigating notes present in the summary: anxiety is only in the mild range; some wearable-to-PSS correlations are weak or inconsistent; the extremely short wearable sleep estimate may reflect nonwear or artifact.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their summary)
- Strong affective/trait predictors:
  - Substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 34; Z = 2.15), which in this sample relate positively to PSS (r ≈ 0.29).
  - Above‑average trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z = 0.56; r ≈ 0.31).
- Behavioral/social risk factors:
  - Very low socializing (≈15 minutes; Z ≈ -2.2) and minimal recreational/group activities, which can contribute to or reflect elevated perceived stress and low support.
  - Recreational drug use with a high relative Z (Z ≈ 3.52) — may indicate coping-related behavior even if its direct correlation with PSS is small.
- Sleep timing and circadian irregularity:
  - Late median sleep start (~02:01 AM) and reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.95), indicating inconsistent daily timing which modestly associates with higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17).
- Holistic summary in the source explicitly concludes PSS above the study mean (mean = 21.62).

Mitigating/protective evidence present: objectively adequate median sleep duration (~7 h 48 m), low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.93), relatively high cosinor amplitude and limited intradaily fragmentation — these attenuate but do not eliminate psychological risk signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study population frame
- Both participants are judged in their summaries to be above their respective study means for perceived stress. The question is which participant likely has the worse overall perceived stress.
- Participant 1 presents multiple high‑impact correlates of PSS in this dataset (anxiety measure with r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66; self‑efficacy r = -0.65; sleep disturbance r = 0.49). These are strong statistical links in the sample, and several independent modalities (subjective reports + physiological hyperarousal + disrupted circadian metrics + extremely short wearable sleep) converge on an elevated‑stress interpretation. The wearable physiological profile (nocturnal/early‑morning HR elevation, blunted amplitude, higher intradaily variability) further supports hyperarousal consistent with high perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows a very large depressive symptom signal (CES‑D Z = 2.15) and above‑average trait anxiety, plus behavioral markers of low social engagement and circadian inconsistency — all pointing above the sample mean. However, several objective physiological markers are protective (adequate objective sleep duration, low resting HR, high amplitude), which moderate the overall risk. The depressive signal is strong but the presence of robust nocturnal autonomic downregulation and near‑normal sleep duration suggests less physiological hyperarousal than Participant 1.
- Crucially, Participant 1’s summary documents multiple high‑correlation predictors of PSS (including the single strongest correlate in the dataset, anxiety r = 0.77) and convergent objective signs of autonomic/circadian dysregulation and very short wearable sleep (even with caveat). Participant 2’s strongest single signal is depressive symptoms (strong but lower sample correlation with PSS than Participant 1’s anxiety measure) and is offset by clearer physiological resilience markers.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Taking into account that each description is relative to its own population mean, the balance of psychological and objective physiological evidence points to Participant 1 having the worse overall perceived stress. Participant 1 shows stronger convergent risk across the highest‑correlating psychological predictors in the dataset plus wearable indicators of hyperarousal/circadian disruption; Participant 2 has strong depressive symptoms but more protective physiological features and adequate objective sleep that temper the likely PSS elevation.

- Substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 34; Z ≈ 2.15), and CES‑D correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.29).
- Above‑average trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z ≈ 0.56), another positive correlate of PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and late sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:01 AM); sleep timing variability and subjective sleep problems are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Very low socializing (≈15 minutes; Z ≈ -2.2), consistent with withdrawal/low social support which can accompany higher perceived stress.
- Some circadian irregularity (low 24‑hour autocorrelation; Z ≈ -0.95), which has a modest association with higher PSS.
- Recreational drug use is highly elevated relative to the sample (Z ≈ 3.52), which may reflect maladaptive coping even though its direct correlation with PSS in this dataset is small.

Reasons mitigating a higher PSS inference for Participant 1
- Objective sleep duration is adequate (median ≈ 7 h 48 m; Z ≈ 0.77), a modest protective factor.
- Low resting HR (50.3 bpm; Z ≈ -0.93) and relatively high circadian amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ 1.13) are protective signals associated with lower stress in the sample (though correlations are weak).
- Overall, strongest signals that predict PSS in this profile (CES‑D and STAI) have only moderate correlations with PSS in this dataset, and there are several protective physiological indices.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their sample)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 14.5; Z ≈ 0.9), and GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.80) — a highly predictive indicator.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ 0.33) with a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) with a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Objectively extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 m; Z ≈ -1.04) and very high night‑to‑night variability (start-time SD Z ≈ 1.16). Severe sleep restriction and variability are strongly relevant to perceived stress.
- Marked physiological dysregulation: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm; Z ≈ 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.34), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.23) — a pattern of fragmented/flattened rhythm consistent with higher stress.
- Nocturnal HR elevations (+8–9 bpm around midnight–2 AM) that have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).
- Pain/interference (PEG‑3) that correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).

Reasons mitigating a higher PSS inference for Participant 2
- Modestly higher self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 0.12) which correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.65) and could buffer stress.
- Some wearable‑PSS correlations (e.g., some daytime HR features) are small or mixed, so not every physiological elevation maps strongly to PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are characterized as above their respective study means for perceived stress. The question is which profile indicates higher PSS relative to their own population distributions.
- Participant 1’s single strongest abnormality (CES‑D Z ≈ 2.15) is sizable, but CES‑D’s correlation with PSS in that sample is modest (r ≈ 0.29). Several protective physiological factors (adequate sleep duration, low resting HR, high amplitude) moderate the overall inference.
- Participant 2 presents multiple abnormalities that are both substantial in magnitude and tied to measures that have strong sample‑level associations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 with r ≈ 0.80, emotional lability r ≈ 0.66, PSQI r ≈ 0.49, pain r ≈ 0.47). In addition, objective physiology shows severe disruption (very short sleep, high nocturnal HR, flattened amplitude, low stability) that aligns with higher PSS. While self‑efficacy is slightly elevated, it appears insufficient to counterbalance the strong convergent signals of anxiety, sleep deprivation/fragmentation, nocturnal arousal, and physiological rhythm disruption.

Balance of evidence and determination
- Considering (a) the strength and number of risk indicators, (b) the strength of their correlations with PSS within each sample, and (c) the presence of severe objective sleep and circadian/physiological disruption in Participant 2, the overall evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs.

16,96610,23,21,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (classified as disturbed sleep; Z = +0.59) — PSQI correlates positively with PSS in the dataset, so this is a signal toward higher perceived stress.
- Shorter-than-average sleep duration and late sleep timing: median nightly sleep ≈ 6 h 53 min (Z = -0.37) and late onset (~01:21) — shorter and late sleep are commonly associated with higher stress.
- Slightly elevated resting heart rate: 60.8 bpm (Z = +0.32) — resting HR correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), providing a small physiological signal of greater arousal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Strong subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 12 (disturbed sleep); PSQI has a moderate-to-strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.50).
- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = +0.53 with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.65) — a potent domain-specific predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal: marked overnight HR elevations (1–2 AM +10.24 bpm, 2–3 AM +7.34 bpm, 3–4 AM +4.18 bpm) and these nocturnal deviations correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone: resting HR z = +1.37 and mesor z = +1.18 — consistent with higher tonic arousal that relates to higher PSS.
- Marked sleep instability/atypical sleep duration: very long median sleep (12 h, z = +2.26) and very large night-to-night variability (SD z = +2.38) — while wearable sleep quantity has weak direct correlation with PSS in this dataset, these extremes often co-occur with dysregulation and stress-related problems.

Comparative reasoning within the population frames
- Participant 1 is described as having multiple, moderately strong indicators pointing to lower perceived stress relative to their study sample (trait mood/anxiety scores well below the sample mean; high self‑esteem and happiness; robust circadian amplitude and interdaily stability). The signals that point upward (sleep disturbance, slight RHR elevation) are modest in magnitude and fewer in number.
- Participant 2 is described as near the sample mean overall but exhibits several domain-specific, moderately-to-strongly correlated indicators of higher perceived stress (high PSQI raw score, emotional lability with strong PSS correlation, elevated nocturnal HR and high resting HR). Protective factors (lower pain, intact interpersonal functioning, mild GAD-7) moderate but do not eliminate the higher-stress signals.
- Because each profile must be interpreted relative to its own study population mean, the key comparison is directional strength and number of higher-stress vs. lower-stress indicators within each participant’s context. Participant 1 shows a convergent pattern of lower-than-average distress across multiple self-report and circadian metrics (strong negative z-scores on mood/anxiety measures). Participant 2 shows a cluster of higher-stress indicators that are more directly and strongly correlated with PSS in that dataset (emotional lability, PSQI, nocturnal HR, elevated resting HR), even though some domains are protective.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: net evidence points below their population mean PSS (several strong protective signals; only modest risk signals).
- Participant 2: net evidence centers near their population mean but includes multiple moderate-to-strong signals that would push perceived stress upward relative to peers (notably emotional lability and nocturnal/tonic cardiovascular arousal).
- Therefore, relative to their respective populations, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS score (i.e., worse overall perceived stress) than Participant 1.

- Additional functional/emotional disturbance: some emotional lability and interpersonal/behavioral signs that align with higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1: Multiple, moderate-to-strong indicators (low CES‑D, very low STAI, high self‑esteem, high momentary happiness, robust circadian amplitude and stability; several Zs around ±1.6 for affect measures and +0.8 to +1.0 for circadian features) converge toward lower perceived stress relative to Participant 1’s study mean (21.62). Adverse signals (PSQI, slightly shorter sleep, small RHR elevation) are modest in magnitude and weighted lower by the provided correlations.
- Participant 2: Several convergent, high-weight indicators (severe GAD‑7 with very strong correlation to PSS, high PSQI, low self‑efficacy with strong inverse correlation, elevated resting HR/mesor, pain interference, abnormal sleep timing/duration) point toward substantially higher perceived stress relative to Participant 2’s study mean (21.12). Many of these indicators have larger effect sizes (Zs up to ≈+1.5) and/or higher correlations with PSS than the adverse signals in Participant 1.

Balance of evidence
- The evidence for elevated perceived stress is much stronger, more consistent across modalities, and composed of higher-weight predictors in Participant 2 than any signals pointing toward higher stress in Participant 1.

Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55) — a strong negative correlate of PSS — further predicts higher perceived stress.

- Nocturnal physiological arousal: pronounced night‑time heart‑rate elevations during typical sleep hours (several hourly deviations with positive correlations to PSS, e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.40), providing objective corroboration of nocturnal arousal linked to higher stress.
- Convergent multimodal pattern: self‑report and wearable signals point in the same (high‑stress) direction, and summary explicitly concludes PSS above the population mean (mean = 20.92).

Moderating/complicating factors (reduce certainty but do not outweigh above):
- Normal/low baseline cardiovascular indices (resting HR and MESOR slightly below mean) and several daytime low HR deviations that could reflect fitness, medication, or lifestyle rather than low stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their population frame)
- Some wearable and sleep indices that correlate modestly with PSS: subjective sleep quality mildly disturbed (PSQI = 6), late/variable sleep timing (median start ~01:27, sleep timing SD z ≈ +0.69), elevated intradaily variability/fragmentation (z ≈ +1.23), reduced interdaily stability and low 24‑h autocorrelation — these circadian/sleep irregularities are modestly positively correlated with PSS.

- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.48) and extremely short objective sleep (median ≈ 3 h 30 m; very large deviation). Short, poor sleep is strongly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) and pain–PSS correlation ≈ 0.5 — pain is a substantive stressor here.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (hourly Z up to ≈ +0.67 in late-night/early-morning windows) and reduced circadian robustness (amplitude Z ≈ -0.34, lower 24-h autocorrelation). Nocturnal physiological arousal relates positively with PSS (HR deviations r up to ≈ 0.43).
- Multiple different modalities (subjective sleep, objective sleep, pain, nocturnal physiology) converge on elevated stress-related signals.
- Counterpoints: low GAD-7 (4.5, Z ≈ -0.85; GAD–PSS r ≈ 0.77), high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86; r ≈ -0.64), and low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97; r ≈ 0.65) are strong protective signals that reduce certainty but, per the description, don’t fully offset the large sleep/pain/physiology abnormalities. The description explicitly infers ""above the population mean"" (population mean = 21.21).

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Mildly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, just above cutoff).
- Late and variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:27, sleep start SD high, z ≈ +0.69) and high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD z ≈ +1.0). These timing/variability indices correlate positively with PSS (r’s ≈ 0.14–0.17).
- Circadian irregularity/fragmentation: elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.23), low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.87), slight reduction in interdaily stability — these measures have modest positive correlations with PSS (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16).
- Hourly HR deviations with large afternoon/evening peaks (z > +2.0) and some early-night elevations; these hourly deviations have small positive correlations with PSS (up to ≈ 0.19).
- However, these are relatively modest risk signals in this sample compared with stronger protective self-report and physiological indices (see below). The description explicitly infers ""below the population mean"" (population mean = 21.62).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1 is characterized by multiple, large-magnitude abnormalities that are each moderately-to-strongly correlated with higher PSS in that study (severe subjective sleep disturbance, objectively very short sleep, elevated pain, nocturnal HR activation). Although some very strong protective self-report measures exist (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy), the clinical severity and multimodal convergence of the risk signals led the original synthesis to classify this person as above their sample mean (21.21).
- Participant 2 shows prominent protective shifts on core affective/trait self-reports (CES-D, STAI–Trait, Rosenberg, current happiness) with substantial z-score excursions toward lower-risk directions and moderate correlations with PSS. The wearable-derived risks (sleep timing variability, intradaily fragmentation, some HR peaks) are present but generally smaller in their sample-level correlations with PSS and/or smaller in absolute clinical severity than the risk signals seen in Participant 1.
- In short, Participant 1’s abnormalities are more severe and directly tied to PSS-relevant physiology/experience (especially sleep and pain), while Participant 2’s principal signals are protective and the risk indicators are milder and more circadian/variability-based with smaller sample correlations to PSS.

Overall judgment
- Based on the balance of evidence within each study’s frame, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (i.e., a PSS above their population mean), whereas Participant 2 is more likely below their population mean. Therefore Participant 1 likely has the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed), which correlates with higher PSS.
- Behavioral factors associated with stress risk: relatively frequent alcohol use (≈1–2×/week, z ≈ 1.0), high time spent on a sedentary hobby (z = 1.41), reduced self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ −0.73).
- Late median sleep start (~01:57 AM), which in student samples can reflect lifestyle/ arousal factors linked to greater perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety strongly predictive of PSS: GAD‑7 = 6 (mild) and GAD‑7 has very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78) — a high-leverage predictor.
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) with moderate-to-strong correlation with PSS (r = 0.49).
- Pain-related interference (PEG ≈ 6.78; PAPAS z ≈ 0.24) with moderate correlations to PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Objective circadian/sleep disruption: low interdaily stability (z = −0.68), low 24h autocorrelation (z = −0.35), and very high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 273 min, z = 1.7) — patterns commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.54) which can elevate perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Both descriptions conclude the participant is around or modestly above their respective study mean, but the strength and predictive power of the signals differ.
- Participant 1’s self-report stress-related elevations are modest (small positive z-scores) and the self-report measures that link to PSS in that sample have only modest correlations (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Conversely, Participant 1 shows several relatively large protective/resilience indicators from wearables and behavior (interdaily stability, autocorrelation, amplitude z ≈ 1.0–1.25; exercise z > 1; sleep duration stability z ≈ −1.5; low resting HR), which are associated with lower PSS.
- Participant 2 exhibits multiple risk indicators that are either strongly correlated with PSS or have large effect-size deviations: notably GAD‑7’s high correlation with PSS (r = 0.78) and very poor PSQI (13), plus very large sleep variability (z = 1.7). Although Participant 2 has meaningful protective factors (self‑efficacy r = −0.65 and low substance problems), those protections are smaller in magnitude (z = 0.3 for self‑efficacy) or relate less directly to the strongest positive predictors present (anxiety, poor sleep, pain, circadian irregularity).
- Net assessment: Participant 1’s modest self-report risks are substantially counterbalanced (and arguably outweighed) by robust objective resilience indicators. Participant 2’s profile contains several strong, concordant predictors of higher perceived stress (including at least one very highly predictive variable — GAD‑7), and a large objective disruption in sleep regularity, which together provide stronger evidence of elevated PSS relative to that study’s mean.

- Clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r = 0.48), so this is a relevant risk signal.
- Very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) and large variability in sleep timing, both associated with higher perceived stress.
- Substantial nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (z > 1; 1–2 AM deviation r ≈ 0.46 with PSS), indicating nocturnal arousal that correlates with higher PSS.
- Together these sleep/nocturnal physiology signals are the strongest indicators within this profile that would push inferred PSS upward.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study population frame)
- Modest elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, z = 0.38) and trait anxiety (STAI z = 0.17); both positively correlate with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Behavioral/contextual risk factors: higher-than-average alcohol use, high time spent in a sedentary hobby, reduced self‑esteem, and very late median sleep start (~01:57 AM)—all of which can be linked to greater perceived stress.
- These self-report and lifestyle indicators collectively point toward somewhat elevated perceived stress (though each effect is modest).

Comparative weighing (explicitly within each participant’s population frame)
- Participant 1: The strongest signals in their profile are large protective effects from trait measures (very low GAD-7, high self‑efficacy). Those measures have large correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ −0.65), and so carry substantial weight toward inferring below‑mean PSS. Sleep and nocturnal physiology indicators that argue for higher PSS have moderate correlations (≈0.46–0.48) and therefore are weaker predictors than the trait measures. The provided integration explicitly concludes Participant 1 is likely below the population mean (21.21).
- Participant 2: Several self-report measures and lifestyle markers show small-to-moderate elevations that point toward higher PSS, and subjective sleep disturbance is present. Although objective wearable signals (strong circadian regularity, low RHR, consistent sleep duration, frequent exercise) are protective and relatively robust, the study summary judged the net inference as near the population mean and possibly slightly above it (population mean 21.62). The psychological elevations are smaller in magnitude than Participant 1’s protective trait signals, but they are multiple and align toward higher stress.

Conclusion
- Participant 1 is inferred to be below their study mean PSS; Participant 2 is inferred to be near or slightly above their study mean PSS.
- Therefore, Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

16,11402,23,21,"Reasons Participant 1 might have higher PSS
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 54, Z = 1.25), a relatively strong survey predictor of higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z ≈ 0.38), which also correlate with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:17; sleep-start SD ≈ 135 min, Z ≈ 1.14), which in this cohort is positively associated with PSS.  
- Elevated basal cardiovascular tone (MESOR Z ≈ 1.30; resting HR Z ≈ 0.62) and an evening activation peak — physiological patterns that align with higher perceived stress.  
- The report explicitly concludes the participant’s inferred PSS is above their study population mean (21.62).

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 12) and a strong PSQI–PSS correlation in the sample (r ≈ 0.50).  
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ 0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.65), indicating mood instability that can drive perceived stress.  
- Marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations (night-hour deviations +10.24, +7.34, +4.18 bpm) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), plus elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ 1.37 and 1.18).  
- Very long median sleep duration (12 h, Z ≈ 2.26) and large night-to-night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 2.38) — notable dysregulation that can be associated with stress-related problems (though these wearable-duration metrics have weak direct correlations with PSS in the sample).

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own population mean. Participant 1’s summary explicitly infers PSS above the population mean (21.62) based chiefly on elevated trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, late/irregular sleep timing, and elevated basal cardiovascular tone; protective signals (good PSQI, high self‑esteem, low IV) were judged insufficient to offset risk.  
- Participant 2 shows several domain-specific risk signals (high PSQI, emotional lability with a strong PSS correlation, nocturnal HR elevation, elevated resting HR), but also multiple comparatively strong protective signals (low pain burden, good interpersonal functioning, only mild anxiety). The summary concludes P2 is best characterized as near the population mean (20.96), possibly modestly elevated in some domains but not clearly above the mean overall.
- Although some P2 indicators (emotional lability correlation with PSS, nocturnal HR spikes, high resting HR) are individually compelling, the presence of several strong protective factors and the author’s final inference that overall PSS is near the population mean reduce the weight of those risks in a global judgment relative to peers.
- In contrast, Participant 1’s risk indicators (notably trait anxiety and sleep-timing irregularity) are presented as stronger overall contributors to above-average perceived stress in that cohort.

6,11402,20,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 54, Z = 1.25) — STAI is positively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31) and is described as one of the strongest survey-based predictors here.  
- Modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 17, Z = 0.38) — CES‑D correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28) and compounds anxiety risk.  
- Very late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:17; sleep-start SD Z ≈ 1.14) — sleep-timing irregularity is positively associated with PSS (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.17).  
- Modestly elevated basal cardiovascular tone (resting HR Z ≈ 0.62; MESOR Z ≈ 1.30) — small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14 and 0.06) suggest some physiologic arousal consistent with higher stress.  
- Evening‑biased activation with circadian misalignment (late sleep onset + evening HR elevation) — literature and dataset-level associations link misalignment to higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Moderate anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 10) — in this dataset GAD‑7 has a very large positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.77), making it a strong predictor of higher perceived stress.  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5) — PSQI strongly correlated with PSS here (r = 0.49) and is a direct contributor to perceived stress.  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 score 9.67; z ≈ 0.93) — this measure correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.67) and indicates difficulty regulating affect.  
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE = 27; z ≈ −0.62) — NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.66), so lower self‑efficacy predicts higher stress.  
- Pain interference and somatic burden (PEG‑3 ≈ 5.0; r ≈ 0.44) — these are associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Wearable indicators of physiological activation and sleep disruption (resting HR Z ≈ 1.31; MESOR Z ≈ 1.19; large night‑to‑night sleep variability Z ≈ 1.12) — these align with elevated arousal and disrupted restorative processes and have at least modest links to PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the strength and number of high‑relevance predictors differ. Participant 1’s strongest predictors (trait anxiety, CES‑D, late/irregular sleep) are meaningful but their sample-level correlations with PSS are modest (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; sleep timing r ≈ 0.17). Participant 1 also has several protective signals (good self‑reported sleep quality PSQI = 5, high self‑esteem, low intradaily variability) that temper the inference.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple self-report predictors that have large sample‑level correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.77, BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.67, NGSE r ≈ −0.66, PSQI r ≈ 0.49). These are direct, strongly correlated measures tied to perceived stress and are accompanied by supporting wearable signals (high resting HR/MESOR, high sleep variability). Although some wearable rhythm metrics are mixed and there are modest resilience signals (7 hr median sleep, low IV), the number and strength of self‑report indicators strongly favor higher PSS for Participant 2 relative to their cohort.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 has a denser cluster of high‑relevance, strongly correlated predictors of perceived stress (especially anxiety severity, very poor PSQI, emotional lability, and low self‑efficacy). Participant 1 has important risk indicators but they are fewer, have weaker sample correlations to PSS, and are partially offset by notable protective signals. The study population means are similar (21.62 vs 21.08), so population baseline differences do not materially change the comparative inference.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”; Z ≈ +0.59) — subjective poor sleep is commonly linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Late and highly variable sleep timing/duration: median sleep start ≈ 01:35 AM with high night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ +1.27; sleep duration SD Z ≈ +1.55); variability correlates modestly with higher PSS in the sample.  
- Modestly lower momentary happiness (current happiness Z ≈ -0.53), consistent with some psychosocial strain.  
- Small physiological signals of strain: resting HR slightly above average (61.4 bpm, Z ≈ +0.39) and some early-morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (small magnitudes).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Strong, convergent self-report indicators: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16, Z ≈ +1.16; large r with PSS), very high PSQI (15; Z ≈ +0.5), high pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.18), and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z ≈ +1.23). Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.55) further predicts higher perceived stress.  
- Extreme sleep/circadian disruption: median sleep ~2 h 58 m (Z ≈ -0.82), very late median sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.3), low interdaily stability and low amplitude (Zs around -0.23 to -1.4) — these wearable-derived patterns are strongly associated with higher PSS in the sample.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: marked positive hourly HR deviations during typical sleep hours (e.g., 1–2am deviation z ≈ +1.18) with these deviations correlating positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40).  
- Multiple high-magnitude z-scores and strong correlations with PSS across instruments produce convergent evidence for above-mean perceived stress.

Within-population framing and comparative weighing
- Each description is referenced to its own sample mean. Participant 1’s integrated inference was “near the population mean (21.62), leaning modestly below,” i.e., no clear above-mean signal and several protective factors (low depression/trait-anxiety, high self-esteem, strong circadian stability, regular exercise, long median sleep ~8h13m, strong rhythm metrics) that counterbalance the subjective sleep complaints. Overall P1’s risk indicators are moderate and mixed.  
- Participant 2’s integrated inference was explicitly “above the study population mean (20.92),” supported by multiple large, convergent signals (severe anxiety, extreme short/late sleep, high intradaily variability, nocturnal HR elevations, low self-efficacy). Many z-scores for P2 are of larger magnitude and the measures most strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (e.g., GAD-7) are highly elevated. Although P2 has a few moderating signs (resting HR slightly below mean, some daytime low HR periods), these do not outweigh the substantial self-report and wearable evidence of distress and nocturnal arousal.

Conclusion — overall likelihood of higher perceived stress
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population) than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.

- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83), with PSQI also strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.51).
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), a strong inverse correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.66).

- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (resting HR 79.8 bpm, Z = 1.53; mesor Z = 1.49), indicating sustained physiological arousal.
- Very short wearable-recorded median sleep (2 h 31 min) and late/highly variable sleep timing; subjective report supports substantial sleep disturbance.
- Emotional/functional difficulties on symptom scales and some substance-related elevations on BASIS‑24.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each summary is relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.62; P2 mean = 21.12). Participant 1’s synthesis explicitly concludes their PSS is near the population mean, leaning modestly below it, driven by strong protective circadian and behavioral markers (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, long median sleep, low depression/trait‑anxiety, high self‑esteem, regular exercise). The risk signals for P1 are present but modest in magnitude.
- Participant 2’s synthesis explicitly concludes their PSS is above the population mean, driven by multiple high-weight indicators (severe anxiety, very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy, pain interference, elevated resting HR). Many of these features have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 and NGSE), making them especially predictive of higher perceived stress in that study.
- Magnitude and weight of indicators favor Participant 2: P2 shows several large, concordant, high-correlation markers of stress (severe anxiety, very poor sleep, elevated physiology), whereas P1 shows mostly modest risk indicators counterbalanced or outweighed by several robust protective factors.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 more clearly and consistently exhibits features associated with higher perceived stress relative to their study sample mean than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.
- Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to have the higher PSS.

- Daytime arousal and behaviors: Large late-afternoon HR deviation (4–5pm Z = 2.06) and higher internet use (3–4 hr/day, Z ≈ 1.52) that can accompany elevated perceived stress.

Several of these measures are described as having strong correlations with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7).  
- Participant 2 has some risk indicators (trait anxiety, sleep/circadian irregularity, afternoon HR peak), but these are generally described as more modest, and are balanced by a larger set of protective factors (high health satisfaction, happiness, self-esteem, regular exercise, very low resting HR, good GPA). The reported correlations of Participant 2’s primary risk measures with PSS are smaller than those highlighted for Participant 1.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Given that Participant 1 is described as above their population mean with multiple strong, PSS-correlated risk factors (including clinical-range anxiety and disturbed sleep) and physiological night-time arousal that aligns with PSS in that sample, while Participant 2 is characterized as near their population mean with mixed signals and substantial protective factors, the preponderance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

Protective/offsetting factors (substantial): high health satisfaction and momentary happiness (z ≈ 1.05 and z ≈ 0.55), high self‑esteem (RSES = 38), frequent exercise (z ≈ 1.07), low resting HR and greater HR amplitude (cardio fitness signals, resting HR z ≈ -1.27; amplitude z ≈ 0.58), minimal substance use, good academic performance. Overall description: inferred near the sample mean (population mean 21.61), with only a modest tilt toward elevated stress on some measures.

- Both profiles show mixed risk/protective signals, but the balance and strength of the risk indicators differ. Participant 1 shows multiple high‑impact indicators strongly associated with PSS in their sample: particularly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) and anxiety with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (GAD r = 0.78), plus large objective sleep variability (z ≈ 1.7) and pain interference. These are noted as the most predictive features in the P1 description and the text explicitly infers P1 is slightly above their population mean (21.04).  
- Participant 2 has some risk signals (trait anxiety, sleep variability, circadian instability), but these are generally weaker predictors in the provided correlations and are counterbalanced by several robust protective markers (low resting HR, high self‑esteem, frequent exercise, high health satisfaction). The summary explicitly places P2 near their population mean (21.61) with only a modest lean toward elevated stress.  
- Comparing the two within their respective frames: P1’s description emphasizes several strong, directly predictive correlates of higher PSS and explicitly concludes “slightly above” the population mean. P2’s description emphasizes protective resources that likely keep P2 close to the mean despite some risk signs.

- Robust protective psychosocial indicators: low depression (CES-D z = -0.66), low trait anxiety (STAI z = -0.82), high self-esteem and elevated momentary happiness (current happiness z = 1.64).
- Healthy lifestyle and fitness markers: low resting HR and MESOR (resting HR z = -1.49; MESOR z = -2.13), regular social/structured exercise (z = 1.23), limited substance use, good academic performance and health satisfaction — all factors that predict lower perceived stress.
- Adequate median sleep duration (~7 h 24 m, z = 0.28) and infrequent naps — these likely buffer stress despite reported subjective sleep disturbance.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Participant 1’s elevated predictors are both numerous and include variables with strong correlations to PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 and low self-efficacy), plus physiological corroboration (very short, late sleep and nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS). Several metrics are extreme relative to their sample (e.g., median sleep ≈3 hours, intradaily variability z ≈ 1.3), supporting an inference of PSS above that population mean.
- Participant 2’s risk signals (sleep fragmentation, variability, intradaily variability) exist but are weaker predictors in magnitude and partly offset by multiple strong protective factors (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, fitness, adequate median sleep). The summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely near the population mean PSS rather than clearly above it.
- Both participants’ population mean PSS scores are similar (~21), but the evidence for elevated PSS relative to their own cohorts is markedly stronger and more convergent for Participant 1 than for Participant 2.

The description explicitly concludes P2 is above their study mean. The magnitude and number of elevated risk variables for P2 are larger and more strongly tied to PSS than the elevated risk variables for P1.
- Population mean PSS values are similar (21.61 vs 21.04), so absolute mean differences are negligible; the appropriate comparison is which participant’s within-cohort predictors point more strongly above their respective mean. By that metric, P2 shows stronger, more numerous predictors of elevated perceived stress than P1.

- Late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start 02:24) and reduced circadian amplitude / greater rhythm fragmentation (interdaily stability low, intradaily variability elevated). Circadian disruption is linked to greater stress burden.
- Modestly elevated resting heart rate (66.8 bpm, Z = 1.03) and some daytime HR elevation, suggesting increased autonomic arousal or poorer recovery.

- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10). In this sample GAD-7 shows a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), making this a powerful indicator of higher perceived stress.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Elevated pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86), which correlate moderately with PSS (~0.45–0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9), which is strongly associated with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.66).
- Wearable indicators consistent with stress risk: very short median sleep (3 h 55 m), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −1.51), and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.75). These physiological markers modestly associate with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1: although there are clear objective physiological risk signals (very short sleep, circadian fragmentation, elevated resting HR), the participant’s self-report emotional profile is strongly protective (low depressive symptoms CES-D = 4; low trait anxiety STAI-T = 25; high self‑esteem and happiness). In this study many wearable/physiological markers have only modest correlations with PSS (e.g., resting HR r ≈ 0.14; amplitude/stability correlations are small-to-modest). The subjective indicators that most directly map onto perceived stress are favorable, so the integrated inference in the participant’s own study was near-to-slightly-below the population mean (21.62).
- Participant 2: multiple strong self-report predictors of higher PSS are elevated simultaneously (clinically meaningful anxiety with very high correlation to PSS, severe subjective sleep disturbance, pain interference, and high emotional lability). These measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; PSQI r ≈ 0.49; pain ~0.45–0.49), so their co-occurrence provides robust evidence for above-mean perceived stress. Protective factors (high self-efficacy, lower interpersonal difficulty, lower resting HR) are present but do not outweigh the strong risk signals.

Balance of evidence
- The weight and strength of predictors favor Participant 2 as having higher perceived stress. Participant 2’s profile contains several high-impact self-report measures that are strongly correlated with PSS in their cohort (especially GAD-7 and emotional lability), plus poor subjective sleep and pain. Participant 1’s risk signals are primarily physiological/behavioral with smaller correlations to PSS, while their self-reported mood and psychosocial resources strongly point toward lower perceived distress. Both descriptions explicitly infer Participant 2 above their study mean and Participant 1 near/slightly below theirs.

15,82986,15,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; PSQI correlates with PSS in this sample r ≈ 0.53) — large positive signal for higher perceived stress.  
- High pain / functional interference (PAPAS = 81; PAPAS–PSS r ≈ 0.53) — another strong subjective predictor of higher PSS.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62; NGSE–PSS r ≈ -0.69) — a strong inverse correlate, so below-average NGSE points to higher PSS.  
- Elevated nocturnal heart rate and higher mesor/resting HR (night HR deviations Zs ≥ 0.55–1.38; mesor Z = 0.7; RHR Z = 0.61) — physiological signals that in this sample show moderate positive correlations with PSS (HR-night correlations r ≈ 0.31–0.47).  
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83) — less regular daily timing, modestly linked to higher PSS in this dataset.  
- Integrated profile description explicitly concludes PSS likely above the population mean (21.29).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very short sleep (median 5 h 6 min; Z = -2.6) and late sleep timing (median start 02:24) — objectively strong indicators that can increase perceived stress.  
- PSQI = 6 (subjective disturbed sleep).  
- Circadian fragmentation / reduced amplitude (interdaily stability Z = -0.66; intradaily variability Z = 0.46; amplitude Z = -1.04) — objective rhythm disruption associated with stress risk.  
- Elevated resting heart rate (66.8 bpm, Z = 1.03), MESOR elevated (Z = 0.79) — modest physiologic signals of arousal.  
- Note: the summary qualifies that these objective markers could elevate perceived stress over time even though correlations with PSS in this sample are modest.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is characterized primarily by subjective measures (poor sleep quality, high pain, low self‑efficacy) that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (multiple r values ≈ 0.5–0.7) plus corroborating nocturnal HR elevations (moderate HR–PSS correlations). The integrated conclusion for this participant is explicitly that their PSS is above their population mean (21.29).  
- Participant 2 shows a pronounced objective-risk profile (severe sleep restriction, circadian disruption, higher RHR), but their subjective self-report measures (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness) are strongly protective and the summary infers PSS near or slightly below that study’s mean (21.62). Importantly, many of Participant 2’s wearable–PSS associations are described as modest in this sample, whereas Participant 1’s strongest predictors are measures that correlate more strongly with PSS in their sample.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1’s elevated PSS inference rests on multiple high-correlation subjective measures (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE) plus corroborating physiological signals with moderate correlations to PSS. Those are direct, convergent indicators of higher perceived stress relative to their study population.  
- Participant 2 has clear objective risk (severe short sleep and circadian disruption), but these objective markers are counterbalanced by strong, low self‑report distress and psychosocial resources; the study summary infers PSS near/slightly below the population mean, and many wearable–PSS links are only modest.  
- Because PSS is a subjective measure and Participant 1’s profile combines both strong subjective risk signals (with high sample correlations) and supportive physiological markers, while Participant 2’s subjective profile is protective despite objective risk, the overall weight of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

20,79395,21,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have higher PSS
- Strong elevations on depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 32; z ≈ +1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI = 54; z ≈ +1.25), both known to covary with PSS in this sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32).
- Low self‑esteem and low current happiness (z’s ≈ −1.85 and −1.61) and PSQI > 5 (score = 6) indicating subjective sleep disturbance—these map onto higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral/physiological signs of evening arousal: late sleep onset (~01:21 AM) and elevated evening heart rate (notable 9–11 PM deviations) that can accompany increased perceived stress.
- Slightly above‑average alcohol use (z ≈ +1.0) that could reflect coping-related use under stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS / buffers
- Strongly regular circadian/wake patterns (interdaily stability and 24 h autocorrelation z’s ≈ +1.15) and low intradaily variability—markers linked to lower stress vulnerability.
- Adequate average sleep duration (~7 h 15 m; z ≈ +0.09) with low night‑to‑night variability, low resting HR (z ≈ −0.17), frequent group exercise (z ≈ +1.23), and low drug use. These are plausible resilience factors that reduce the likelihood or impact of very high PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) and very strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77) — a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13.5) with a substantial correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49) and objectively short median sleep (≈3 h 55 m), both linked to increased perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS) and high emotional lability (BASIS‑24), each with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (≈0.45–0.66).
- Blunted circadian amplitude (z ≈ −1.51) and reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.75), consistent with higher stress risk.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS / buffers
- High general self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +1.41) with a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.68), a substantial protective factor.
- Relatively low interpersonal problems (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z ≈ −1.27) and low resting HR/mesor (z’s ≈ −0.9, −1.4), which may buffer perceived stress physiologically.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Participant 1’s strongest signals for higher PSS are elevated depression and trait anxiety, but those predictors in this cohort have only small‑to‑moderate correlations with PSS. Importantly, multiple objective/resilience markers (strong circadian regularity, adequate sleep duration, frequent group exercise) argue against extreme elevation above the sample mean.
- Participant 2 shows elevations on several measures that have larger, more direct associations with PSS in that cohort (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77, emotional lability r ≈ 0.66, PSQI r ≈ 0.49, pain measures r ≈ 0.45–0.49). Those risk indicators are both clinically meaningful and statistically strongly linked to perceived stress in this sample. Although Participant 2 has strong protective self‑efficacy, the number and strength of risk signals (anxiety + severe sleep disturbance + pain + emotional lability + circadian blunting) are substantial.

Conclusion / weighted judgment
- Taking into account (a) the magnitude and number of risk indicators, (b) how strongly those indicators correlate with PSS within each cohort, and (c) the presence of resilience factors, Participant 2’s profile contains multiple high‑impact predictors of perceived stress (including a GAD score tightly linked to PSS) that outweigh their protective self‑efficacy. Participant 1 shows marked subjective distress but also several objective resilience markers and predictors that in this sample are less strongly associated with PSS than the key predictors elevated in Participant 2.

18,79395,18,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Marked elevations on self-report mood measures that are positively associated with PSS in this sample: CES‑D = 32 (z ≈ +1.95) and STAI = 54 (z ≈ +1.25). These are direct indicators of negative affect and anxiety that typically increase perceived stress.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ −1.85) and low current happiness (z ≈ −1.61) further support elevated subjective distress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and late habitual sleep onset (~01:21 AM) plus evening heart‑rate elevation (notable positive deviations 9–11 PM) that may reflect evening physiological arousal.
- Slightly elevated alcohol use (z ≈ +1.0) that could reflect coping behavior in higher‑stress contexts.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 14.5, z ≈ 0.9) where GAD‑7 has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.80) — a potent predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) and extreme objective sleep disruption: median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 19 m (z ≈ −1.04), very late median sleep onset (≈ 02:49 AM) and large start‑time SD (z ≈ +1.16). Sleep measures here have moderate associations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.49).
- Strong physiological/arousal indicators tied to PSS: high resting HR (81.2 bpm, z ≈ +1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (z ≈ −1.57), low interdaily stability (z ≈ −1.34), high intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.23), and marked nocturnal HR elevations (~+8–9 bpm around midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24) and pain/interference measures that also show positive associations with PSS.
- Protective factor: modestly higher self‑efficacy (z ≈ +0.12), but this appears small relative to the many adverse signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are very large subjective mood/depression and anxiety scores (CES‑D z ≈ +1.95; STAI z ≈ +1.25). However, those measures (CES‑D, STAI) have only modest sample correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.29–0.32), and multiple objective/behavioral resilience indicators (good sleep duration ≈7h15m, high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, low resting HR, frequent group exercise) reduce the likelihood that subjective distress translates into a very high PSS relative to this sample.
- Participant 2 shows a convergence of strong predictors that, in this sample, have higher correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80, emotional lability r ≈ 0.66, PSQI r ≈ 0.49). Crucially, Participant 2’s objective physiology and sleep are markedly disrupted (extremely short sleep, high resting HR, nocturnal HR elevations, flattened rhythm, high IV/low IS), and many of these features have substantive positive associations with PSS in the cohort. Those convergent subjective and objective signals point toward a more severe elevation in perceived stress relative to Participant 2’s study mean.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Although Participant 1 has very high depressive and anxiety self‑reports, the weaker sample‑level correlations of those measures with PSS and the presence of multiple robust objective resilience factors make it less likely that Participant 1’s PSS is as high as Participant 2’s.
- Participant 2 presents multiple, converging high‑correlation indicators of perceived stress (strong GAD‑PSS link), severe objective sleep deprivation/irregularity, and pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal — a profile that plausibly maps to a higher PSS relative to their sample mean than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.

- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE below mean; r = -0.66 with PSS) and moderate pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS; r ≈ 0.44–0.48), both linked to higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ +1.5), consistent with sustained physiological arousal associated with stress.
- Emotional lability and some interpersonal/substance-related elevations that co-occur with higher stress in the cohort.
- Multiple converging high-weight indicators (anxiety + poor sleep + low self-efficacy + physiological arousal) point to above‑mean PSS in this participant.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated mean daily naps (0.25/day; Z = +2.07), which in this cohort has a modest positive correlation with PSS.
- Some intradaily variability and sleep-duration variability (small positive z-scores) that are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Limited socializing time (z ≈ -1.41), which could reduce social buffering.
- Pronounced evening heart‑rate deviations (hourly z up to ≈ +2.37), possibly reflecting delayed recovery or evening arousal (though weakly correlated with PSS in the sample).
- These risk signals are present but are smaller in magnitude and weaker predictors of PSS in this cohort than the strong negative indicators below.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Participant 1: Strong, multiple, and highly PSS‑related indicators (severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, low self‑efficacy, pain, elevated resting HR) all point toward PSS substantially above their population mean (21.12). Protective signals are modest and do not offset the high‑weight features.
- Participant 2: Majority of high‑weight indicators point toward PSS below their population mean (21.62): low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, very good subjective sleep, long objective sleep, very low resting HR/mesor (likely fitness), regular circadian measures, high health satisfaction. The signals that could raise PSS are smaller in effect size and only modestly correlated with PSS in this cohort.

Conclusion
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

7,23287,15,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence suggesting above‑mean perceived stress):
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; z = 0.67; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), and PSQI in this dataset correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = 0.89) and sleep onset time (SD = 204 min; z = 0.34) — poor and irregular sleep are well‑established correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 Interpersonal Relationships = 17.67; z = 2.34), a salient contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress even if that subscale correlates weakly with PSS in the sample.
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24‑h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude, blunted HR circadian amplitude z ≈ -0.84), plus evening HR elevations and fragmented sleep — patterns that commonly co‑occur with elevated perceived stress or difficulty coping.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not markedly higher) PSS (protective evidence to consider):
- Minimal current anxiety (GAD‑7 = 1.5; z = -1.38), low pain and pain interference (PEG‑3 low; PAPAS composite z = -1.29), and low emotional lability (z = -1.27).
- Near‑average self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.07), and in this sample higher self‑efficacy strongly predicts lower PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Lower resting heart rate and MESOR (RHR ≈ 59 bpm; MESOR ≈ 64 bpm) consistent with lower tonic arousal in many contexts.
- Holistic summary in their study: near the population mean with a modest tilt toward above the mean (population mean = 21.29).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence suggesting above‑mean perceived stress, if any):
- Some modest signs associated with higher PSS in the cohort: slightly elevated intradaily variability (z = 0.17) and sleep duration variability (SD z = 0.67).
- Elevated nap frequency/mean daily naps (0.25 naps/day; z = 2.07), and nap frequency has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.15).
- Limited time socializing with friends (16–30 min; z = -1.41), which could reduce social buffering.
- Higher daily internet use (3–4 hours; z = 1.52) which has a small positive correlation with PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.11).
- Pronounced evening heart‑rate deviations (large positive deviations around 9–11 pm; z up to ~2.37) that can reflect delayed recovery or evening arousal in some individuals (though these hourly deviations are weakly correlated with PSS overall).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (evidence suggesting below‑mean perceived stress):
- Strong protective/self‑report indicators: low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 6; z = -0.76), low trait anxiety (STAI z = -0.43), good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 3; z = -1.72), and high health satisfaction (z = 1.71).
- Long median nightly sleep (8 h 23 min; z = 1.49) and modest sleep timing variability, supporting better recovery.
- Very low resting HR and mesor (z ≈ -2.1 to -2.2), interpreted here as good cardiovascular fitness rather than stress‑related suppression.
- Reasonably consistent circadian timing (interdaily stability z = 0.33; autocorrelation z = 0.48), low substance use, frequent group exercise (z = 1.23).
- Holistic summary in their study: profile is below the population mean (population mean = 21.62), with countervailing risk signals judged smaller in magnitude.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame:
- Participant 1 is described as close to their study’s central tendency but with a “modest tilt” toward above‑mean PSS; key high‑weight indicators pointing above the mean are strong: markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI) that itself correlates moderately with PSS in this sample, objectively very short and highly variable sleep, and marked interpersonal strain (z = 2.34).
- Participant 2 is explicitly described as below their study’s mean PSS, with several strong protective markers (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, very good subjective and objective sleep, low RHR interpreted as fitness, regular circadian measures). The risk signals for Participant 2 are present but smaller in magnitude and have only modest correlations with PSS in the cohort.

Balancing the evidence:
- Participant 1 has multiple moderate-to-strong indicators that align with higher perceived stress relative to their cohort (notably disturbed sleep and interpersonal strain) and is explicitly judged “near the mean with a modest tilt toward being above the mean.”

- Very short objective sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 4 h 22 min — a large deviation from typical restorative sleep and a strong stress correlate.
- High night-to-night variability and irregular timing: sleep duration SD = 216 min (z = 0.89) and sleep onset SD = 204 min (z = 0.34), plus low interdaily stability and reduced circadian amplitude — all consistent with weakened behavioral structure that tends to accompany higher perceived stress.
- Elevated interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships score z = 2.34 (substantially above the sample mean), a contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress.

Protective/contraindicating signals for Participant 1 (for balance)
- Very low current anxiety (GAD-7 = 1.5, z = -1.38), low pain, low emotional lability (z ≈ -1.27) and near-average self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.07).
- Lower resting HR and MESOR relative to the sample (consistent with lower tonic arousal in many contexts).
- Holistic summary in the description: overall near the sample mean with a modest tilt above it (not an extreme outlier).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.64)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (z ≈ 0.59), meeting common threshold for disturbed sleep that often associates with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (0.68, z = 0.95) and pronounced hourly HR deviations at specific times (notably 12–1 pm, 1–2 pm, and 10–11 pm with z = 2.11–3.14) suggesting episodic physiological arousal that can relate to increased perceived stress.
- Some reduction in momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which modestly correlates with higher PSS in the sample.

Protective/contraindicating signals for Participant 2
- Robustly low trait symptomatology: CES-D = 4 (z = -0.97) and STAI-Trait = 28 (z = -1.31).
- High self-esteem (RSES z = 1.66) and strong psychosocial functioning (high GPA).
- Objective sleep is excellent and regular: median sleep ≈ 8 h 14 min (z = 1.31) with low night-to-night variability (z = -1.15).
- Low resting HR and above-average interdaily stability (z = 0.67).
- Holistic summary in the description: overall the balance favors PSS below the population mean (some episodic arousal but stronger protective signals).

Comparative within-population reasoning
- Each profile is written relative to its own study mean. Participant 1’s description explicitly concludes the participant is likely near the population mean with a modest tilt above it; key drivers are severe objective short sleep, large sleep variability, circadian irregularity, and marked interpersonal strain (some of these effects have large z-scores, e.g., interpersonal z = 2.34 and extreme short sleep).
- Participant 2’s description explicitly concludes the participant is likely below their population mean: many strong protective signals (low depression/anxiety trait scores, high self-esteem, long and regular objective sleep, low resting HR, good circadian stability). The adverse signals for Participant 2 are mainly subjective sleep complaints and episodic HR peaks, but these are weighed as weaker/more episodic than the strong trait- and objective-based protections.
- Both participants have some conflicting signals, but the magnitude and number of stress-related risk indicators are greater and more consistent for Participant 1 relative to their population mean than for Participant 2 relative to theirs. Notably, Participant 1’s objectively very short sleep and high interpersonal strain are stronger, more chronic-seeming risk factors than Participant 2’s intermittent HR peaks and modest subjective sleep complaint.

Weighted conclusion
- On balance, Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (i.e., higher PSS relative to their respective study mean) than Participant 2.

- Wearable sleep metrics that align with disturbed sleep (median recorded sleep 1 h 44 min, highly variable sleep start times). Even allowing for possible non-wear, the objective signal reinforces the subjective sleep problem and thus supports higher inferred PSS.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 7.78, PAPAS 78.0; Z ≈ +0.7–0.8). Pain/interference correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), so they are substantive contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with episodic arousal overnight (midnight–early morning deviations), which have modest positive correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Summary statement explicitly frames this participant as “near the mean” but possibly modestly above the mean due to sleep disturbance and pain — i.e., the written inference already tilts mildly upward.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; Z ≈ +0.59), which is associated with higher PSS even when objective sleep duration is adequate.
- Elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate (IV z ≈ +0.95), which modestly correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.17) and suggests more within-day fragmentation.
- Pronounced hourly HR peaks at specific daytime and late-evening hours (notably large z-scores around midday and 10–11 pm) that could reflect episodic physiological arousal with weak positive associations to PSS.
- Slightly muted momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which is associated with higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both descriptions are written relative to their own study populations and the population mean PSS values are almost identical (21.50 vs 21.64), so cross-study baseline differences are minimal and a direct comparative inference is reasonable.
- Participant 1’s upward signals are dominated by two relatively strong, well-correlated predictors of PSS in that sample: very poor subjective sleep (PSQI) and elevated pain/interference. Those predictors have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS and are both notably elevated (Z ≈ +0.7–0.8 for pain; PSQI high).
- Participant 2 has some signals that could raise PSS (subjective PSQI, intradaily variability, episodic HR peaks), but the major, high-weight indicators in that participant are protective: low trait depression and anxiety (CES-D and STAI-Trait Z ≈ -1), high self-esteem (RSES z ≈ +1.66), objectively long and consistent sleep (median ~8h14, z ≈ +1.31; low night-to-night variability), and low resting HR. These protective signals are large in magnitude and described as dominating the overall inference (participant concluded likely below the mean).
- Participant 1’s profile is explicitly characterized as “near the mean” with a modest upward shift due primarily to sleep and pain; Participant 2’s profile is explicitly characterized as “below the mean” with only episodic/smaller countervailing signals.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 1: Clear, high-weight risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance and pain/interference) that are strongly/ moderately correlated with PSS in their sample, producing a modest elevation relative to their cohort mean.
- Participant 2: Predominantly protective indicators (low trait symptoms, high self-esteem, objectively strong and regular sleep, low RHR), with smaller, more circumscribed signals of episodic arousal; the integrated interpretation in that report is that participant is below their population mean PSS.
- Given similar population means and the relative magnitudes/correlations of risk vs protective signals in each report, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress.

- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8.5 (well above the clinical cutoff >5) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 mean 8.33 and PAPAS Z = 1.21; pain measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS (PEG-3 r ≈ 0.43; PAPAS r ≈ 0.47).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large nighttime HR deviations (midnight–2am increases of ~+14 bpm; Z ≈ 1.25–1.36) that are positively associated with PSS (correlations up to ≈ 0.40).  
- Sleep timing variability/fragmentation: High night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 199 min, Z ≈ 0.65), which can exacerbate perceived stress.  
- (Counterpoints noted in summary) There are protective features (higher self-efficacy, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR, low substance use), but the strongest, highly correlated survey and nocturnal arousal indicators favor above-mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from the description)
- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 7 (clinically disturbed sleep), late median sleep start (~01:05 AM) and substantial start-time variability (SD ≈ 93 min), which typically co-occur with higher perceived stress.  
- Reduced positive affect / satisfaction: Happiness Z ≈ -0.53 and health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.45 — modest declines in positive affect that can accompany stress.  
- Early-morning HR deviations: Small positive correlations with PSS around 3–6 AM (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), indicating minor physiological signals that align with higher PSS in some individuals.  
- (Counterpoints noted in summary) However, these stress-related signals are relatively modest and are counterbalanced by multiple strong protective indicators.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Strength and number of risk indicators: Participant 1 has multiple, moderately-to-strongly predictive survey signals (clinically meaningful GAD-7, high PSQI, elevated pain/interference) that are stated to correlate substantially with PSS in that sample. Participant 1 also shows pronounced nocturnal HR elevations that have nontrivial correlations with PSS. These are high-leverage indicators pointing above the population mean.  
- Participant 2’s stress-consistent signals (PSQI = 7, late/variable sleep timing, lower positive affect) are milder in magnitude and supported by smaller correlations; critically, Participant 2 shows several strong objective and behavioral protective markers (high circadian amplitude IS Z ≈ 1.54, frequent exercise, low substance use, below-average anxiety/depression) that the summary explicitly weighs as outweighing the modest stress signals, yielding an inference near-to-slightly-below the population mean.  
- Both descriptions explicitly conclude Participant 1 ≈ above-mean PSS and Participant 2 ≈ near/slightly-below-mean PSS in their respective samples. Considering the relative strength, number, and correlations of risk indicators, Participant 1’s profile is more strongly and consistently indicative of elevated perceived stress (relative to that study’s peers) than Participant 2’s profile is.

- Late and variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:05 AM; start-time SD ≈ 93 min) which commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress and daytime dysfunction.
- Reduced positive affect and health satisfaction (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.45), which can modestly increase perceived stress.
- Small positive correlations between early-morning hourly heart-rate deviations (≈0.19–0.21) and PSS that could reflect subtle arousal in some individuals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) — in this dataset GAD-7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), making this a major predictor of elevated perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) and large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD = 232 min, z ≈ 1.12); PSQI is moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ 0.93; r ≈ 0.67) and low general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.62; r ≈ -0.66) — both are strongly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Somatic/functional burden (pain interference PEG-3 ≈ 5.0) that correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.44).
- Elevated resting HR and MESOR (resting HR = 77.6 bpm, z ≈ 1.31; MESOR z ≈ 1.19) consistent with higher baseline autonomic activation.
- Several wearable features (sleep variability, late sleep time) align with stress-related schedule disruption, even though some circadian rhythm metrics show partial resilience.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each summary is explicitly framed relative to its own study population mean PSS. Participant 1’s profile is interpreted as near-to-slightly-below their population mean (21.61) because strong objective circadian regularity and health behaviors (large positive Zs for interdaily stability and amplitude, frequent exercise, low substance use, low anxiety/depression scores) outweigh sleep-quality and reduced positive-affect signals.
- Participant 2’s profile is interpreted as above their population mean (21.08) primarily because several self-report measures that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (GAD-7, PSQI, BASIS-24 emotional lability, NGSE) are notably adverse. The summary explicitly states these self-report predictors are the strongest basis for inferring above-mean PSS, and wearable metrics are described as mixed but not strongly contradictory.
- Weight of evidence: Participant 2 has multiple high-impact, strongly correlated self-report indicators of elevated stress (including a very high-correlation predictor, GAD-7), plus physiological signs of elevated baseline arousal. Participant 1 has some stress-relevant signals (sleep complaints, lower positive affect), but also multiple robust protective indicators (strong circadian rhythmicity, healthy behaviors, low anxiety/depression) that the summary explicitly concludes put them at or slightly below their population mean.

Conclusion
- Overall, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress relative to their respective population mean.

- Elevated anxiety: GAD‑7 = 6; in this dataset GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), making this a highly influential predictor of higher perceived stress.  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.49), which typically accompanies higher stress.  
- Pain-related interference: PEG‑3 average 6.78 and PAPAS composite (z ≈ 0.24); both correlate moderately with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48), supporting added stress burden.  
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability, reduced 24‑h autocorrelation, very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 273 min, z = 1.7) — patterns often linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Social/ interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale above mean (z = 0.54), a contributor to perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower PSS score
- Relatively high self‑efficacy (z ≈ 0.3) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r = −0.65), a substantial protective factor.  
- No substance problems (BASIS‑24 substance z = −1.62).  
- Normative resting HR and long median sleep duration (but the latter is complicated by very high variability and poor subjective quality).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI‑Trait = 46 (z ≈ 0.46) and modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Recurrent daytime physiological arousal: very large aggregated HR peaks in the morning (+30.3 bpm, z ≈ 3.52) and late afternoon (+22.3 bpm, z ≈ 2.0) that could reflect recurring stressors.  
- Lower self‑esteem and lower current happiness (z ≈ −0.73 and −0.53 respectively), which have small-to-modest associations with higher PSS.  
- Slightly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.46), weakly associated with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS score
- Strong restorative sleep: median sleep ~9 h (z ≈ 2.3) and PSQI ≈ 5 (z ≈ −0.8) — objectively and subjectively favorable sleep that typically buffers stress.  
- Robust circadian structure: high amplitude (z ≈ 1.0) and 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ 1.06), generally associated with lower stress.  
- Behavioral/social buffers: frequent exercise (z ≈ 1.07–1.23), substantial social time (z ≈ 1.74), high health satisfaction and good academic functioning.  
- No marked substance-risk signals and good nocturnal HR recovery.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Predictive strength: Participant 1’s strongest stress‑related signals (GAD‑7 and PSQI) are tied to predictors that in this sample have relatively large correlations with PSS (r = 0.78 and r = 0.49). Participant 2’s strongest risk signal (trait anxiety) has a much smaller correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.31), and other risk indicators for P2 have only small associations with PSS.  
- Number and consistency of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple converging stress‑promoting signals (subjective sleep disturbance, anxiety, pain interference, circadian irregularity, interpersonal strain). Participant 2 shows mixed signals but with prominent, robust protective factors (very long, good sleep; strong circadian amplitude; exercise and social support) that likely offset the moderate risk indicators.  
- Relative conclusions in source summaries: P1 summary explicitly infers perceived stress is slightly above their sample mean (21.04). P2 summary infers perceived stress is near their sample mean (21.62) and only possibly modestly above, with substantial protective factors lowering the likelihood of high perceived stress.

Balance of evidence
- The combination of stronger, more highly correlated predictors of stress in Participant 1 (notably anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) and multiple converging risk signals outweighs the protective factors reported for P1.  
- Participant 2’s risk indicators are weaker predictors in their sample and are counterbalanced by several strong protective factors (especially excellent sleep and circadian robustness), making a substantially elevated PSS less likely than for Participant 1.

- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5; “Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).  
- Very short objective sleep (median ~3 h 30 min, very late sleep onset ~03:37 AM) — large, salient abnormality strongly tied to perceived stress.  
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) — both show moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67 at late-night/early-morning) and reduced circadian robustness (amplitude Z ≈ -0.34, reduced 24-h autocorrelation) — physiologic signals that in this sample relate to higher PSS.  
- Convergence of multiple moderate-to-strong stress-related signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) increases likelihood of above-mean perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 46, Z ≈ +0.46) — positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Large, repeated daytime physiological arousal peaks (8–9 AM +30.3 bpm, Z ≈ 3.52; 4–5 PM +22.3 bpm, Z ≈ 2.0) — could reflect recurring stressors or demanding periods.  
- Modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.46) and lower self-esteem / lower happiness (Rosenberg Z ≈ -0.73; happiness Z ≈ -0.53) — small associations with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.21; P2 mean = 21.62). Participant 1 is explicitly judged “above the population mean”; Participant 2 is judged near the population mean (possibly modestly above).  
- Strength and number of risk signals: Participant 1 shows several large, concordant, stress-linked abnormalities (very short objective sleep, clinically disturbed subjective sleep, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations). Those features have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS and are substantial in magnitude. Participant 2’s risk features (trait anxiety, daytime HR spikes) are present but are fewer, generally weaker in sample-level correlation with PSS, and counterbalanced by many strong protective factors.  
- Protective factors: Participant 2 has multiple strong, large-magnitude protective signals (very long restorative sleep Z ≈ +2.3, strong circadian amplitude and autocorrelation Z ≈ +1.0, frequent exercise, high socialization Z ≈ +1.74) that lower the probability of a high PSS. Participant 1 has meaningful protective self-report measures (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability), but these appear less able to offset the pronounced sleep/pain/nocturnal-arousal abnormalities that are more directly and strongly associated with PSS in this sample.  
- Effect-size context: Several of Participant 1’s abnormal features (e.g., objectively extremely short sleep, PSQI well above clinical threshold, pain Z > +1) are large and likely to produce notable increases in perceived stress relative to the cohort. Participant 2 has large-magnitude positive features (long sleep, social/exercise) and only modest-to-moderate risk markers; the net balance points toward a PSS near the cohort mean rather than clearly elevated.

Conclusion
Weighing the within-sample evidence and the relative magnitude/number of stress-linked indicators, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress).

- Strong domain-level correlates of PSS:
  - Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability = 8.33, z = 0.53) with a strong positive correlation to PSS (r = 0.65).
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 12) and PSQI → PSS correlation (r ≈ 0.50).
  - Nocturnal heart-rate elevations across 1–4 AM (hourly HR deviations +10.24, +7.34, +4.18 bpm) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone (resting HR = 78.21 bpm, z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18), consistent with higher physiological arousal linked to stress.
- Marked sleep irregularity and extreme sleep duration (median 12 h, z = 2.26; night-to-night SD = 320 min, z = 2.38) that, although weakly correlated with PSS in this dataset, are behaviorally consistent with stress-related dysregulation.
- Overall summary in the participant’s report explicitly characterizes their inferred PSS as “near the mean” but with evidence supporting modest elevation in specific stress-linked domains.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed), which is associated with higher PSS (modest correlation).
- Elevated intradaily variability (z = 0.67), indicating within-day fragmentation that has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:31 AM), which has small positive associations with stress in this dataset.
- Some behavioral patterns (sedentary leisure, modest alcohol use) that could co-occur with stress-related coping, though correlations to PSS are small here.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS score (within their study frame)
- Low trait internalizing symptoms (CES-D = 7, z = −0.66; STAI–Trait = 34, z = −0.72) and these measures positively correlate with PSS in the sample.
- High self-esteem and health satisfaction (z ≈ 0.96 and 1.05), which are protective (self-esteem r ≈ −0.15 with PSS).
- Favorable physiology: low resting HR (47.8 bpm, z = −1.23) and large circadian amplitude (amplitude z = 1.26), both associated with lower PSS in the cohort.
- Adequate, regular objective sleep (median ≈ 8.5 h, z = 1.61; low sleep-start variability), plus regular social exercise—consistent, multiple protective signals across domains.
- The participant’s integrated judgment in their report is that they are likely at/below the population mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning (explicitly within each study’s population frame)
- Participant 1’s profile includes multiple signals that are relatively strongly associated with PSS in their sample: emotional lability (r ≈ 0.65), PSQI (r ≈ 0.50), and nocturnal HR deviations (r ≈ 0.36–0.41). Those are domain-specific and moderately-to-strongly predictive of higher perceived stress in that cohort. Even though some protective factors exist, the presence of several higher-weight indicators points toward at least modest elevation relative to that study’s mean (or at minimum sits at/near the mean with upward pressure).
- Participant 2’s profile, evaluated against their study mean, contains a mix but overall more and stronger protective indicators (low depression/anxiety, strong circadian amplitude, low resting HR, long regular sleep, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, regular social exercise). The stress-linked signals present for Participant 2 are weaker (PSQI = 6, intradaily variability modest) and the report concludes the participant is likely below the study mean.
- Both descriptions are population-relative. Comparing those within-frame conclusions: Participant 1 is characterized as near the mean with meaningful signs that could elevate stress; Participant 2 is characterized as likely below their mean. The balance of multimodal evidence therefore points to Participant 1 having the worse overall perceived stress relative to their peers than Participant 2 relative to theirs.

20,96613,21,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10), noted as clinically meaningful and strongly correlated with PSS in this cohort (r = 0.77). This is one of the strongest single predictors described.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13.5) with a moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Elevated pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86) with moderate correlations to PSS (~0.45–0.49).
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9) that correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r = 0.66).
- Wearable indicators consistent with disrupted circadian/sleep physiology: very short median sleep (~3 h 55 m), reduced HR rhythm amplitude, low interdaily stability, and flattened/compressed diurnal HR deviations—each modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Although protective factors exist (high general self-efficacy, low interpersonal problems, lower resting HR), the description emphasizes that the strong, highly correlated psychological risk indicators outweigh these buffers and the integrated judgement was that this participant is above the study mean (population mean = 21.04).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), which exceeds the common clinical threshold and is modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated intradaily variability (fragmentation) and late median sleep start (~1:31 AM), both with small positive correlations to PSS.
- Some behavioral patterns (sedentary hobby time, video gaming/TV, weekly beer use) that can co-occur with stress-related coping, though correlations with PSS are small.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or below-mean) PSS score
- Low trait internalizing symptoms (CES-D = 7; STAI-Trait = 34), both below sample mean and moderately correlated with PSS (so their low values are meaningful).
- High self-esteem and health satisfaction (protective).
- Favorable physiological/circadian markers: low resting HR, high cosinor amplitude, long and regular objective sleep duration (8 h 29 m), and moderate interdaily stability—many of which correlate negatively with PSS.
- Regular social exercise and some social engagement, associated with lower stress.
- The integrated judgement in the description is that this participant is likely at or below the sample mean (population mean = 21.61), with the dominant signals pointing toward lower perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Each description is already framed relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as above their sample mean; Participant 2 is characterized as at/below their sample mean.
- More importantly, the strength of the risk indicators differs: Participant 1’s elevated measures include variables that, in that sample, have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.77 and emotional lability r = 0.66). Those strong associations mean the observed elevations are likely to correspond to substantially higher PSS relative to Participant 1’s sample.
- Participant 2’s risk indicators (PSQI, intradaily variability, late timing, behavioral habits) are either modest in magnitude or only weakly correlated with PSS in that cohort. By contrast, Participant 2 shows multiple protective markers with meaningful associations (low CES-D/STAI, high amplitude, long sleep, low resting HR) that consistently point to below-mean PSS.
- Given both the directionality relative to their own samples and the relative strength of predictors, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is experiencing worse overall perceived stress.

- Strong self-report indicators tightly linked to PSS: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16, z ≈ +1.16), high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, z ≈ +0.5), elevated pain interference (PEG‑3 z ≈ +1.18) and emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z ≈ +1.23). Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −1.55) further predicts higher PSS.
- Wearable corroboration of disturbed sleep/circadian rhythm: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m, z ≈ −0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.3), low interdaily stability and very low 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ −1.4), and reduced amplitude (z ≈ −1.4) — all patterns associated in the sample with higher PSS.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal that aligns with PSS: marked nocturnal HR elevations (hourly deviations with positive z’s and positive correlations with PSS, e.g., 1–2am z ≈ +1.18, r ≈ 0.40), supporting subjective distress.
- Convergence and magnitude: multiple domains (affective self‑report + objective nocturnal physiology + disrupted sleep timing) converge in stress‑direction and include several moderately large z’s/correlations, supporting an inference of PSS above that study’s mean (20.92).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their description)
- Some psychosocial signals modestly associated with higher PSS: STAI‑Trait = 41 (near mean), CES‑D = 14 (mild symptoms), lower health satisfaction (z ≈ −1.2) and lower self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ −0.59). These have small-to-moderate positive/negative correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Slightly elevated sleep timing variability (z ≈ +0.35) and behavioral signs (high video‑game time z ≈ +2.47, elevated solitary screen time) that could reflect coping/avoidance patterns associated with stress in some individuals.
- However, these signals are modest in magnitude and the sample correlations are small; they do not strongly push the inference toward PSS well above the sample mean.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is relative to its own study mean (Participant 1: mean = 20.92; Participant 2: mean = 21.61). Participant 1’s profile is explicitly interpreted by the study team as “above the study sample mean,” with multiple strong, convergent indicators (large GAD‑7, elevated pain/emotional lability, extreme short/late sleep, nocturnal HR elevations and disrupted circadian metrics). Participant 2’s profile is explicitly interpreted as “near to slightly below the study sample mean,” with protective and relatively large wearable/circadian signals (high interdaily stability z ≈ +2.07, autocorrelation z ≈ +1.74, amplitude z ≈ +1.01, low resting HR z ≈ −0.97, adequate sleep duration PSQI z ≈ −0.8).
- Magnitude and convergence favor Participant 1: P1 shows multiple stress‑direction deviations across both self‑report and objective physiology with moderate-to-large z’s and positive correlations to PSS. P2’s stress‑direction indicators are smaller and partly contradicted by stronger protective physiological/circadian signals.
- Absolute study means are similar (20.92 vs 21.61). Because P1 is described as above their mean and P2 as at/just below theirs — and because P1’s deviations are larger and more convergent — the balance of evidence points to Participant 1 having the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) even when accounting for the different population baselines.

- Pain/interference scores (PEG‑3 average ≈ 6.78; PAPAS z = 0.24) that correlate with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48) and contribute to stress burden.
- Objective circadian/sleep disruption: low interdaily stability (z = -0.68), low 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -0.35), and very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 273 min, z = 1.7) — patterns commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.54).
- Protective factors exist (self‑efficacy z = 0.3, strong negative correlation with PSS r = -0.65; no substance problems), but the number and strength of the risk indicators (especially GAD‑7 and PSQI) are substantial.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its study’s mean PSS. Participant 1 is inferred to be at or slightly below their sample mean (PSS mean = 21.61). Participant 2 is inferred to be at or modestly above their sample mean (PSS mean = 21.04).
- The predictive weight of indicators differs: Participant 1’s risk signals are mostly modest and/or weakly correlated with PSS (trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem/health are small-to-moderate contributors), while their strong wearable signals (robust circadian regularity, low resting HR, adequate sleep) are protective and supported by sample correlations.
- Participant 2 displays multiple, relatively strong predictors of higher PSS — most notably GAD‑7 (very strong predictor) and severe subjective sleep disturbance — plus objective circadian/sleep irregularity. Although Participant 2 also has meaningful protective factors (self‑efficacy, no substance problems), the key high-weight risk signals are more numerous and stronger than Participant 1’s risk signals.

Overall balance and determination
- Considering that Participant 1 is characterized as near/slightly below their population mean and has several strong physiological/regularity protections, while Participant 2 is characterized as at/modestly above their population mean with multiple strong self‑report and objective risk indicators (particularly GAD‑7 and PSQI), Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ +1.52) and objectively late, shortened sleep (median 6 h 1 min; sleep onset ~03:56 AM; sleep-start variability ≈ 74 min). Poor/short/late sleep in this sample is associated with higher PSS.
- Blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63) and some intradaily fragmentation, plus late‑night heart‑rate elevations—physiological signals that align with higher stress.
- Behavioral inactivity (no regular exercise), a common co-occurring risk factor.

Protective/mitigating factors noted in the description: no substance use, strong GPA, some social/leisure engagement, above‑average interdaily stability. The study interpretation explicitly characterizes Participant 1 as above the mean but “modestly elevated” rather than extreme.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Very large objective and subjective sleep abnormalities: PSQI = 11.5 and median nightly sleep ~3 h 30 min with late sleep onset (~03:37 AM). These are large deviations and PSQI and sleep duration show moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS in the sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.48).
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) and pain measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations during typical sleep hours (hourly Z up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian robustness—physiological patterns linked with greater perceived stress.
- The study summary frames these convergent risks (sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) as substantial drivers of an “above mean” PSS inference.

Protective/mitigating factors: low self‑reported anxiety (GAD‑7 Z ≈ -0.85) — importantly, GAD‑7 has a large sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so this is a strong indicator of lower PSS; high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97) are additional substantial buffers.

Comparative within‑sample reasoning
- Severity of sleep disturbance: Participant 2’s objective sleep restriction (≈3.5 h) is far more extreme than Participant 1’s modest short sleep (~6.0 h). In both descriptions, sleep measures are among the strongest correlates with PSS; the magnitude of Participant 2’s sleep deficit is therefore a larger risk signal.
- Additional somatic load: Participant 2 shows elevated pain/interference with moderate correlation to PSS; Participant 1’s somatic signals are weaker (no elevated pain reported).
- Affective symptoms: Participant 1 has elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both positively associated with PSS), whereas Participant 2 has low general anxiety and high self‑efficacy (strongly protective, and GAD‑7 has a particularly strong correlation with PSS in this sample). Thus affective-protection favors Participant 2 (i.e., reduces their inferred stress) and affective-risk favors Participant 1.
- Physiological arousal: Both participants show nocturnal HR elevations and reduced circadian amplitude, but Participant 2’s nocturnal HR deviations and extremely short sleep appear larger in magnitude and temporally coincident.
- Net balance: Participant 1 shows several moderate psychosocial/affective risk signals but with notable protective factors and overall is described as “modestly elevated.” Participant 2 shows a cluster of large, concordant physiological/behavioral risk signals (very short sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) that the summary treats as strong drivers of an above‑mean inference, though this is partially offset by strong self‑report protections (low anxiety, high self‑efficacy).

Overall judgment
While Participant 1 has elevated depression/anxiety and disturbed sleep that point toward above‑mean perceived stress, Participant 2’s extremely restricted objective sleep (≈3.5 h), elevated pain, and pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal are more severe, high‑impact signals that—despite substantial protective self‑report factors—more strongly argue for a higher PSS relative to that participant’s cohort. In short, Participant 2’s risk signals are larger in magnitude and more physiologically salient than Participant 1’s, so Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

Given the strong correlations of NGSE (r ≈ -0.60) and GAD (r ≈ +0.75) with PSS in this dataset, these are powerful indicators that Participant 1 is below their population mean. The only meaningful risk signal for P1 is subjective sleep disturbance, and the cardiac correlations are small-to-moderate.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple, converging moderate-to-strong risk signals (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, high PSQI, short/late/variable sleep, reduced amplitude, nocturnal HR elevation, inactivity). Several of these have non-trivial correlations with PSS and their z‑scores are meaningfully above average (particularly PSQI and CES‑D). Although Participant 2 has some protective factors (no substance use, good GPA, some interdaily stability), the number and consistency of stress‑related indicators outweigh the protections.  
- In sum, Participant 1’s profile is characterized mainly by strong protective/low‑stress signals with one isolated sleep-related complaint, whereas Participant 2’s profile contains multiple concordant risk signals associated with higher PSS.

- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI z ≈ +0.46; CES‑D z ≈ +0.28), both positively associated with PSS in the sample.  
- Low self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ −1.57), which is linked to greater perceived stress vulnerability.  
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, above clinical cut point) despite objectively long sleep. Subjective poor sleep is correlated with higher PSS.  
- Very low reported exercise (exercise z ≈ −1.9), a behavioral correlate of higher stress.  
- Elevated cardiac activation (MESOR z ≈ +1.77; resting HR z ≈ +1.55), which in this sample correlates with higher PSS.  
- Lifestyle markers associated with higher stress in the sample (high internet use z ≈ +1.52; sedentary hobby z ≈ +1.41).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study sample):
- Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) and the sample‑level very strong correlation between GAD‑7 and PSS (r = 0.77) — this is the single strongest self‑report predictor cited.  
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) with substantial correlation to PSS (r = 0.49).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z ≈ +0.93; r ≈ 0.67) and lower self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.62; r ≈ −0.66), both strong correlates of higher PSS in this sample.  
- Some somatic burden (pain interference PEG‑3 ≈ 5.0; r ≈ 0.44) that tends to raise stress appraisal.  
- Physiological signals consistent with higher arousal: elevated resting HR and MESOR (resting HR z ≈ +1.31; MESOR z ≈ +1.19) and large night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.12).  
- Late sleep timing and subjective sleep disturbance that typically co‑occur with higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning:
- Both participants are inferred as being above (or near-above) their sample means, but the nature and strength of the predictors differ. Participant 1’s above‑mean signals are mixed and often modest (small-to-moderate elevations in trait anxiety/depression, elevated resting HR) and are balanced by several strong protective indicators in the wearable data (robust circadian stability, long consistent objective sleep, low intradaily variability, social/academic engagement). The summary explicitly characterizes Participant 1 as “near to slightly above” their population mean.  
- Participant 2’s profile is driven by multiple self‑report indicators that the summary states are among the strongest correlates of PSS in that dataset (notably GAD‑7, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy, very poor PSQI). The summary emphasizes these as the primary basis for concluding the participant is above the sample mean, with wearable metrics providing secondary, mixed support. Participant 2’s self‑report predictors have larger sample correlations with PSS than the main indicators for Participant 1.  
- Because the inference for Participant 1 is cautiously “near/slightly above” mean (with strong physiological/circadian protective features), while the inference for Participant 2 is more clearly “above the mean” driven by several high‑correlation self‑report measures, the balance of evidence points to Participant 2 having the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective sample.

- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81, Z ≈ +0.93). PAPAS also correlates with PSS at r ≈ 0.53.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62), and NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.69).
- Elevated nocturnal heart‑rate deviations and higher mesor/resting HR (Zs ≈ +0.6 to +1.38), physiological markers that are positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47 for night HR; mesor/RHR also positive).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83), consistent with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Several independent signals (subjective symptoms, pain, self‑efficacy, and physiology) converge in the direction of higher PSS.

Mitigating factors for Participant 1: relatively low GAD‑7 (Z ≈ −0.76), long median nightly sleep duration (Z ≈ +0.92), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ −1.28), and slightly lower emotional lability (Z ≈ −0.37) — these temper but do not erase the multiple stress‑related signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI trait Z ≈ +0.46; CES‑D Z ≈ +0.28).
- Very low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.57), which can relate to greater perceived stress.

- Very low exercise frequency (Z ≈ −1.9), and lifestyle markers of sedentary/leisure internet use (internet Z ≈ +1.52; sedentary hobby Z ≈ +1.41) that associate with higher PSS.
- Elevated cardiovascular activation (MESOR Z ≈ +1.77; RHR Z ≈ +1.55), physiological arousal positively associated with PSS.

Mitigating factors for Participant 2: very strong circadian/behavioral regulation (interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.33; 24‑h autocorr Z ≈ +1.23; low IV Z ≈ −0.81), long and consistent nightly sleep (median sleep Z ≈ +1.26; low sleep start SD Z ≈ −0.96), reasonable social time and strong academics, and heart‑rate amplitude (Z ≈ +0.83) that in this sample associates with lower PSS. The synthesis for this participant explicitly characterizes them as “near to slightly above” the population mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as at or above their respective population means, but the characterizations differ in strength: Participant 1 is characterized as “likely above” the mean (moderately elevated), while Participant 2 is characterized as “near to slightly above” the mean (closer to the mean).
- Participant 1 shows multiple moderately strong, converging risk signals that are directly tied to PSS in this sample (notably very poor subjective sleep, high pain/PAPAS, and lower self‑efficacy — with correlations up to |r| ≈ 0.53–0.69). Several physiological markers (nocturnal HR elevations, higher mesor/RHR) further align with higher PSS.
- Participant 2 shows important risk signals (trait anxiety/depression, very low self‑esteem, high resting HR/MESOR, low exercise), but these are counterbalanced by robust protective circadian and objective sleep measures (high interdaily stability, long consistent sleep, low IV) that the summary explicitly states mitigate the stress signal and lead to an inference of “near to modestly above” the mean.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s key psychosocial correlates of PSS (pain, subjective sleep, and self‑efficacy) are both sizable in z‑score and linked to strong sample correlations with PSS (especially NGSE). Participant 2’s strongest z‑scores include physiological activation and very low exercise/self‑esteem, but several of these are offset by strong protective circadian regulation and objectively good sleep — the narrative and z‑profile emphasize mitigation.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Given the number and strength of convergent indicators tied to PSS in Participant 1 (subjective sleep very poor, high pain, low self‑efficacy, nocturnal HR elevation) and the explicit synthesis that they are “likely above” the study mean, versus Participant 2’s profile which is described as “near to slightly above” the mean because strong circadian/sleep protections offset psychosocial/physiologic risk signals, the balance favors Participant 1 as having the worse overall perceived stress.

- Elevated resting heart rate and high HR mesor (resting HR z ≈ +0.77; mesor z ≈ +1.81). These metrics have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ +0.14) and could indicate higher tonic arousal.
- Low physical activity / sedentary lifestyle (exercise reported 1–2×/month; negative exercise z-scores), which may modestly increase stress vulnerability.
- Greater-than-average alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week; z ≈ +1.0), a small risk correlate for higher PSS.
- Subjective happiness below sample mean (z ≈ −0.53), which has a small negative correlation with PSS and could reflect some elevated perceived stress.
Note: these signals are modest in effect size and the description explicitly concludes the participant is likely below the population mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10), which in this sample correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ +0.77). This is a major driver toward above-mean PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; correlation with PSS ≈ +0.49) and extremely short median recorded sleep (≈3 h 55 m), both strongly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86) with moderate correlations to PSS (~0.45–0.49).
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9) with a strong positive correlation to PSS (r ≈ +0.66).
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude z ≈ −1.51; interdaily stability z ≈ −0.75), which modestly associate with higher PSS.
Protective factors (high general self-efficacy, low interpersonal problems, low resting HR) are present but the strongest predictors here point toward higher-than-mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning (taking within-sample frames into account)
- Participant 1’s risk signals are relatively weak and/or have small correlations with PSS in their cohort (HR, alcohol, low activity). Their strongest indicators (no depressive symptoms, below-average trait anxiety, long/regular sleep, good circadian amplitude) point clearly to below-mean perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, strong, and highly correlated predictors of elevated PSS in their cohort (notably GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, pain measures). Several of these predictors have large effect sizes/correlations with PSS in that study, and objective sleep and circadian metrics are also substantially abnormal (very short sleep, blunted amplitude).
- Even accounting for each description being relative to different population means, the magnitudes and number of strong positive predictors for Participant 2 outweigh the modest, smaller-effect upward cues for Participant 1.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (above their study mean PSS), while Participant 1 is most consistent with below-mean perceived stress.

23,22913,17,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Elevated resting heart rate and a high hourly HR mesor (resting HR z ≈ +0.77; mesor z ≈ +1.81) — these have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ +0.14), so they weakly point toward higher perceived stress.
- Low physical activity / sedentary lifestyle (exercise 1–2×/month; negative z-scores) — could increase stress vulnerability, though association with PSS in this sample is modest.
- Greater-than-average alcohol use (beer/wine ~1–2×/week; z ≈ +1.0) — a small upward cue for stress.
- Below-average current happiness (z ≈ -0.53) — weakly associated with higher PSS.
Overall: these risk signals exist but are modest in magnitude and have weak correlations with PSS in this sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), which correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r = 0.48).
- Extremely short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) and large sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), both of which are behaviorally and physiologically linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Substantial nocturnal heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (12–1 AM = +11.96 bpm; 1–2 AM = +14.62 bpm; z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation showing a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.46).
Overall: these sleep- and nocturnal-arousal indicators are relatively large effects and moderately correlated with PSS, providing notable evidence toward higher perceived stress within this participant’s sample.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning:
- Both descriptions are written relative to their own sample means and conclude the participant is likely below that mean; however, the strength and consistency of evidence differ.
- Participant 1’s profile shows several consistent, concordant protective signals (CES-D = 0; long objective sleep duration z = +1.79; very low intradaily variability z = -1.8; decent circadian amplitude z = +0.84; below-average trait anxiety), many of which are large z-score departures and together strongly favor below-mean PSS. The upward cues for P1 (elevated HR/mesor, low activity, alcohol) are smaller in magnitude and have weak correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Participant 2’s profile is mixed: very strong protective trait signals (very low GAD-7, which in this sample is strongly correlated with PSS, and relatively high self-efficacy) argue for lower perceived stress, but the sleep-related risk signals are large in magnitude (very short sleep, high PSQI, pronounced nocturnal HR arousal) and have moderate correlations with PSS. Thus P2 has both a few very predictive protective markers and several fairly strong risk markers concentrated on sleep/nocturnal arousal.
- When weighing effect sizes and correlations: P2’s sleep/nocturnal indicators are moderate-to-strong predictors of higher PSS (r ≈ 0.46–0.48) and are extreme in absolute terms (very short sleep, big nocturnal HR deviations). P1’s risk markers are weaker both in magnitude and in correlation with PSS. P1’s overall profile is more uniformly indicative of low perceived stress than P2’s profile, which is split between strong daytime/trait protection and substantial nighttime/sleep risk.

Conclusion (which participant likely has the higher PSS):
- Taking the balance of evidence within each study frame, Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their sample) than Participant 1. Participant 1’s signals are more consistently protective and stronger in aggregate, whereas Participant 2’s pronounced sleep deprivation and nocturnal arousal — moderately correlated with PSS — make them the more likely to have higher perceived stress overall.

- Very delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:12) and high night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 146 min, z ≈ 1.04), both linked to worse stress regulation in the literature and in this sample.
- High daytime napping (z ≈ 2.66) and very high internet use (z ≈ 2.19), behaviors that can reflect or exacerbate stress-related dysregulation.
- Low exercise frequency (z ≈ -1.09 to -1.18), removing a common protective behavior.
- Low reported trust of others (z ≈ -2.07) and modestly lower happiness (z ≈ -0.53), social/affective signals that can increase perceived stress.
- Some wearable circadian markers indicate moderate instability (e.g., autocorrelation 24 h z ≈ -0.36), which modestly relates to higher PSS in the sample.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower PSS score (protective indicators)
- Trait mood/anxiety scores below sample mean (CES-D = 10, STAI-Trait = 31; z-scores negative), robustly associated with lower perceived stress.
- Relatively high self-esteem (z ≈ 0.96).
- Low resting heart rate and pronounced day–night heart-rate amplitude (circadian amplitude z ≈ 0.63), which correlated negatively with PSS in the sample.
- Long median nightly sleep duration (~8 h 29 min, z ≈ 1.61) and good academic performance (GPA ~3.74–3.77).
- Low alcohol / non-prescribed drug use.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study population frame)
- Elevated clinical symptoms strongly tied to PSS: GAD-7 = 10.5 (at clinical screening threshold) with very high correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale Z = 0.53; correlation with PSS ≈ 0.65).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8.5), above clinical cutoff and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z ≈ 1.21), which correlate positively with PSS.
- Nocturnal/evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., +13.9 bpm at 12–1am, Z ≈ 1.36) that correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), indicating physiological arousal during night hours.
- Substantial night-to-night sleep variability (SD ≈ 199 min, Z ≈ 0.65), which can exacerbate subjective stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS score (protective indicators)
- New General Self-Efficacy slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.12), and this scale correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.65).
- Good circadian regularity/strength (interdaily stability and autocorrelation z-scores positive), which correlate negatively with PSS and suggest behavioral buffering.
- Low resting heart rate (55.7 bpm, Z ≈ -0.86) and low substance-abuse scores (BASIS-24 substance Z ≈ -0.77), indicating physiological resilience and low substance-related risk.

Comparative reasoning within the population-relative frames
- The narrative for Participant 1 explicitly concludes “near the study population mean” (Population mean PSS = 21.61). The risk indicators for P1 are mainly behavioral/chronobiological (late/irregular sleep, high internet use, low exercise, low trust), while several relatively strong trait/physiological protections (low CES-D/STAI, high self-esteem, low RHR, strong circadian amplitude, long average sleep duration, high GPA) are present. The summary weights these protections enough to infer near-mean rather than above-mean PSS.
- The narrative for Participant 2 explicitly concludes “above the study population mean” (Population mean PSS = 20.92). Crucially, Participant 2 shows multiple survey-based signals that are tightly correlated with PSS in that study (GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.65; PSQI r ≈ 0.55) plus corroborating nocturnal HR elevations that also correlate with PSS. Although Participant 2 has protective circadian regularity and low RHR, the presence of clinical-level anxiety, elevated sleep disturbance, pain interference, and nocturnal physiological arousal are strong, convergent predictors of above-mean perceived stress.
- Relative strength of evidence favors Participant 2 as having higher perceived stress: P2’s strongest predictors are clinically meaningful symptom scores with high correlations to PSS and objective nocturnal arousal that aligns with subjective reports. P1’s strongest predictors are protective trait measures and physiological resilience, and the risks are more behavioral/chronotype-related and were judged to place P1 near rather than above the sample mean.

Conclusion
Based on the within-population summaries and the relative weight of converging predictors, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress).

- High internet use (z ≈ +2.19) and low exercise (z ≈ -1.1), behaviors that can reflect or worsen stress-related dysregulation.
- Low trust in others (z ≈ -2.07) and somewhat lower happiness (z ≈ -0.53), potential social/affective contributors to stress.
- Some circadian instability indicators (autocorrelation at 24 h z ≈ -0.36) and measures (intradaily variability, sleep-start variability) that correlate modestly with PSS.
- However, many of these risk indicators are offset in magnitude or strength by protective factors in this sample (see below), so the evidence for above-mean PSS is weaker and more mixed than for Participant 1.

Comparative weighing (within-sample framing)
- Participant 1: multiple strong, independent indicators that are both large in magnitude and are measures with high correlations to PSS in the cohort (especially anxiety r = 0.77 and emotional lability r = 0.66). Objective physiology and extremely short/late sleep support a coherent picture of elevated perceived stress relative to their sample mean (21.08).
- Participant 2: shows a mixed profile with several behavioral/subjective risk markers (late/variable sleep, high internet use, napping, low exercise), but also clear protective and strongly weighted indicators (low trait depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, long median sleep duration, low resting HR, pronounced heart-rate amplitude, strong academic performance). The study summary explicitly judged this participant as near the sample mean (21.61).
- Overall, the evidence for above-mean PSS is stronger, more convergent, and based on higher-correlation predictors for Participant 1 than for Participant 2, whose risk signs are counterbalanced by robust protective signs.

- Slightly elevated resting heart rate (61.2 bpm; z ≈ 0.36), which has a small positive correlation with PSS.
- Low social/recreational engagement (socializing z ≈ −1.41; many “do not do” leisure activities), reducing social buffering against stress.

- Protective factors (high general self-efficacy, low interpersonal problems, low resting HR) exist but are unlikely to fully offset the multiple strong risk signals above.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s risk indicators are present but predominantly modest in effect size: subjective sleep complaints, slight trait anxiety, some social isolation and slightly elevated resting HR. These are counterbalanced by several relatively strong protective signals (very high interdaily stability z = 1.00 and 24-h autocorrelation z = 2.49, low depressive symptoms, above-average happiness, low substance use). The net inference provided in the description is near the population mean PSS with a modest lean toward below-mean stress.
- Participant 2 exhibits multiple, strongly predictive self-report elevations (clinically meaningful anxiety, very poor PSQI, high pain, emotional lability) that in this cohort have moderate-to-large correlations with PSS. Wearable signals (very short sleep, blunted amplitude, irregular rhythms) further align with elevated stress. Although Participant 2 has meaningful protective factors (high self-efficacy with a strong negative correlation to PSS), the number and strength of risk indicators—especially those with high correlations to PSS—make an above-mean PSS the most consistent inference for this participant.
- Both participants’ population means are similar (21.61 vs. 21.04), so comparison is primarily about the strength and number of within-cohort predictors. Participant 2 shows more numerous and stronger predictors of higher perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.

- Elevated intradaily variability (IV z = 0.74), indicating more fragmented activity/HR patterns; IV has a small positive correlation with PSS.

- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53, and this measure has a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal: large hourly HR elevations at 1–4 AM (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (resting HR = 78.21 bpm, z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18), indicating higher baseline cardiovascular tone associated with higher PSS in this context.
- Markedly atypical and unstable sleep quantity (median ~12 h, z = 2.26; sleep duration SD z = 2.38), which may reflect dysregulation often accompanying stress (even though correlations with PSS are weak in this dataset).

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning:
- Participant 1’s strongest signals point toward lower perceived stress relative to their sample: notably low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI–Trait z = -1.51; CES-D z = -0.97) and high subjective well-being (happiness z = 1.64; health satisfaction z = 1.3). These variables have relatively strong positive/negative associations with PSS in the dataset and therefore are powerful protective indicators. The elevated-risk signals for Participant 1 (PSQI >5, IV, late sleep timing, small nocturnal HR deviations) are present but modest in size and have only small correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2 displays multiple moderate-to-strong signals that are directly and substantially associated with higher PSS in this dataset: very high PSQI (raw score 12; r ≈ 0.50 with PSS), elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24; r ≈ 0.65), and clearly elevated nocturnal and baseline HR metrics (moderate correlations with PSS). Although Participant 2 also has protective factors (low pain, good interpersonal functioning, mild anxiety), the convergence of several relatively strong PSS-related indicators (especially emotional lability + severe subjective sleep disturbance + nocturnal HR arousal) provides stronger evidence for elevated perceived stress relative to their population mean than the modest risk signals seen for Participant 1 relative to theirs.

Overall judgment:
- Weighing magnitude and predictive relevance of signals within each participant’s population frame, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit higher overall perceived stress (i.e., a PSS score above their sample mean or closer to an elevated position) than Participant 1, whose profile is overall more consistent with below-mean perceived stress.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (strongly disturbed) and PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- High emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 0.63), which correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.66).  
- Pain/interference indicators that positively correlate with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).  
- Objective physiological signs of activation: elevated resting HR (76.35 bpm, Z = 1.19) and elevated MESOR (Z = 1.24).  
- Circadian dysregulation: reduced diurnal amplitude (Z = -1.05), low interdaily stability (Z = -0.46), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.07) — pattern consistent with blunted day–night rhythm and fragmentation linked to higher PSS.  
- Pronounced early‑morning HR elevations (1:00–8:00 AM; several hours with Z > 1) that correlate moderately with PSS.  
- Extremely short median nightly sleep (median 1 h 39 m, Z = -1.27) and very late median sleep start (~04:36 AM); presence of naps and consolidated very short sleep episodes — together suggesting nocturnal hyperarousal and insufficient sleep associated with higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Each profile must be interpreted relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1’s strongest signals (low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high happiness and health satisfaction, low resting HR and near-average circadian metrics) are well-aligned with lower-than-average PSS in that sample. The upward signals for Participant 1 (PSQI >5, late timing, elevated IV, small early‑morning HR deviations) are modest in magnitude and come from measures that show only small correlations with PSS in the dataset. Overall, the summary explicitly concluded Participant 1 is likely below the population mean.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple, convergent indicators that are both substantially deviant from the population and tied to measures with strong correlations to PSS (notably anxiety, emotional lability, PSQI, and self‑efficacy). Objective physiological and circadian metrics also show coherent patterns (elevated resting HR/MESOR, low amplitude, high IV, nocturnal HR elevation) that align with elevated perceived stress. The summary explicitly concludes Participant 2 is likely above their study mean. While some mitigating signals exist (GAD‑7 only mild, possible wearable artifacts for sleep duration), the number, magnitude, and high PSS‑correlation of key measures for Participant 2 outweigh those caveats.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 has many independent lines of strong evidence (self-report scales with high PSS correlations and corroborating physiological/circadian disruptions) indicating higher perceived stress relative to their population mean.  
- Participant 1 shows a few modest risk markers but stronger, higher‑weight signals pointing to lower-than-average perceived stress in their population.  
- Even allowing for potential wearable artifacts in Participant 2’s extreme sleep metric, the convergence of multiple highly correlated self-report indicators plus physiological dysregulation supports a clear inference that Participant 2’s perceived stress is higher (relative to their peers) than Participant 1’s perceived stress is relative to theirs.

6,43382,20,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report risk factors that are tightly linked to PSS in this sample:
  - GAD‑7 = 10 (moderate anxiety) — this scale has the largest sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so anxiety symptoms strongly predict higher perceived stress.
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z = 0.93; r ≈ 0.67) and low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = −0.62; r ≈ −0.66) — both are strongly associated with higher PSS in this cohort.
  - Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5; r ≈ 0.49) and some pain interference (PEG‑3; r ≈ 0.44) — additional contributors to higher stress appraisal.
- Wearable/physiological indicators that are congruent with higher arousal:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (RHR z = 1.31; MESOR z = 1.19).
  - High night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.12) and relatively late sleep onset.
- Overall: multiple high‑correlation self‑report measures and several physiological indices point coherently toward above‑mean perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Psychological symptoms and sleep deficits that favor higher stress:
  - CES‑D = 28 (Z ≈ 1.53) and STAI‑Trait = 46 (Z ≈ 0.46). These have positive, but modest, correlations with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32).
  - Short median sleep (6 h 10 min; z ≈ −1.27) and very late sleep onset — sleep quantity/timing likely promote higher perceived stress.
  - Modestly elevated resting cardiovascular tone (RHR/MESOR z ≈ 0.6–1.3), which aligns weakly with higher PSS.
- However, several protective/offsetting factors weaken the net signal for very high PSS:
  - High self‑reported happiness (z ≈ 1.64) and health satisfaction (z ≈ 1.22).
  - Robust circadian regularity (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high 24‑h autocorrelation) and low substance use — these metrics correlate with lower PSS in the cohort and counterbalance symptom elevations.
- Overall: evidence supports a moderate elevation above the sample mean, but the key predictors have smaller correlations with PSS and are partially offset by resilience indicators.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Both descriptions conclude each participant is likely above their respective population mean PSS. The critical comparative point is the strength and number of predictors and their sample‑level correlations with PSS:
  - Participant 1 shows multiple high‑impact predictors that, in this dataset, have strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77, BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.67, NGSE r ≈ −0.66, PSQI r ≈ 0.49). These give substantial, convergent weight toward higher perceived stress.
  - Participant 2 has some elevated symptoms (notably CES‑D) and short sleep, but the measures that drive stress in this cohort have smaller correlations (CES‑D/STAI r ≈ 0.29–0.32). Participant 2 also has several clear protective signals (high happiness/health satisfaction, strong circadian regularity) that blunt the net elevation.
- Given that Participant 1’s top contributors are both numerous and more strongly correlated with PSS in their sample, the balance of evidence indicates a larger deviation toward higher perceived stress for Participant 1 than for Participant 2 (whose elevation appears more moderate and offset).

5,43382,14,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very severe and objectively-confirmed sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”) and median wearable sleep ≈ 3 hr/night with very large sleep-timing variability (sleep-start SD Z = 2.82). Sleep measures here have substantial positive correlations with PSS in the sample and are extreme in magnitude, making them high-weight indicators of elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 with a very strong reported correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 emotional lability Z = 0.43 (r ≈ 0.68). These highly PSS-correlated symptom measures point toward higher stress.
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS; these add further risk for higher perceived stress.
- Circadian instability / dampened rhythms: Low interdaily stability and low amplitude (Zs −1.42, −1.10) are associated here with higher PSS and support a stress-related dysregulation interpretation.
- Multiple high-weight indicators align in the same direction (sleep, anxiety, emotional lability, substance issues), so the cumulative signal is strong for above-mean PSS.

Mitigating factors to note (reduce but do not eliminate the above signal)
- Very high self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79), which has a strong negative correlation with PSS in this sample and is a robust protective factor.
- Lower resting HR / lower mesor (Z ≈ −0.55, −0.66), mildly inconsistent with high tonic stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 28 (Z ≈ 1.53) and STAI–Trait = 46 (Z ≈ 0.46). These scales correlate positively with PSS and are primary drivers for inferring above-mean stress here.
- Short and late sleep: Median sleep ≈ 6 hr 10 min (Z ≈ −1.27) and late median sleep onset (~01:28), which can impair recovery and modestly relate to higher PSS.
- Slightly elevated cardiovascular baseline: Resting HR and MESOR above mean (Zs ≈ 0.6–1.3) with small positive correlations with PSS.

Protective/offsetting factors (substantially reduce inferred stress)
- Strong circadian regularity and low intraday fragmentation (interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.33; intradaily variability Z ≈ −0.74; autocorrelation Z ≈ 0.73), which, in this sample, trend with lower PSS.
- Low substance use, very low napping (0.07/day), orderly heart-rate/daytime patterns — behavioral indicators consistent with lower stress.
- High self-rated happiness and health satisfaction (Zs ≈ 1.64 and 1.22) and higher self-reported well-being, which correlate negatively with PSS and offset symptom-based risk.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and number of high-weight indicators: Participant 1 has multiple, strongly PSS-correlated indicators pointing toward elevated stress (extremely short/objective sleep, high PSQI, GAD-7 with very high correlation to PSS, emotional lability, substance problems). Participant 2’s strongest indicators are elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D) and some late/short sleep, but those measures have smaller correlations with PSS in that sample and are counterbalanced by many protective, well-correlated rhythm and well-being metrics.
- Magnitude/extremity of signals: Participant 1’s objectively extreme sleep deprivation (~3 hours/night) and very high sleep-timing variability are far more extreme than Participant 2’s moderately short sleep (~6.1 hours) and modest variability—this favors a larger above-mean deviation for Participant 1.
- Correlation weights: Key predictors in Participant 1’s profile (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability) have larger reported correlations with PSS in that dataset than do Participant 2’s primary risk indicators (CES-D, STAI), so similar nominal z-scores translate into a larger inferred effect on PSS for Participant 1.
- Protective factors: Participant 2 shows multiple protective signals (robust circadian regularity, high happiness/health satisfaction, low substance use) that actively reduce the inferred PSS elevation; Participant 1 has one very strong protective factor (NGSE) but fewer protective behavioral/circadian signals.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits a higher level of perceived stress (a larger elevation above their study mean) than Participant 2. Participant 1’s multiple, strongly PSS-linked and partly objective indicators (especially extreme sleep disruption and highly PSS-correlated anxiety/lability) outweigh their protective self-efficacy and low resting HR. Participant 2 appears moderately above their population mean but is more clearly offset by several robust protective signals, yielding a smaller net elevation.

6,30453,20,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean):
- Strong, convergent self-report risk signals: high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 31, Z = 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI ≈ Z 0.96), both positively correlated with PSS in that dataset.
- Extremely poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = 4.29), a very large deviation and a robust correlate of higher PSS.
- Physiological signs of dysregulation: elevated resting HR (RHR Z = 1.11) and MESOR (Z = 0.85), reduced circadian amplitude (Z = −0.63), low interdaily stability (Z = −0.9), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.6) — a pattern commonly associated with chronic stress and mood disturbance.
- Shorter and late/variable sleep timing (median ~01:21; sleep SD Z = 1.0; duration Z = −0.96), which align with increased perceived stress.
- Psychosocial strain: lower self-esteem, lower happiness and lower health satisfaction.
- Protective behaviors are present (regular exercise, low substance use, leisure coping), but the magnitude and convergence of the above risk indicators (especially the extreme PSQI and elevated depressive symptoms) point toward greater perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean):
- Relevant self-report risk factors: moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10), elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ 0.93), lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.62), and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5); these measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Some physiological/behavioral indicators consistent with stress: high resting HR and MESOR (RHR z = 1.31; MESOR z = 1.19) and large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.12).
- Somatic burden: pain interference (PEG-3 average 5.0) which correlates with higher PSS.
- Important mitigators/resilience signals: median sleep duration is reasonable (≈7 h, z = 0.56), intradaily variability is low (z = −1.20 indicating less fragmentation), modestly positive circadian amplitude (z = 0.43) and some regularity (autocorrelation z = 0.25). Wearable signals are mixed and many have weak/ambiguous correlations with PSS in this dataset.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame):
- Participant 1’s risk profile is more consistent and more extreme on key predictors of PSS: notably a very large PSQI Z (4.29) and a high CES-D Z (1.84), plus multiple convergent wearable markers of circadian/physiological dysregulation. Those strong, concordant signals point to perceived stress substantially above their population mean.
- Participant 2 shows several meaningful self-report vulnerabilities (anxiety, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) and elevated RHR/MESOR, but the self-report anxiety severity (GAD-7) is only moderate (and a small z-score), and wearable/circadian features are mixed with several protective indicators (reasonable sleep duration, low intradaily variability, modestly preserved amplitude). Overall the evidence for markedly elevated PSS is less uniform and less extreme than for Participant 1.
- Both participants are inferred as “above mean” in their respective reports, but the magnitude and convergence of risk markers are greater and more consistent for Participant 1.

- Elevated anxiety: GAD‑7 = 6 (mild) and GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.78). This is a major contributor to higher perceived stress.

- Pain-related interference: PEG‑3 average 6.78 and PAPAS composite (z ≈ 0.24) both positively correlated with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Circadian/behavioral irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = -0.68), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -0.35), very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 273 min, z = 1.7) — objective signatures associated with higher PSS.
- Some interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale z = +0.54 (more strain).
Countervailing (protective) features noted in the description (self‑efficacy, no substance problems, normative resting HR, long median sleep duration) reduce but do not fully offset the above signals; the original summary judged the participant “slightly above” their study mean (21.04).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Objective circadian fragmentation: high intradaily variability (z = +1.51), low interdaily stability (z = -0.74), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -1.12), and reduced amplitude (z = -0.57). These rhythm disruptions have modest positive correlations with PSS in the cohort.
- Mild subjective sleep complaint: PSQI = 6 (classified as disturbed sleep), which is positively associated with PSS.
- Slightly elevated resting HR (z ≈ +0.20) with a small positive correlation with PSS.
However, the profile also includes multiple strong protective factors (low depressive symptoms, high happiness and self‑esteem, regular and adequate sleep duration/timing, frequent exercise, low substance use), and the original summary judged the participant “near the mean or modestly below” their study mean (21.62).

Comparative, within‑population framing and overall weighing
- Each description is relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is inferred to be slightly above their population mean (21.04). Participant 2 is inferred to be near or modestly below their population mean (21.62).
- The strength of predictors differs: Participant 1 shows several moderately-to-strong predictors of elevated PSS (notably the GAD‑7 association r = 0.78 and very high subjective sleep disturbance PSQI = 13), plus pain interference and clear circadian irregularity. These predictors are both numerous and include one with a very large sample correlation to PSS.
- Participant 2’s indicators that would raise PSS are mainly objective rhythm fragmentation and a borderline PSQI; these associations in the cohort are modest. Meanwhile, Participant 2 has multiple and relatively strong protective psychosocial and behavioral signals (low depression, high happiness, regular sleep, exercise, low substance use).
- Given the relative weights reported (very strong anxiety–PSS link for Participant 1, higher subjective sleep disturbance and pain interference for Participant 1, versus only modest wearable‑based rhythm signals for Participant 2 and many protective self‑reports), the balance of evidence supports Participant 1 having the higher perceived stress.

- Several of these indicators (especially anxiety, subjective sleep, self‑efficacy) are noted in the summary as high‑weight predictors of above‑mean PSS in that population.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their writeup)
- Objective circadian fragmentation: high intradaily variability (Z = +1.51), reduced interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation (Z negative), and reduced amplitude — these metrics are modestly positively associated with PSS in that sample (r values ~0.16–0.17).  
- Slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z ≈ +0.20).  
- PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), a subjective sleep complaint linked to higher PSS.  
- Note: the writeup frames these signals as modest and intermediate-level risk factors rather than strong drivers.

Comparative weighting within each participant’s population frame
- For Participant 1 the strongest indicators (severe anxiety, very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy) are both large in magnitude for the individual and have very strong sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.81 and NGSE r = −0.66). Several other markers (pain, elevated resting HR, very short/irregular recorded sleep) converge on the same inference. The summary explicitly concludes P1 is likely above the study mean (21.12).
- For Participant 2 the objective fragmentation metrics that link to higher PSS have only modest correlations with PSS in that cohort, and the participant also shows multiple strong protective psychosocial and behavioral signals (low depressive symptoms, high self‑esteem and happiness, regular and sufficient wearable sleep, frequent exercise, low substance use). The summary explicitly concludes P2 is likely near or modestly below the study mean (21.62).

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence strongly favors Participant 1 as having the worse overall perceived stress relative to their study population: multiple high‑weight, concordant indicators (especially severe anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) point to above‑mean PSS for P1, whereas Participant 2’s stress‑related signals are weaker/modest and counterbalanced by several protective factors that keep them near or below their population mean.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z ≈ +0.56). STAI has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31) and is the single strongest psychological risk signal in this profile.
- Circadian fragmentation / intradaily variability (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.39; interdaily stability slightly reduced). These metrics correlate positively (albeit weakly) with PSS and suggest day‑time fluctuation in activity/arousal.
- Pronounced daytime heart‑rate elevations in late morning (hourly deviations Z ≈ +1.9–2.1), consistent with sustained daytime arousal or demand.
- Low reported social/recreational downtime (very low socializing minutes), which could reduce social buffering and contribute to perceived stress.

Mitigating factors for Participant 1 (reduce likelihood of high PSS)
- Strong protective signals: very good objective and subjective sleep (PSQI = 4; median sleep ≈ 8h49m, Z ≈ +2.03), frequent exercise, no substance use, high academic functioning, positive health/happiness ratings, low resting HR. These strongly counterbalance the risk signals and the summary explicitly rates this profile as “near to slightly above” the population mean rather than markedly elevated.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 8) and this measure has the largest correlation with PSS in the dataset (r = 0.77), making it a very strong predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor self‑reported sleep (PSQI = 13, disturbed sleep) with substantial correlation with PSS (r = 0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z ≈ +0.63) and pain/interference (PEG-3), both of which correlate moderately-strongly with PSS (emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; PEG r ≈ 0.44).
- Wearable-derived markers of physiological activation and circadian disruption: high resting HR (Z ≈ +1.19) and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.24), reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -1.05), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.07), low interdaily stability—consistent with nocturnal/early-morning hyperarousal and blunted day–night rhythm.
- Objective sleep pattern showing extremely short median nightly sleep (median ≈ 1h39m, Z ≈ -1.27), very late sleep start (~04:36 AM), and naps—patterns that align with elevated perceived stress and nocturnal hyperarousal (noting possible artifact caveat below).

Mitigating factors for Participant 2 (reduce likelihood of very extreme PSS)
- GAD-7 is in the mild range rather than moderate/severe.
- Low substance‑abuse score and some remaining self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44).
- Some wearable-to-PSS correlations are weak or mixed, and the extremely short objective sleep could reflect device non‑wear or artifact (the summary flags this as a possibility).

Comparative reasoning (taking the within-population frames into account)
- Each description is framed relative to its own sample mean: Participant 1 is characterized as near-to-slightly-above their population mean PSS (21.62) with one modest psychological risk (trait anxiety) but multiple strong protective factors (excellent sleep, exercise, fitness, academic success). The risk signals are relatively modest in magnitude.
- Participant 2 is characterized as above their population mean PSS (21.08) with several strong, converging predictors of higher PSS: anxiety measures that are highly correlated with PSS (r = 0.77), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI 13), elevated emotional lability and pain interference, and physiological/circadian markers showing marked activation and fragmentation (RHR/MESOR Z > +1, amplitude down, intradaily variability up). Even accounting for some mixed correlations and the potential artifact in objective sleep duration, the number, magnitude, and intercorrelation of indicators pointing toward elevated stress are greater for Participant 2 than for Participant 1.
- In short: Participant 1 shows a mixed but largely resilient profile with only modest upward pressure on perceived stress; Participant 2 shows multiple strong, convergent risk signals that point to higher-than-average perceived stress within their cohort.

7,23270,15,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z ≈ +0.56). STAI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), so this is a meaningful risk signal.
- Some circadian fragmentation / intradaily variability (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.39; interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.24), which has a small positive relation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Pronounced daytime HR elevations in mid-morning (hourly deviations ~+19 bpm), suggesting repeated daytime physiological activation consistent with greater perceived demand or arousal.
- Low self‑reported social/recreational time, which could reduce buffering against stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ +0.67) and extremely short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) with large night‑to‑night variability (sleep-duration SD Z ≈ +0.89). In this dataset PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53), making sleep disturbance a strong predictor of higher PSS.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale Z ≈ +2.34), an important contextual stressor even if its within-sample correlation with PSS is weaker.
- Dampened circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (e.g., amplitude Z ≈ −0.84; interdaily stability Z ≈ −1.05), consistent with disrupted daily structure that commonly accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Evening physiological activation pattern may reflect behavioral/psychophysiological dysregulation that can accompany stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Magnitude of risk signals: Participant 2 shows more extreme risk markers relative to their cohort (very short objective sleep, high night-to-night variability, and a large interpersonal-strain Z ≈ +2.34). Participant 1’s largest risk signal is a modestly elevated trait anxiety (Z ≈ +0.56) and some intraday variability; these are smaller in magnitude.
- Strength of predictors (sample correlations): Sleep disturbance (PSQI) in Participant 2 has a stronger sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53) than trait anxiety does in Participant 1 (r ≈ 0.31), which increases the weight of Participant 2’s sleep problems when forecasting PSS.
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has multiple strong protective signals (excellent objective and subjective sleep, frequent exercise, no substance use, high academic functioning, low resting HR). These substantially offset their modest risk signs. Participant 2 does have protective signs (very low current anxiety, low pain, near‑average self‑efficacy, lower resting HR), but these appear less able to offset the severity of their sleep deprivation and pronounced interpersonal strain—especially given the strong link between sleep disturbance and PSS in this sample.

Overall balance and decision
- Both summaries conclude each participant is near the population mean with a modest tilt above it. However, weighting signal magnitude and the strength of the sample-level associations, Participant 2’s severe and sample-relevant sleep disturbance plus high interpersonal-strain Z-score provide stronger evidence of higher perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 1’s modest anxiety elevation does relative to theirs.
- Therefore, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress) relative to their study population.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified as disturbed sleep); PSQI correlates positively (though modestly) with PSS in this sample.  
- Very late sleep timing: median sleep start ≈ 01:27 AM, which can be associated with stress-related schedule misalignment.  
- Low social/leisure engagement: socializing Z = -2.20 (very low relative to the sample), which can reduce social support and increase perceived stress.  
- Lower momentary happiness: “Happy” Z ≈ -0.53, modestly associated with higher PSS.  
- Behavioral hints of coping/demand: moderate alcohol use and high frequency of group exercise (ambiguous — could reflect coping or added social/performance demands).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Strong self-report predictors of higher stress: moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 score, z = 0.93). In this dataset these have large positive correlations with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.77 for anxiety, r ≈ 0.67 for emotional lability).  
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI ≈ 13.5 (disturbed sleep) with a substantial correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE z = -0.62, and NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.66), indicating vulnerability to higher perceived stress.  
- Somatic/functional burden: pain interference (PEG-3 ≈ 5.0) and PAPAS signals that commonly increase stress appraisal (r-values moderate).  
- Wearable indicators consistent with elevated arousal or instability: high resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ +1.2–1.3), large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD z = +1.12). These features align with higher stress in the sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame:
- Participant 1’s description emphasizes strong, convergent physiological resilience signals (robust circadian amplitude and stability, normal resting HR, adequate objective sleep duration) and low trait symptom burden (CES-D, STAI below mean). The indicators that point upward (PSQI, late timing, low social time) are present but described as modest contributors with only modest correlations to PSS in that sample. The authors conclude P1’s PSS is near the population mean, slightly below on balance.
- Participant 2’s description centers on multiple self-report variables that are both elevated and are among the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (notably anxiety, PSQI, emotional lability, and low self-efficacy). Wearable measures are mixed but include some stress-consistent signals (high resting HR, high sleep variability). The authors conclude P2’s PSS is above the population mean, and this inference relies on predictors strongly correlated with PSS in that cohort.

Overall balance of evidence:
- The evidence for higher perceived stress in Participant 2 is stronger and more direct: several elevated self-report measures that have large correlations with PSS in that study, plus some corroborating wearable signs.  
- Participant 1 shows some stress-relevant problems (subjective sleep complaints, late timing, low social time) but these are outweighed by multiple physiological and trait indicators associated with lower PSS; the report explicitly places P1 near or slightly below their study mean.  
- Because each description is interpreted relative to its own population mean, we should not compare raw population means across studies; rather, we compare how convincingly each profile points above its own mean.

15,50766,15,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (""disturbed sleep""), which correlates positively with PSS in the sample.
- Very late sleep timing: median sleep start ≈ 01:27 AM — timing mismatch can reflect circadian/social stressors and relate to higher PSS.
- Low social/leisure engagement: socializing Z = -2.20, indicating limited social support or restorative time that can increase perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness: ""Happy"" Z ≈ -0.53, modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Ambiguous behavioral coping/demands: moderate alcohol use (Z ≈ +1.0) and frequent group exercise (Z = +1.23) could reflect coping with or exposure to social/performance demands.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Marked subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 15.5 (Z = 0.67), with a strong sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- High pain/functional interference: PAPAS = 81 (Z ≈ 0.93), also strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z = -0.62, and NGSE correlates strongly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so this is a strong risk factor.
- Elevated nocturnal physiology and resting tone: mesor and RHR above mean (Z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and notable night-time HR elevations (Zs up to ≈ 1.38) — these wearable markers correlate with higher PSS.
- Reduced interdaily stability and late acrophase: IS Z = -0.83 and late peak timing, both weakly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Multiple signals converging on stress (subjective, functional, physiological) with relatively large sample correlations.

Comparative reasoning (within-frame)
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are physiological and trait-level protective factors (high circadian stability/amplitude, normal RHR, adequate objective sleep, low trait depression/anxiety, higher self-esteem). The higher-PSS indicators for Participant 1 are mainly subjective/behavioral (PSQI, late timing, low social time) and have modest associations with PSS in the sample. Overall the profile was assessed as near the sample mean with a slight tilt below it.
- Participant 2 shows several strong, converging risk indicators for elevated PSS: high PSQI and PAPAS with substantial sample correlations to PSS, low NGSE which is strongly inversely correlated with PSS, plus objective nocturnal HR elevations and reduced day-to-day regularity. Although there are some mitigating features (lower GAD-7, long objective sleep), the number, strength, and intermodal consistency of Participant 2’s risk signals outweigh the protections.
- The two population means are very similar (21.62 vs 21.29), so absolute mean differences do not change the comparative inference; the relevant frame is how each participant stands relative to their own cohort. Within those frames, Participant 2’s deviations line up more strongly with higher perceived stress than Participant 1’s deviations do.

Weighted conclusion
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

20,51851,21,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; classified disturbed; Z ≈ +0.59). Poor sleep quality is associated with higher PSS in this cohort.
- Circadian/coupling disruptions: low interdaily stability (0.32, Z ≈ -0.74) and high intradaily variability (0.72, Z ≈ +1.23) indicate irregular daily schedules and within-day fragmentation, which modestly correlate with higher PSS in the dataset.
- High sleep timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 111 min, Z ≈ +0.61) — inconsistent bedtimes that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (evening hours Zs up to ≈ +1.27–1.57), reflecting elevated physiological arousal late in the day that can impair wind-down and increase perceived strain.

Counterpoint within-frame: several relatively strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety STAI-T Z ≈ -0.62, high self-esteem Z ≈ +1.1, high health satisfaction Z ≈ +1.63, frequent exercise Z ≈ +1.07–1.58, very low resting HR Z ≈ -2.03) reduce the likelihood that the participant’s PSS is clearly above their population mean. The summary accordingly places them near the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10). In this cohort GAD-7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ +0.77); this is a high-weight predictor of above-mean PSS.
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; correlation with PSS ≈ +0.49) and very short median recorded sleep (~3 h 55 min). Both strongly link to higher perceived stress.
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86), with moderate correlations with PSS (≈ +0.45–0.49), adding substantial risk for elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9; correlation ≈ +0.66), another strong predictor of PSS in this cohort.
- Wearable-derived circadian signs that align with stress risk: reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -1.51), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.75), and shifted/flattened heart-rate deviations — all modestly associated with higher PSS.

Counterpoint within-frame: notable protective factors are present (high general self-efficacy NGSE = 38, Z ≈ +1.41; NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS, r ≈ -0.68) and relatively low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.9), but the summary judge is that these do not fully offset the multiple strong risk indicators (anxiety, sleep, pain, emotional lability). The summary places this participant above their population mean.

Comparative weighting (explicitly within each study’s mean-frame)
- Strength and number of high-weight predictors: Participant 2 shows multiple, strongly weighted self-report predictors that in this cohort have high correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ +0.77; emotional lability r ≈ +0.66; PSQI r ≈ +0.49; pain measures r ≈ +0.45–0.49). Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are sleep/circadian indices and evening HR, which in this dataset have smaller associations with PSS (e.g., intradaily variability correlation ≈ +0.16; interdaily stability/amplitude correlations ≈ -0.16 to -0.20).
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has several strong protective markers (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, very frequent exercise, very low resting HR) that substantially reduce the likelihood of above-mean PSS in their cohort. Participant 2 also has a major protective factor (high self-efficacy, r ≈ -0.68) but it appears to attenuate rather than fully counterbalance multiple strong risk indicators.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s mixed profile tips toward “near mean” because strong protective psychosocial and behavioral markers counterbalance modest sleep/circadian risk signals. Participant 2’s profile includes several high-weight, concordant risk indicators (clinically meaningful anxiety, severe subjective sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability) that, despite some protection, produce a net signal consistent with above-mean PSS.

Conclusion
On balance of the within-cohort evidence and relative predictor strengths, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

23,51851,17,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (above typical cutoff), Z ≈ +0.59 — a known correlate of higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (0.32, Z ≈ -0.74) and high intradaily variability (0.72, Z ≈ +1.23), which in this dataset modestly associate with higher PSS (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ +0.16).
- Irregular sleep timing: sleep start SD ≈ 111 minutes (Z ≈ +0.61), consistent with behaviors that co-occur with higher stress.
- Elevated evening physiological arousal: several evening hours show positive heart-rate deviations from the mesor (Z up to ≈ +1.57), which can reflect late-day activation that impairs recovery and tends to accompany higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically significant), and in this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep duration: median ~4 h 21 min — severe sleep restriction is strongly plausibly linked to elevated perceived stress or stress-like consequences.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive overnight HR deviations around midnight–2 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation showing a moderately strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- Irregular sleep timing: sleep start SD ≈ 123 minutes (similar to Participant 1), which can accompany higher stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and balance of evidence
- Frames: Participant 1 is described as most consistent with a PSS near their population mean (mean = 21.62). Participant 2 is described as most consistent with a PSS below their population mean (mean = 21.21).
- Strength and direction of signals:
  - Participant 1’s higher-stress signals are principally sleep/circadian disruption and elevated evening HR; those signals in this dataset have small-to-moderate associations with PSS. Countervailing signals (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem/health satisfaction, frequent exercise, very low resting HR) are strong protective markers and drive the integrative conclusion of ""near the mean.""
  - Participant 2’s higher-stress signals are more extreme for sleep (very short objective sleep, high PSQI, and nocturnal HR arousal) and these correlate moderately with PSS. However, Participant 2 also has very strong protective trait signals that are highly predictive of lower PSS in this sample (very low GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77 to PSS, high self-efficacy with r ≈ -0.65) and strong circadian regularity — all of which drove the integrative inference that this participant is likely below their population mean.
- Net comparison: Although Participant 2 shows more severe sleep-related disturbances than Participant 1, the study-specific strength of protective trait signals (especially the very low anxiety score with a large correlation to PSS) is emphasized in the description and leads to an overall inference of below-mean PSS for Participant 2. Participant 1, despite protective traits, is inferred to be near their (slightly higher) population mean because sleep/circadian signals partially offset protections. Taken within each participant’s population frame, Participant 1’s inferred position (near the mean of 21.62) implies a higher relative PSS than Participant 2’s inferred position (below the mean of 21.21).

24,22455,33,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly elevated self-report anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = +1.51). GAD-7 has a very high correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74), making this a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5; Z = +1.65). PSQI is positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.43), supporting higher perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = +1.03; r with PSS = 0.63) and increased pain/functional interference (PEG-3 elevated), both positively associated with PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; NGSE r with PSS = -0.66), indicating reduced coping resources that are linked to higher PSS.
- Convergence of multiple large-effect self-report predictors pointing toward above-mean perceived stress, despite some protective physiology.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularities: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These features are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample (correlations small-to-moderate).
- Shorter and more variable nightly sleep (median ~6h7m, sleep-duration Z ≈ -1.33; variability Z ≈ +0.94), which has small positive correlations with PSS here.
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV Z ≈ +2.54) and unusual large early-morning heart-rate deviations (5–7 AM outliers) that could reflect disrupted sleep or early awakenings; these objective signs can be associated with higher perceived stress (though correlations are modest and interpretation uncertain).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as above their population mean (mean = 20.54); Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean (mean = 21.59). So within their respective cohorts, P1 → higher-than-typical stress; P2 → lower-than-typical stress.
- The strongest predictors of PSS in these data are self-report affective measures. For P1 these are dramatically elevated (GAD-7, PSQI, BASIS-24) and have strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74, BASIS r = 0.63). Those large, high-correlation elevations strongly favor a substantial increase in PSS for P1 relative to their cohort.
- For P2, self-report measures that most strongly predict PSS (STAI-Trait, CES-D, happiness/health ratings) point toward lower perceived stress (e.g., STAI-Trait Z = -1.31; happiness and health Zs are strongly positive). The wearable-derived signals suggesting higher stress in P2 have smaller effect-size correlations with PSS (amplitude r ≈ -0.16; interdaily stability correlations modest), and some wearable anomalies may reflect behavior (early exercise) or artifact.
- In short: P1 shows large-magnitude, high-correlation subjective signals of elevated stress; P2 shows low-magnitude or weaker-correlation objective signals of disruption but robust subjective signals of low stress.

Weighted judgment
- Given the magnitude of P1’s self-report elevations on measures that are strongly predictive of PSS (especially severe GAD-7 and PSQI elevations) versus P2’s profile in which the strongest predictors point toward lower perceived stress and the higher-risk features are weaker objective correlates, Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

19,22455,28,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any evident)
- Wearable-derived circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32) — these objective rhythm disruptions are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Shorter and more variable sleep: median nightly sleep ~6 h 7 min (Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated night-to-night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94) — shorter/variable sleep have small positive correlations with PSS.
- Sedentary/leisure patterns: high TV/internet/music use (TV Z ≈ +2.54) weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Atypical early-morning heart-rate deviations (large positive deviations 5–7 AM) — physiologically atypical and could reflect early awakenings/nocturnal arousal, potentially contributing to stress (interpretation uncertain).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any evident)
- Pronounced subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) — a strong contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Extreme objective sleep deficits and irregularity: median nightly sleep ~2 h 38 min (Z ≈ -0.94), very late sleep onset (03:12 AM), high sleep-onset variability (SD Z ≈ +1.3) — severe short/irregular sleep strongly associated with elevated PSS.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., 1–2 AM Z ≈ +1.17; 3–4 AM Z ≈ +1.59) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety). Anxiety has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78), so even a modestly elevated GAD-7 meaningfully increases likelihood of higher PSS.
- Pain-related interference: PAPAS somewhat elevated and positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.48), providing additional upward pressure on perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation: interdaily stability and autocorrelation are reduced and intradaily variability elevated — combined with nocturnal arousal this pattern is linked to higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study mean: Participant 1’s description concludes they are likely below their study mean PSS (study mean = 21.59), largely because strong self-report protective factors (low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high happiness/health/self-esteem) outweigh objective circadian/sleep signals. The wearable signals that point upward are described as modest or uncertain.
- Participant 2’s description concludes they are likely above their study mean PSS (study mean = 20.75), driven by several converging, moderately-to-strongly PSS-associated signals (poor PSQI, extreme objective short/irregular sleep, nocturnal HR arousal, and moderate anxiety), even though some resilience markers (self-efficacy, low emotional lability) are present.
- Because Participant 1 is characterized as likely below a somewhat higher population mean (21.59) and Participant 2 is characterized as likely above a slightly lower population mean (20.75), the relative directions are opposite and favor Participant 2 having the higher absolute perceived stress. Participant 1’s protective self-report markers are strong and explicitly weighted more heavily in the inference; Participant 2’s risk markers include features with strong sample correlations to PSS (notably anxiety and PSQI) and extreme objective sleep disruption.

Balance of evidence and judgment
- The evidence for higher PSS in Participant 2 is stronger and more convergent on stress-linked modalities: moderate anxiety (highly predictive in this sample), marked subjective sleep problems (PSQI) with corroborating extreme objective short/irregular sleep, and nocturnal physiological arousal. These are explicitly noted as the most salient drivers pushing PSS above that study’s mean.
- Participant 1 shows some objective signs that could raise stress (circadian blunting, shorter sleep), but these are described as modest and inconsistent and are outweighed by robust protective self-report measures that are strongly negatively associated with PSS in that sample.
- Therefore, interpreting each description within its own population frame and weighing the strength and relevance of predictors, Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Large night-to-night sleep variability and very late/irregular sleep timing: sleep duration SD z = 2.75, sleep start median ≈ 03:03, sleep start SD z ≈ 1.21. Sleep variability and delayed timing correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.13–0.17) and are established risk patterns for greater perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian amplitude and blunted/shifted circadian markers: amplitude z = -0.44, MESOR z = -0.60, autocorrelation 24h z ≈ -0.28, with some nocturnal HR deviations modestly associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.21). These indicate circadian instability that is linked to elevated stress.
- Behavioral risk factors: low exercise, more sedentary hobby time (z = 1.41), and relatively frequent beer consumption (z = 1.01) can contribute to or correlate with higher stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not strongly elevated) PSS
- Adequate median sleep duration (~7h; z = -0.13) and low napping (z = -0.86) are neutral/protective.
- Above-average momentary happiness (z = 0.55) and social time (z = 0.95) — both negatively correlated with PSS — and lower resting HR (RHR z = -0.54) could mitigate perceived stress.
- Net characterization in the description: “modestly above” population mean rather than strongly elevated.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Strong self-report predictors with high correlations to PSS: GAD-7 = 7.5 (anxiety; GAD-7 r = 0.80), Emotional Lability = 6.33 (r = 0.67), PSQI = 9 (poor subjective sleep; r = 0.59). These are among the most strongly weighted survey predictors of PSS in the dataset and point toward elevated perceived stress.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55, both positively correlated with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50), adding substantive psychosocial burden.
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations during late-night hours show moderate positive correlations with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with stress-linked autonomic arousal during night.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or not as elevated) PSS
- Robust, regular circadian physiology: amplitude z = 0.95 and 24-h autocorrelation z = 0.91, which correlate negatively with PSS (protective signals).
- Clear daytime cardiovascular activation (negatively correlated with PSS at peak hours), very long objective sleep opportunity (median ≈ 10h11m, z = 1.64), and low napping (z = -1.02) — objective patterns that generally associate with lower PSS in this dataset.
- Self-efficacy near sample mean (NGSE z ≈ -0.07) provides some buffer.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Participant 1’s indicators of higher stress are moderate in magnitude and include elevated trait anxiety (z ≈ 0.76), marked sleep timing variability (very high z = 2.75 for sleep duration SD), and reduced circadian amplitude. However, many of these predictors have only modest correlations with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.13–0.31), and the participant has notable protective signals (happiness, social time, adequate total sleep).
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple self-report measures that both indicate problems and have very strong correlations with PSS in that study (GAD-7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67; PSQI r = 0.59). Although wearable physiology is protective, the survey measures that most strongly predict PSS are elevated and coherent (anxiety, emotional lability, subjective poor sleep, pain), which the description explicitly treats as likely driving an above-mean PSS.
- Because the strongest predictors of PSS in Participant 2’s dataset are highly elevated and have larger effect-size correlations with perceived stress than the elevated predictors in Participant 1’s description, the balance of evidence indicates a larger relative elevation in perceived stress for Participant 2 compared with their peers than for Participant 1 compared with theirs.

- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8.5 (above clinical cutoff) with moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 mean 8.33 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.21; these measures correlate moderately with PSS (PEG-3 r ≈ 0.43; PAPAS r ≈ 0.47).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large positive nocturnal HR deviations around midnight–2am (Z ≈ 1.25–1.36) that are meaningfully correlated with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Sleep timing variability/fragmentation: Night-to-night sleep SD elevated (Z ≈ 0.65), also associated with higher PSS.  
- (Counterpoints/protective but secondary): Some protective markers (self-efficacy only slightly above average, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR, low substance use) but their z-scores or correlations to PSS are smaller or protective; they moderate but do not outweigh the multiple strong positive predictors above.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI trait z = 0.76 (STAI r ≈ 0.31 with PSS) and CES-D z = 0.28 (CES-D r ≈ 0.28). These are positive predictors but have more modest correlations with PSS than P1’s GAD-7.  
- Very high sleep timing variability and late/irregular timing: sleep duration SD z = 2.75 (large deviation), sleep start median ≈ 03:03 and start SD z ≈ 1.21. Sleep variability and late timing are associated with higher PSS in the dataset, though their correlations with PSS are modest (~0.13–0.17).  
- Reduced circadian amplitude and blunted rhythm (amplitude z ≈ -0.44, MESOR z ≈ -0.60, autocorrelation slightly low) and behavioral risk factors (low exercise, sedentary hobby z = 1.41, beer consumption z ≈ 1.01) that weakly associate with higher stress.  
- (Counterpoints/protective): Adequate median sleep duration (~7 h), no naps, above-average momentary happiness (z ≈ 0.55), above-average social time (z ≈ 0.95), and low resting HR (z ≈ -0.54). These are moderate protective signals that can buffer stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Strength and number of high-relevance predictors: Participant 1 presents multiple relatively strong predictors that are known to correlate substantially with PSS in that study (notably GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77, PSQI with r ≈ 0.55, pain measures r ≈ 0.43–0.47, and nocturnal HR deviations r ≈ 0.40). These are both clinically meaningful (GAD-7 and PSQI exceed clinical cutoffs) and statistically strong correlates of PSS in P1’s dataset.  
- By contrast, Participant 2’s strongest psychological predictors (STAI, CES-D) have only modest correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and the very large sleep variability (SD z = 2.75) is a strong deviation in magnitude but is linked to PSS with only modest correlations in that dataset (~0.13–0.17). Several of P2’s signals that look concerning (late timing, variability, lower amplitude) thus have weaker per-measure predictive strength for PSS than P1’s top predictors.  
- Protective factors are present in both cases, but they are relatively similar in magnitude and do not appear to negate P1’s multiple strong positive indicators. P2 has some stronger social/happiness buffers which further reduce the net elevation of PSS compared with P1.

Overall balance of evidence
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means, but Participant 1’s profile contains multiple, strongly PSS-associated clinical signals (clinically elevated anxiety, clinically disturbed sleep, elevated pain interference, and corroborating nocturnal HR arousal) that together weigh more heavily toward higher perceived stress than Participant 2’s set of more modestly correlated indicators (trait anxiety/depression of smaller effect, late/variable sleep with modest PSS correlations, and some behavioral risks partially offset by social/happiness buffers).

Sleep duration/irregularity are positively correlated with PSS in this sample and could elevate perceived stress.
- Nocturnal/early-morning physiological signals: pronounced nocturnal HR nadir plus some early-morning HR deviations (3–6 AM) that have small positive correlations with PSS in the study.
- Modest circadian fragmentation signals (sleep variability, small positive IV/PSS correlations) that act as countervailing risk factors despite other strengths.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Severe anxiety and very poor subjective sleep: GAD‑7 = 16.5 (Z = 1.25, severe) and PSQI = 16 (Z = 0.83). Both measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD r ≈ 0.81, PSQI r ≈ 0.51), making them high-weight indicators of elevated perceived stress.
- Low self‑efficacy and pain interference: NGSE below mean (Z = -0.62; NGSE r ≈ -0.66 with PSS) and moderate pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS), both associated with higher PSS.
- Physiological arousal and highly abnormal wearable sleep: elevated resting HR and mesor (HR ≈ 79.8 bpm, Z = 1.53; mesor Z = 1.49) consistent with sustained arousal, plus very short median wearable sleep (2h31m, Z ≈ -0.97), late and highly variable sleep starts (SD 254 min, Z = 0.98). These converge with subjective reports to indicate marked sleep/physiologic disturbance.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each summary is explicitly relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.62, P2 mean = 21.12). Both means are similar, but the evidence strength differs: Participant 1’s deviations that push toward higher stress are primarily sleep-related and modest in magnitude, while multiple low-weight-to-moderate-weight risk factors are strongly offset by robust protective factors (very low trait anxiety/depression, high self‑esteem/happiness, frequent exercise, low resting HR).
- Participant 2 shows multiple high-weight indicators that consistently point upward relative to their sample: severe anxiety (highly predictive of PSS in that study), very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy (a strong inverse correlate), pain interference, and elevated baseline HR. These signals are concordant across modalities and have larger effect sizes/correlations with PSS in that dataset than the sleep signals do for Participant 1.
- The balance of evidence therefore favors Participant 2 as having the higher perceived stress score relative to their study population; Participant 1 appears to be below their sample mean despite some sleep risks.

- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures showing positive correlations with PSS — both plausible contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian instability: low interdaily stability and amplitude (Z ≈ -1.42, -1.10) and low autocorrelation, which in this sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Although there are protective signals (very high self-efficacy, lower resting HR), the strongest, highly correlated measures point toward elevated stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s risk signals are primarily sleep-related and modest in effect size (small correlations with PSS, moderate Z-scores). These are outweighed by multiple strong protective factors (very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms; high self-esteem and happiness; frequent exercise), which have larger correlations with PSS in the sample and substantial negative Z deviations. The net inference made in the description is that P1 is below their study mean PSS.
- Participant 2 presents multiple extreme and convergent risk indicators that are strongly correlated with PSS in that study: objectively and subjectively severe sleep loss/irregularity, elevated anxiety/emotional lability with large correlations to PSS, substance-related difficulties, and circadian disruption. While P2 has a strong protective factor (high self-efficacy), the magnitude and number of high-PSS-correlated risk factors are greater and more extreme than P1’s risks.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The quantity, extremity, and stronger sample correlations of P2’s risk features (especially the near-total sleep deprivation pattern and highly PSS-correlated anxiety/emotional-lability scores) outweigh P2’s protections and outweigh the comparatively modest, primarily sleep-focused risks in P1.
- Therefore Participant 2 is much more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their study population mean.

21,87032,30,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their description)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 12, z = +0.46) with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.77) — a strong predictor of higher perceived stress despite only moderate z-score.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, z = +1.32) which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: several overnight hourly heart-rate deviations above the sample mean (e.g., midnight–3am z ≈ +0.7 to +1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) and emotional lability (BASIS-24) traits that are linked to higher PSS (NGSE correlation ≈ −0.66; BASIS-24 emotional lability r ≈ 0.68).
- Some substance-related elevation (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse z ≈ +1.5), which could be stress-relevant (though noted to have negligible correlation with PSS in this dataset).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their description)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D z ≈ +1.53), a substantial psychological burden that is positively associated with PSS.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ +1.52) with late and highly variable sleep timing (sleep start ~02:00, start-time SD z ≈ +1.36).
- Broad circadian and activity dysregulation: very low 24-hour autocorrelation (z ≈ −1.87), low interdaily stability (z ≈ −1.15), and high intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.44) — a cohesive pattern linked to poorer stress-related outcomes.
- Elevated average cardiac tone (MESOR z ≈ +1.56) and higher resting HR (z ≈ +1.34), both indicating sustained physiological arousal and both positively correlated with PSS.
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ +0.27) which also correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective sample PSS means. The question is which shows a stronger pattern, relative to their own sample.
- Participant 1’s strongest single statistical link to PSS is anxiety (very high correlation r ≈ 0.77) but the anxiety z-score is only moderate (+0.46). Participant 1 also has a very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI z ≈ +1.32) and some nocturnal HR elevations, but several physiological markers (lower resting HR, preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation, adequate objective sleep duration, low pain) are neutral or protective.
- Participant 2 displays multiple large-magnitude deviations across psychological and physiological domains (CES-D, PSQI, MESOR, resting HR, intradaily variability, 24-h autocorr), many with z-scores in the +1.3 to +1.9 range. These deviations form a coherent pattern of depressive symptoms, severe sleep disturbance/irregular timing, circadian fragmentation, and elevated cardiac tone — together providing convergent, multi-domain evidence for elevated perceived stress relative to that study’s population.
- Although Participant 1 has a very strong PSS correlate (GAD-7) and pronounced subjective sleep dysfunction, Participant 2’s abnormalities are broader (more domains), larger in magnitude, and include overt physiological arousal and circadian fragmentation that are themselves correlated with PSS. This breadth and magnitude of elevations suggests a higher relative PSS burden for Participant 2 than for Participant 1 within their respective populations.

16,87032,23,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s population frame)
- Elevated subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 12), which correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.50).
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = +0.53), which has a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal: elevated heart rate during 1–4 AM and elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = +1.37; mesor z = +1.18) — these physiological markers correlate positively (though modestly) with PSS.
- Very long median sleep duration (12 h) and high night-to-night sleep variability (both z > +2), which can reflect dysregulation often associated with stress even if wearable-sleep correlations with PSS are weak in this sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ +1.53) and modestly elevated trait anxiety; depression/anxiety measures correlate positively with PSS.
- Pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI z ≈ +1.52) plus late and variable sleep timing (sleep start ≈ 02:00, start-time SD z ≈ +1.36).
- Objective circadian/behavioral dysregulation: low interdaily stability (z ≈ −1.15), very low 24‑hr autocorrelation (z ≈ −1.87), and high intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.44), indicating fragmented/irregular daily rhythms linked to worse stress-related outcomes.
- Elevated mean cardiac level (MESOR z ≈ +1.56) and higher resting HR (z ≈ +1.34), consistent with sustained physiological arousal associated with higher perceived stress.
- Multiple indicators here are moderate-to-large z-scores and align consistently across psychological self-report and wearable physiology.

Comparative reasoning (accounting for within-population frames)
- Participant 1 is characterized as overall near their study mean PSS; risk signals are domain-specific (sleep disturbance, emotional lability, nocturnal HR) but counterbalanced by several protective factors (low pain, good interpersonal functioning, low substance issues, only mild anxiety). Several wearable/circadian metrics have weak correlations with PSS in that study, weakening the inference of a substantially elevated PSS.
- Participant 2 is characterized as above their study mean PSS, with multiple converging and relatively large signals (depression, PSQI, MESOR, intradaily variability, very low 24‑hr autocorrelation) that are each meaningfully associated with PSS in that study. Protective factors are present but smaller in magnitude and do not offset the weighted risk pattern.
- Although the two populations’ mean PSS values are similar (20.96 vs 21.6), the relevant comparison is within each participant’s study frame. Within those frames, Participant 2 shows a clearer, stronger, and more consistent set of indicators pointing above the population mean, whereas Participant 1’s profile is mixed and centered near their mean.

19,25197,28,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86). In this dataset STAI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), so this is a meaningful stress-related signal.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and objectively shortened sleep (median 6 h 34 min, Z = -0.77), both of which are commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:45) and below-average momentary happiness (Current Happy Z = -0.53), modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Net within-sample framing: these factors push toward somewhat higher PSS, but the effect is moderated by countervailing signals (below).

Protective/offsetting signals in Participant 1 (reduce likelihood of very high PSS)
- Low resting heart rate (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68) and robust circadian amplitude (Amplitude Z = 0.64) with low intradaily variability (Z = -0.53) — physiological signs associated with resilience.
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = -0.34), high self-esteem (Z ≈ 0.82), high health satisfaction (Z = 1.63), minimal substance use — these traits tend to lower perceived stress.
- Net interpretation provided in the summary: mixed evidence but overall near-to-slightly-above the cohort mean PSS (i.e., modest elevation at most).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Very pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16.5, Z = 1.0). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r = 0.47).
- Extreme objective sleep deficit and irregularity (median nightly sleep 2 h 38 min, Z = -0.94; median sleep start ≈ 03:12; night-to-night sleep onset SD Z = 1.3). These are severe departures that typically increase perceived stress.
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (e.g., 1–2 AM mean HR deviation +13.54 bpm, Z = 1.17; 3–4 AM +9.79 bpm, Z = 1.59). Overnight HR elevations have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38) in this dataset — physiologic evidence supporting higher stress.
- Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10). Importantly, GAD-7 shows a very strong correlation with PSS here (r = 0.78), so even a moderate clinical-level anxiety score is a highly weighty predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Pain-related interference (PAPAS) shows positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.48) and is slightly elevated.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (interdaily stability Z = -0.68; intradaily variability Z = 0.92) consistent with dysregulation linked to higher PSS.
- Protective/offsetting signals: above-average self-efficacy (Z = 0.3, r = -0.68) and low emotional lability (Z = -0.97) buffer stress, but do not fully counterbalance the strong sleep/anxiety signals.
- Net within-sample framing: summary explicitly concludes perceived stress is likely above the study mean, and many of the strongest predictors of PSS in this dataset (GAD-7, PSQI, nocturnal HR, pain) point upward.

Comparative weighting and conclusion
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s most predictive measures (GAD-7 r = 0.78; PSQI r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.48; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.32–0.38) are either more strongly correlated with PSS or more extreme in magnitude than Participant 1’s primary stress signals (STAI r ≈ 0.31; PSQI and sleep disruption less severe).
- Severity/magnitude: Participant 2 shows extreme sleep restriction (≈2.6 h/night) and substantial nocturnal physiological arousal—objectively large deviations—whereas Participant 1’s sleep shortening is moderate (~6.5 h) and many strong protective signals (low RHR, robust circadian amplitude, low depression, high self-esteem) are present.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s profile is mixed and likely near-to-slightly-above their population mean PSS; Participant 2’s profile contains multiple, strong, and convergent drivers of elevated PSS and is explicitly judged above their population mean in the summary.

- Low perceived coping resources (NGSE z = -1.55), a strong negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.66), which increases vulnerability to higher perceived stress.
- Objective wearable corroboration of nocturnal hyperarousal and rhythm disruption: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m, z = -0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), flattened circadian amplitude (z = -1.4), high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low 24h autocorrelation (z = -1.4).

- Multiple indicators are both elevated and have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in this sample, producing a consistent picture above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 50; z = 0.86), a moderate positive correlate of PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and somewhat shortened wearable sleep duration (6 h 34 min; z = -0.77) and late habitual sleep timing (~01:45), all of which are associated with higher PSS in this cohort.
- Lower momentary happiness (z ≈ -0.53), modestly associated with greater perceived stress.
- The above risk signals together point toward psychosocial strain that could raise PSS relative to peers.

Comparative evaluation within each study frame
- Convergence and strength: Participant 1 shows multiple, strongly correlated self-report (especially high GAD-7) and wearable markers that converge on elevated PSS; several of these markers have sizable z-scores and direct positive correlations with PSS. Participant 2’s risk indicators are fewer and more moderate in magnitude (trait anxiety and some sleep disturbance), and their correlations with PSS are weaker than the key correlations reported for Participant 1.
- Countervailing protective signals: Participant 2 has several robust physiological and psychosocial protective signals (low resting HR, above-average circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and health satisfaction) that plausibly reduce their perceived stress relative to the cohort. Participant 1’s description contains fewer protective signals and more direct physiological evidence of nocturnal arousal tied to PSS.
- Population SD/context: Participant 1’s inferred elevation is described relative to a population with larger SD (mean 20.92, SD 7.51) but the underlying indicators (strong correlations and extreme behavioral/physiological disruption) are compelling. Participant 2’s mean SD is smaller (mean 21.61, SD 3.68), but the net profile was judged near-to-slightly-above the mean rather than clearly elevated.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Overall, Participant 1 presents a more consistent and stronger set of risk indicators (severe anxiety, very short/late sleep, circadian flattening, nocturnal HR elevations, low self-efficacy) that are directly tied to higher PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 shows some stress-related features (trait anxiety, shorter sleep), but these are counterbalanced by objective physiological resilience and positive psychosocial assets, yielding a profile nearer to the cohort mean.

- Severe self-reported anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = +1.25). In this dataset GAD‑7 is a very strong positive correlate of PSS (r = 0.81), so this is a high‑weight indicator of above‑mean perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83). PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.51), and subjective sleep disturbance corroborates physiological signals.
- Low generalized self-efficacy (NGSE = 27; Z = -0.62), a strong inverse correlate of PSS (r = -0.66), which increases likelihood of above‑mean PSS.
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS elevated) that correlates moderately with PSS (~0.44–0.48), adding psychosocial strain.
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular indices (resting HR 79.8 bpm, mesor elevated; Z ≈ +1.5), consistent with sustained physiological arousal that aligns with higher stress.
- Short, late, and variable wearable sleep timing (median recorded sleep very short; late median sleep start and high sleep‑start variability), behaviorally concordant with elevated stress.
- Emotional/functional disturbances on BASIS‑24 and substance‑related items provide additional convergent psychosocial evidence for elevated stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean = 21.62)
- Objectively short sleep (median nightly ~5 h 57 m; Z = -1.53) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6) — both are risk markers that tend to co-occur with higher PSS.
- Markedly delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:34) and circadian irregularity: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.57), low 24‑hr autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.78), and elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.60). These wearable features modestly correlate with PSS and represent risk for higher perceived stress.
- Evening increases in hourly HR deviations suggesting later-day arousal that may align with delayed sleep and sleep onset problems.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or near-mean) PSS score
- Low trait anxiety (STAI = 28; Z = -1.31) and minimal depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 2; Z = -1.18) — strong psychometric protections against elevated PSS.
- Elevated positive psychosocial markers (high happiness Z = +1.64, above-average self-esteem Z = +1.10, health satisfaction) which typically predict lower PSS.
- Low resting heart rate (47.35 bpm; Z = -1.28), consistent with lower chronic physiological arousal/greater fitness.
- Healthy lifestyle behaviors: frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), low substance use, modest alcohol, high GPA — all associated with lower stress vulnerability.
- The original synthesis judged these protective signals to outweigh the sleep/circadian risks, concluding PSS likely near or slightly below the population mean.

Comparative within-population reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Participant 1: Multiple high‑weight, convergent indicators (very high GAD‑7, very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy, elevated resting HR, pain/interference) are all known in this dataset to correlate substantially with PSS. The synthesis explicitly concludes P1 is likely above their population mean (21.12).
- Participant 2: Evidence is mixed. Strong protective psychosocial signals (low anxiety/depression, high happiness/self‑esteem, exercise, low resting HR) are present and were judged to likely result in PSS near or modestly below their population mean (21.62), despite notable sleep/circadian risks.
- Strength and convergence favor Participant 1 as having the worse overall perceived stress: P1’s top predictors of PSS are both strong and concordant, whereas P2’s strongest signals are protective and offset their wearable‑based sleep/circadian risk. Even accounting for each description being relative to its own study mean, the balance of evidence indicates P1 > population mean by several converging markers, while P2 is judged near or slightly below their mean.

- Substantially elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z = 2.34), a salient contextual risk factor that commonly increases perceived stress.
- Blunted/dampened circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.05) with irregular daily schedule — a pattern that often accompanies greater stress or poorer coping.
- Evening heart-rate elevations and disrupted circadian physiology that co-occur with the sleep/circadian disruptions (though these physiological markers are not perfectly correlated with PSS in the sample).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Objectively short median nightly sleep (~5 h 57 m; z = -1.53) and PSQI = 6 (classified as disturbed sleep), both associated with higher PSS.
- Marked delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:34) and circadian irregularity (reduced interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, elevated intradaily variability) — these wearable markers modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Some evening heart-rate elevations that temporally align with delayed sleep onset, possibly reflecting later-day arousal.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s population context)
- Both participants show sleep/circadian risk markers for higher PSS, but Participant 1’s sleep disruption is substantially more severe (median sleep ≈ 4h22 versus Participant 2’s ≈ 5h57) and is paired with very high interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 z = 2.34). Those features are strong stress-related signals in Participant 1’s profile.
- Participant 2’s sleep/circadian risks are notable but less extreme, and are counterbalanced by multiple strong protective signals (low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, frequent exercise, low resting HR). The study’s holistic inference for Participant 2 was “near or modestly below the mean,” whereas for Participant 1 it was “near the mean with a modest tilt above.”
- The two populations’ mean PSS values are nearly the same (21.29 vs 21.62), so cross-study baseline differences do not materially change the comparative interpretation. Given relative magnitudes of risk vs protective markers within each participant’s study, Participant 1 presents a stronger net signal toward elevated perceived stress than Participant 2.

- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63), which correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.66).
- Pain-related interference and related scores with moderate correlations to PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Wearable indicators of physiological activation and circadian dysregulation: elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.2), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ -1.05), higher intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.07), and very short median nightly sleep (median 1 h 39 m, Z ≈ -1.27) — all consistent with hyperarousal/stress.
- Multiple independent signals (self-report and wearables) point above the study mean; several of these measures have high sample correlations with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV Z = 1.51) indicating circadian/within-day fragmentation that is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.17).
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (10–11 pm +22.05 bpm, Z = 2.46), suggesting late-day physiological arousal linked to stress/rumination.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.2), both of which are associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Some hourly early-morning HR deviations modestly correlated with PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is anchored to its own study mean: Participant 1 is interpreted in the summary as likely above their population mean (mean = 21.08). Participant 2 is interpreted as near the population mean and leaning slightly below it (mean = 21.62).
- Strength and number of high-PSS correlates: Participant 1 shows several strong, highly correlated self-report indicators (anxiety r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66; low self-efficacy r = -0.65; PSQI r = 0.49), plus supporting wearable signs of persistent hyperarousal and circadian disruption. Participant 2’s indicators of higher stress are more circadian/temporal (high IV, evening HR peaks, PSQI = 6), but they also have multiple protective factors strongly predictive of lower PSS (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem, adequate objective sleep, low resting HR).
- Magnitude and coherence: Participant 1’s risk signals are coherent across subjective symptom scales that have high predictive correlations with PSS and are supported by physiological markers. Participant 2 has one or two strong wearable anomalies (very high evening HR, high IV) but overall trait and objective sleep/physiology lean protective or neutral.
- Caveats: Participant 1’s extremely short median sleep may reflect device non-wear or artifact (noted in the summary), and some wearable-to-PSS correlations were mixed; Participant 2’s elevated evening HR and IV are notable but exist alongside low depression/anxiety and good average sleep.

Overall balance of evidence
- On balance, Participant 1 presents a stronger, more consistent set of indicators associated with higher perceived stress relative to their sample mean (notably highly correlated anxiety and emotional-lability signals plus physiological hyperarousal). Participant 2 shows some signals of momentary/circadian arousal but overall has stronger protective indicators and is characterized as near-to-slightly-below their sample mean.
- Therefore Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) when reasoning within each participant’s study-frame.

Sample correlation with PSS for PSQI ≈ 0.48; short/late sleep patterns are commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z = +1.33; PAPAS Z = +0.43), with moderate sample correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5), supporting greater stress related to bodily pain.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: notable late-night/early-morning heart-rate elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67; 1–2 AM r with PSS ≈ 0.43), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.34), and lower 24-h autocorrelation — wearable signals that in this sample are meaningfully associated with higher PSS.
- Convergence: multiple moderate-to-strong PSS-linked indicators (sleep, pain, nocturnal HR) converge, favoring an above-mean PSS classification for this participant.

Protective/countervailing factors to note (reduce certainty)
- Low anxiety (GAD-7 = 4.5; Z ≈ -0.85) and high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86). GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.77), so these are substantial buffers.
- Low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97) and near-average resting HR and some rhythm metrics.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Circadian/within-day instability: high intradaily variability (IV Z = +1.51) and lower interdaily stability, which are associated with higher PSS (IV r ≈ 0.17; IS r ≈ -0.12). This indicates fragmented activity/HR rhythms.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation: very large deviation at 10–11 pm (+22 bpm, Z ≈ 2.46) and elevated afternoon/evening HR, which can reflect evening physiological arousal linked to stress (some hourly deviations modestly correlate with PSS).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, “disturbed sleep”) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.2), both of which are associated with higher perceived stress in the sample.

Protective/countervailing factors
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z ≈ -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI-T = 31, Z ≈ -1.02); these scales have positive correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31) and thus strongly argue for lower stress.
- High self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ +1.1), regular exercise, adequate and regular objective sleep (median 7 h 34 m, low night-to-night variability), and relatively low resting HR (55.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.33).

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both descriptions are relative to their own study means; the small difference in population means (21.21 vs 21.62) is negligible for comparative inference.
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as “above the population mean” with multiple large, convergent indicators that have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS (notably sleep disturbance, short sleep, pain, nocturnal HR elevations).
- Participant 2 is characterized as “near the mean, leaning slightly below,” with the strongest risk signals being circadian fragmentation and evening HR spikes; however, those risk features have weaker sample-level correlations with PSS (e.g., IV r ≈ 0.17) and are offset by several robust protective factors (low depression/anxiety, good objective sleep, exercise, high self-esteem).
- Overall balance: Participant 1 shows stronger and more numerous PSS-linked risk signals that outweigh protective factors sufficiently to be classified above mean in their sample. Participant 2 shows mixed signals but overall leans at/below their sample mean.

Protective factors noted (temper increased stress): relatively high self‑efficacy (z = 0.3, r with PSS = -0.65), no substance problems (z = -1.62), normative resting HR, long median sleep duration — but the summary weighed predictors and still favored slightly above‑mean stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.62)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (disturbed), with median wearable sleep short (6 h 37 m, z = -0.70) and very late sleep timing (~02:25), which can be associated with higher stress.
- Some physiological arousal signals: small positive correlations between early‑morning HR deviations and PSS, and small positive correlation of resting/mean HR with PSS.
- Certain behaviors (e.g., high music listening) show small positive correlations with PSS in the cohort and could reflect coping under stress.

However, the description explicitly judges Participant 2’s overall profile as below the population mean, citing several strong protective signals (low CES‑D and STAI‑Trait, high happiness, high interdaily stability and HR amplitude, regular exercise, socializing, no substance use).

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each profile is already framed relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is characterized as likely slightly above their study mean (21.04); Participant 2 is characterized as likely below their study mean (21.62).
- Strength of predictive signals: Participant 1 shows multiple indicators that are both individually and jointly moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS in that cohort (notably anxiety with r = 0.78 and self‑reported poor sleep), which the summary treated as decisive enough to place them above their mean despite some protective factors.
- Participant 2’s adverse signals are mainly sleep timing/quantity and small physiological correlations; the major affective and behavioral indicators (low depression/anxiety, high happiness, strong circadian stability and amplitude, exercise) are robustly indicative of lower PSS in that cohort.
- The population mean difference is small (21.04 vs 21.62) and does not alter the within‑cohort inferences: Participant 1 being above their mean and Participant 2 below theirs implies Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher absolute PSS.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence favors Participant 1 as having the higher perceived stress (more signals strongly associated with increased PSS, and the narrative explicitly places them slightly above their cohort mean, whereas Participant 2 is explicitly placed below theirs).

- Elevated anxiety and emotional lability: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated; both correlate strongly with PSS in this cohort (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.80, BASIS-24 r ≈ 0.66).
- Severe sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (clinically disturbed); extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 m, Z = -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median ≈ 02:49 AM; start-time SD Z = 1.16). Sleep measures that are strongly associated with PSS in this sample.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian disruption: High resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), and marked nocturnal HR elevations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).
- Pain and functional interference: Elevated PEG-3 and pain-related burden measures that correlate positively with PSS.
- Convergent multimodal signals: Several different data streams (self-report anxiety, sleep, HR/circadian metrics, pain) all point in the direction of higher perceived stress.
- (Counterpoint noted in description) Modestly higher self-efficacy (Z = 0.12) is a small protective factor but appears insufficient to offset the above.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean of 21.62)
- Sleep-related concerns: PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), median wearable sleep ≈ 6 h 37 m (Z = -0.70), and late sleep timing (median ~02:25 AM). These factors are known to relate to stress and could raise perceived stress.
- Small nocturnal/early-morning arousal signals: Hourly HR deviations in early-morning hours show modest positive correlations with PSS (correlations ~0.19–0.21); resting/mean HR has a small positive correlation with PSS in the cohort (resting HR correlation ≈ 0.14).
- Some behaviors with small positive associations to PSS (e.g., unusually high music listening), though these associations are small and ambiguous (may reflect coping or lifestyle).

Comparative, within-frame considerations
- Each summary is written relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as likely above their population mean (21.17); Participant 2 is characterized as likely below their population mean (21.62). Those relative judgments are the primary anchors for comparison.
- Magnitude and convergence of signals: Participant 1 shows multiple strong indicators with moderate-to-strong cohort-level correlations with PSS (notably anxiety score r ≈ 0.80, PSQI r ≈ 0.49, nocturnal HR r up to ≈0.42). The deviations (Z-scores) for physiological disturbance in Participant 1 are substantial (e.g., resting HR Z = 1.67; circadian amplitude Z = -1.57; intradaily variability Z = 1.23).
- Participant 2 shows a predominance of protective/low-stress indicators (low CES-D and STAI, high happiness, high interdaily stability Z = 1.33, amplitude Z = 1.06, frequent exercise, no substance use). The sleep-related and small nocturnal HR signals that could increase PSS are modest in size (PSQI only 6, sleep Z ≈ -0.70, HR correlations small).
- The cohort means (21.17 vs 21.62) are very similar, so relative status within each cohort is the most informative factor. Given Participant 1 is inferred above their mean with strong multimodal evidence and Participant 2 is inferred below their mean with multiple robust protective signals, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 exhibits higher perceived stress.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.51) and corroborates wearable indications of disturbed sleep.
- Low generalized self-efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.62), a strong inverse correlate of PSS in this sample (r = −0.66).
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS moderate; correlations ~0.44–0.48) adding psychosocial strain.
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular indices (resting HR 79.8 bpm, Z = +1.53; mesor Z = +1.49) consistent with sustained physiological arousal linked to stress.
- Short/late/irregular recorded sleep timing (wearable median sleep 2 h 31 min, late median sleep start ~01:37, sleep-start SD high), consistent with stress-related sleep disruption.
- Emotional/functional vulnerabilities (slight BASIS‑24 elevations) that align with higher perceived stress.
- Although some circadian regularity is preserved, the converging strong self-report and physiologic signals point toward above-mean PSS in this participant’s study.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated resting heart rate (75.5 bpm; Z = +2.06) — a relatively large physiological deviation that in this study correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.15).
- Substantial circadian disruption on wearables: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.81), low 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.16), and low cosinor amplitude (Z ≈ −1.85). These objective measures have modest positive/negative associations with PSS in the sample and typically accompany higher perceived stress.
- Aggregate hourly HR pattern showing elevated evening/night values and blunted amplitude, compatible with autonomic/circadian perturbation tied to stress.
- Caveat: these physiological markers correlate with PSS only modestly in this dataset and can reflect non-stress factors (fitness, stimulants, illness, schedule), reducing their specificity for perceived stress.

Comparative/integrative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Participant 1: Multiple high-weight, converging indicators of perceived stress come from modalities that strongly predict PSS in that study — notably severe anxiety (very high correlation with PSS), poor subjective sleep (moderate correlation), low self-efficacy (strong inverse correlation), and elevated resting HR. The combination of strong self-report predictors and corroborating physiology makes the inference of above-mean PSS robust.
- Participant 2: Objective physiology shows pronounced deviations associated with higher PSS, but the associations in that dataset are modest. Crucially, self-report measures (CES‑D, STAI, RSES, PSQI, social/functional indicators) consistently indicate low psychological distress and good sleep — the same domain that PSS measures. Because PSS is a subjective scale, strong low self-report symptomatology argues against a substantially above-mean PSS; the wearable signals create uncertainty and support a near-mean inference with a possible mild upward lean.
- Overall balance: Participant 1 presents stronger, converging evidence of elevated perceived stress (including very strong self-report predictors of PSS), whereas Participant 2’s evidence for higher perceived stress rests primarily on physiological markers with weaker links to PSS and is countered by robust self-reported low distress.

- Very severe and objectively corroborated sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), median nightly sleep ~3 h 4 min (extreme short sleep), and very large variability in sleep timing (SD start time Z = +2.82). Sleep measures here are both extreme and strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (PSQI r = 0.50).  
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9 (mild anxiety) and BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability (Z = +0.43); these scales have strong positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (GAD‑7 r = 0.78, emotional lability r = 0.68).  
- Substance‑related problems and pain interference: BASIS‑24 Substance Abuse Z = +1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — plausible contributors to higher perceived stress.  
- Circadian/physiological instability: reduced interdaily stability (Z = −1.42), low amplitude (Z = −1.10), low 24‑h autocorrelation (Z = −0.68) — rhythm disruptions that in this sample associate with higher stress.  
- Strength of evidence: many of these indicators are both large in magnitude and based on measures with relatively strong correlations to PSS in the sample, producing coherent multimodal evidence for above‑mean perceived stress.  
- Protective factors noted (high self‑efficacy Z = +1.79; low resting HR Z ≈ −0.55) are present but are described as insufficient to fully offset the above signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study sample)
- Elevated physiological arousal and circadian disruption from wearables: high resting heart rate (75.5 bpm; Z = +2.06), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.81), low 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.16), and low cosinor amplitude (Z ≈ −1.85). These objective features correlate positively (though modestly) with PSS in this sample and are consistent with greater autonomic/circadian perturbation.  
- Aggregate pattern of nocturnal/evening heart‑rate elevations and blunted rhythm amplitude consistent with stress‑linked physiological profiles.  
- Caveat: the wearable markers’ correlations with PSS in this dataset are modest (e.g., resting HR r ≈ 0.15, intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), so although Z‑scores are notable, their predictive weight for PSS is lower than some psychological measures.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Strength and directness of indicators: Participant 1’s strongest indicators of higher stress include subjective symptom scales with large correlations to PSS (GAD‑7 r = 0.78, emotional lability r = 0.68) and an extreme, concordant objective sleep signal (very short median sleep and very high timing variability) that also correlates substantially with PSS (PSQI r = 0.50). These are direct, high‑weight predictors of perceived stress in that sample.  
- Participant 2’s indicators pointing toward higher stress are primarily wearable‑derived physiological/circadian features with notable Z‑scores but only modest correlations with PSS in that dataset. In contrast, Participant 2 reports low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, good sleep, good social engagement, and above‑average self‑esteem — self‑report domains that map directly onto perceived stress and that would predict below‑mean PSS. Therefore the objective signals for Participant 2 carry less inferential weight than Participant 1’s strong subjective and objective stress indicators.  
- Direction and coherence: Participant 1 shows multiple lines (subjective symptom severity, objective extreme sleep disruption, substance problems, circadian instability) that coherently point toward above‑mean PSS. Participant 2 shows a discordant profile (low subjective distress, but physiological signs of arousal) that leads to an overall inference of near‑mean PSS with a possible mild physiological lean toward higher stress.

Overall balance of evidence and conclusion
- Given the magnitude, coherence, and relatively strong correlations of Participant 1’s stress‑related indicators with PSS in their sample, Participant 1 is more likely to have a higher perceived stress level (above their population mean) than Participant 2 is relative to their own population mean (Participant 2 inferred near the mean, with physiological signs but low self‑reported distress).

- Some physiological/behavioral support consistent with higher stress:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (resting HR z = 1.31; MESOR z = 1.19).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Objective sleep/circadian disruption consistent with higher PSS:
  - Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and slightly short median sleep (6 h 45 m).
  - Late and irregular bedtimes (median start ~00:50; sleep-start variability z ≈ 0.86).
  - Low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.07), reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -0.78), low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.61) — objective markers associated in this sample with higher PSS (amplitude r ≈ -0.17).
  - Modestly elevated resting HR (61.9 bpm, z = 0.45; resting HR r ≈ 0.14).
- The description notes these objective markers push the inferred PSS slightly above the sample mean, but the overall conclusion is that perceived stress is near the population mean (population mean = 21.62), with only a modest tilt upward if objective signals are weighted.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Strength of predictors: Participant 1’s profile is dominated by several self-report measures that both (a) strongly predict PSS in that sample (high r values up to 0.77) and (b) are elevated or adverse for this individual (anxiety, emotional lability, poor sleep, low self-efficacy). Those strong, directly relevant self-report signals provide a robust within-sample reason to infer above-mean PSS.
- Participant 2 presents a split signal: psychological trait/mood self-reports are clearly favorable (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem; z ≈ -0.8 to -0.9), which in this dataset correlate with lower PSS, while wearable sleep/circadian metrics show moderate deviations in the direction associated with higher PSS. However, the objective markers in Participant 2 have weaker correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.17, resting HR r ≈ 0.14), and the summary explicitly rates this participant’s overall PSS as near the population mean (only a modest push above if objective signals weighted).
- Net evidence: Participant 1 shows multiple, strongly weighted, congruent self-report indicators of higher perceived stress (and some wearable support). Participant 2 has conflicting signals and the strongest signals (trait/mood self-reports) point toward lower PSS or near-mean PSS; their objective disturbances are weaker predictors of PSS in-sample.

Conclusion
- Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Synthesis note: the write-up explicitly concludes this participant is likely above the study mean PSS, and the strongest signals (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE) have relatively large correlations with PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Baselines: the two study population mean PSS values are very similar (21.62 vs 21.29), so comparisons hinge on each participant’s pattern relative to their own sample.
- Strength and number of stress-linked indicators:
  - Participant 1 shows mixed signals: psychological self-report (CES-D, STAI, high self‑esteem) are clearly below sample mean (z ≈ -0.8 to -0.9), which are strong protective indicators given their known links to perceived stress. The stress-congruent signals for P1 are mainly objective (sleep/circadian disruption and mildly elevated RHR), generally moderate in effect and some with modest correlations to PSS.
  - Participant 2 shows multiple robust, concordant indicators pointing toward higher PSS: subjective sleep and pain are substantially above mean and both have large correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.53); low self-efficacy is below mean and strongly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ -0.69). These are reinforced by elevated nocturnal HR and reduced interdaily stability. Although P2 has some mitigating features (low GAD-7, long sleep duration), the core high-stress signals are stronger and more numerous and are tied to higher sample-level PSS associations.
- Overall balance: Participant 2’s profile contains more and stronger predictors of elevated perceived stress (both subjective measures with high PSS correlations and convergent physiological markers). Participant 1’s strongest signals that point to higher stress are fewer, generally weaker, and are counterbalanced by strong protective self-report measures.

- Subjective sleep classified as “Disturbed” on PSQI (score = 6), which typically co-occurs with higher perceived stress (PSQI correlates with PSS in the sample).  
- Moderate night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start SD ≈ 103 min, duration SD ≈ 123 min; Zs ≈ 0.43–0.51), and a late median sleep start (~01:07), which can reflect schedule strain or circadian misalignment linked to stress.  
- Modestly low frequency of exercise/sport (1–2×/week) that can weakly associate with poorer stress resilience.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 8), and GAD‑7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this dataset (r = 0.77), making this one of the strongest predictors of higher PSS.  
- Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) with PSQI positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 0.63) that strongly correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.66).

- Pain/interference indicators that positively correlate with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).  
- Wearable physiology indicating tonic hyperarousal and circadian disruption: high resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.19–1.24), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ -1.05), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.07), low interdaily stability, and pronounced early‑morning HR elevations—patterns that align with higher perceived stress.  
- Objective sleep shows extremely short median nightly sleep (median ≈ 1 h 39 min, Z ≈ -1.27), very late sleep onset (~04:36 AM), and increased napping—consistent with severe sleep disruption and nocturnal hyperarousal that typically accompany higher PSS (though objective sleep figures may be affected by device non‑wear or artifact).

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Participant 1’s few vulnerability signals (mildly elevated trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, sleep timing variability, late sleep) are counterbalanced by multiple protective or stress‑reducing signals that are both behaviorally and physiologically meaningful in this sample: low depressive symptoms, above‑average self‑esteem/happiness, low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.67), high circadian amplitude (Z ≈ 0.50) and low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -0.95), objectively long nightly sleep (Z ≈ 1.14), high social time, and minimal substance use. The summary for P1 explicitly concludes perceived stress is near the study mean with a slight leaning toward protection — i.e., not clearly above‑average.  
- Participant 2 displays multiple, independent, and relatively strong indicators that map onto PSS in this dataset: subjective anxiety (highest correlation with PSS), severe subjective sleep disturbance, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy, pain interference, and concordant wearable markers of physiological hyperarousal and circadian blunting. Several of these measures have large correlations with PSS (r values ~0.66–0.77) and meaningful Z‑score deviations (e.g., resting HR/MESOR Z > 1, amplitude Z < -1, IV Z > 1). Even allowing for caveats about possible wearable artifacts in sleep duration, the convergent pattern across high‑correlation self‑report measures and physiological dysregulation points clearly to above‑mean perceived stress in their sample.

Balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed profile but overall consistent with near‑mean (not clearly elevated) PSS in their population.  
- Participant 2: multiple strong, convergent indicators—especially measures with high PSS correlations—indicate PSS above the population mean.

8,73158,20,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evident in the description)
- Self‑report measures strongly associated with PSS are elevated: GAD‑7 = 8 (mild anxiety) with very high correlation to PSS (r = 0.77); elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 0.63; r = 0.66); low self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; r = -0.65); disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13; r = 0.49). These are the strongest, most direct predictors of higher PSS in the dataset.
- Pain/interference scores (PEG‑3 and PAPAS) show moderate positive association with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48), adding to distress burden.
- Wearable physiology and circadian markers consistent with hyperarousal and dysregulation: elevated resting HR (76.35 bpm, Z = 1.19) and MESOR (Z = 1.24); reduced diurnal amplitude (Z = -1.05), higher intradaily variability (Z = 1.07), low interdaily stability — a blunted/fragmented rhythm pattern linked to stress.
- Pronounced early‑morning heart‑rate elevations (1–8 AM, several hours Z > 1) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41) — consistent with nocturnal/early‑morning hyperarousal.
- Objective sleep metrics indicate extremely short median nightly sleep (1 h 39 min, Z = -1.27) and very late sleep start (~04:36 AM), which—if valid—would strongly support elevated perceived stress.
- Holistic summary in the description explicitly concludes this participant is likely above their study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.08).

Mitigating points to note (from the description)
- Anxiety is in the mild range rather than moderate/severe; substance‑use subscale is low; some wearable‑to‑PSS correlations are weak or mixed. The unusually short wearable sleep could reflect device nonwear or artifact.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evident)
- Pronounced early‑morning heart‑rate spikes (5–7 AM Zs up to +4.41) that, in this sample, have small‑to‑moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.21–0.23); these could reflect situational arousal tied to higher perceived stress.
- Shorter median nocturnal sleep duration (6 h 11 min, Z = -1.25) relative to cohort; sleep‑start variability (SD = 67 min) is non‑negligible — both can be stress‑related vulnerabilities.
- The description explicitly cautions that morning peaks and reduced sleep time are features associated with higher PSS and warrant monitoring.

Reasons Participant 2 likely has lower PSS (dominant evidence)
- Very low depressive and trait‑anxiety self‑reports (CES‑D = 0, Z = -1.38; STAI‑Trait Z = -1.71) — strong signals of low perceived stress.
- High self‑esteem and momentary happiness (Rosenberg Z = +1.66; happiness Z = +1.64).
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26) and absence of substance use.
- Physiological markers consistent with low stress: low resting HR (48.2 bpm, Z = -1.18), low MESOR (Z = -1.10), and lower intradaily variability (Z = -0.74).
- Healthy lifestyle/social supports (frequent group exercise, good health satisfaction) that align with resilience.
- Holistic summary in the description explicitly concludes this participant is likely below their study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.62).

Comparative weighting (within each participant’s population frame)
- Participant 1’s description contains multiple strong, converging predictors of higher PSS, including self‑report measures with very high correlations to PSS (notably anxiety r = 0.77 and emotional lability r = 0.66), plus physiological and sleep signals consistent with hyperarousal and circadian disruption. These indicators are both numerous and highly correlated with PSS in that study, and the description explicitly judges this participant above the study mean.
- Participant 2’s description is dominated by strong protective signals (very low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem, low resting HR, good subjective sleep, healthy behaviors) that point to below‑mean perceived stress in that study. The adverse signals for Participant 2 (morning HR spikes, somewhat short sleep) are fewer, weaker in their PSS correlations (r ≈ 0.21–0.23), and framed as situational/monitoring concerns rather than primary evidence of high PSS.

Conclusion
Given the number, strength, and correlation of indicators pointing toward elevated perceived stress for Participant 1 (and the predominance of protective, low‑stress indicators for Participant 2), Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher PSS relative to their respective study populations.

- Marked early‑morning heart‑rate spikes (hourly Z ≈ +3.10 and +4.41) that, in the sample, show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.21–0.23). These spikes could reflect episodic arousal tied to stress.
- Shorter objective nocturnal sleep (median 6 h 11 min; Z ≈ −1.25) despite good subjective sleep quality — shorter sleep is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Some sleep timing variability (sleep‑start SD ≈ 67 min) and limited solitary stress‑reduction hobbies, which could modestly reduce resilience.
- Overall, these are relatively localized/moderate risk signals in an otherwise low‑stress profile; their sample correlations with PSS are modest.

- Each description is given relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1 is characterized as likely below their population mean PSS; Participant 2 is characterized as likely above their population mean PSS.
- Participant 1’s deviations that could increase PSS are limited in scope (morning HR peaks, somewhat short sleep) and have only small-to-moderate sample correlations with PSS. Most of P1’s high‑impact indicators (depression, trait anxiety, self‑esteem, subjective sleep quality, resting HR, exercise, no substance use) strongly point to below‑mean perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, concordant high‑impact risk factors (clinically disturbed subjective sleep, objectively very short/late sleep, elevated pain, nocturnal physiological arousal) that have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS. Although P2 has notable protective factors (low GAD‑7, high self‑efficacy, low emotional lability), those protections do not fully offset the magnitude and number of sleep/pain/arousal signals that are strongly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Net balance: Participant 2’s cluster of large, PSS‑relevant abnormalities provides stronger evidence of elevated perceived stress (relative to their cohort) than Participant 1’s limited and lower‑impact risk signals.

- Subjective sleep is disturbed (PSQI = 7; z ≈ +0.13), and poor sleep quality correlates with higher PSS in the sample.
- Some within-day behavioral fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ +0.10) and nontrivial night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 94 min) are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Late median sleep onset (~00:50) and several early‑morning hourly HR deviations (3–7am) that have small positive correlations with PSS in the cohort.
Note: these signals are small-to-moderate in magnitude (z’s near 0.1–0.5) and the summary explicitly concludes the overall profile is below the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; z = +0.67) and extremely short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min), both strong correlates of elevated perceived stress in this dataset.
- Very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = +0.89) and large variability in sleep onset (SD = 204 min; z ≈ +0.34); these indicate severely irregular sleep linked to higher PSS.
- Markedly elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = +2.34), a contextual risk factor likely to increase perceived stress despite weaker sample-level correlation with PSS.
- Dampened circadian amplitude, low interdaily stability and low 24 h autocorrelation—indicators of disrupted daily structure that commonly co-occur with higher stress.
Note: there are protective features (very low GAD-7, low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR), and the summary judges the participant as near the population mean with a modest tilt above it (population mean PSS = 21.29, SD = 7.42).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s negative indicators are modest (small positive z’s) and are outweighed by multiple stronger protective signals (trait anxiety and depression slightly below mean, high self‑esteem and happiness, low resting HR z ≈ -0.85, high 24‑h autocorrelation z ≈ +0.48, regular sports/social/academic functioning). Relative to their study mean (21.62, SD 3.68), the summary places them below the mean.
- Participant 2 exhibits several large, clinically and behaviorally meaningful stress-related signals (very poor and short sleep, very high sleep variability, interpersonal problems with z = +2.34, reduced circadian regularity). Although they show low current anxiety symptoms and some physiological signs consistent with lower tonic arousal, the magnitude of the sleep/circadian and interpersonal disturbances is substantial. Relative to their study mean (21.29, SD 7.42), the summary places them near the mean with a modest tilt toward above-mean stress.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- The preponderance of evidence indicates Participant 2 shows more and larger stress-related risk signals (severe sleep restriction/irregularity and marked interpersonal strain) relative to their population than Participant 1 does relative to theirs, where negative signals are comparatively mild and outweighed by protective factors.
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (higher PSS).

17,95559,19,20,"Possible reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean = 21.62)
- Several wearable-derived circadian/sleep metrics deviate from the sample norm in directions associated with higher PSS: very low interdaily stability (IS z = -1.98), low 24‑hr autocorrelation (z = -1.29), reduced circadian amplitude (z = -1.16). In the sample these metrics are negatively correlated with PSS, so such reductions modestly predict higher perceived stress.
- Late sleep timing (median sleep onset ≈ 02:10 AM) and elevated PSQI (7; “disturbed sleep”) are behaviorally linked with higher perceived stress in the cohort.
- Elevated mean daily nap frequency (z = 2.07) correlates positively with PSS in the sample and can reflect fragmented sleep or compensatory sleep behavior.
- Behavioral risk factors: relatively frequent alcohol use (beer ≥3×/week; z = 1.72) and low structured exercise (1–2×/week) are sometimes associated with higher stress/coping difficulties (though correlations with PSS here are small).

Possible reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean = 21.12)
- Strong, converging self-report indicators that are highly correlated with PSS in this sample: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; z = 1.25; GAD‑7–PSS r = 0.81) and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; z = 0.83; PSQI–PSS r = 0.51).
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62) is a strong inverse correlate of PSS in this cohort (r = -0.66).
- Pain and functional interference (PEG/PAPAS) at moderate levels; these measures correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.44–0.48).
- Physiological signs of arousal: elevated resting heart rate (79.8 bpm; z = 1.53) and elevated mesor (z = 1.49), consistent with sustained physiological stress.
- Wearable sleep shows very short median sleep duration (2 h 31 min), late and variable sleep start times—patterns concordant with elevated subjective sleep disturbance and thus higher PSS (even with caveat that wearables might undercount sleep).

Comparative, within-population weighting of evidence
- Strength and concordance of predictors: Participant 2 shows multiple high-weight indicators that, in this study, have strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 and NGSE). Those measures provide coherent, mutually reinforcing evidence for PSS above their sample mean.
- Participant 1 shows a mixed pattern: self-report affect measures (CES‑D, trait STAI, higher self‑esteem) are clearly below (protective) and are measures that correlate reasonably well with PSS, whereas objective circadian/sleep markers point toward modestly higher PSS but these markers have smaller correlations with PSS in the sample. The subjective indicators (which generally predict PSS more strongly) favor near/below-mean PSS for Participant 1.
- Measurement confidence: For Participant 2, subjective measures strongly support high stress and wearable measures (though with some caveats) largely align with that direction. For Participant 1, subjective measures and objective measures conflict; subjective (stronger PSS predictors) indicate lower stress while objective (weaker PSS predictors) indicate some dysregulation.

Conclusion (balance of evidence)
- Participant 2 has substantially stronger and more consistent evidence of perceived stress above their study mean than Participant 1 has of being above theirs. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

6,35361,20,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Strong self-report correlates of higher PSS:
  - Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) — in this sample GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.77).
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; disturbed) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.49).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 score; z = 0.93) — BASIS‑24 correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.67).
  - Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62) — NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.66).
  - Pain interference and PAPAS modestly positive with PSS (r ≈ 0.44 etc.).
- Wearable/behavior signs consistent with higher stress:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (HR = 77.6 bpm; z = 1.31 and MESOR z = 1.19).
  - Large night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep SD = 232 min; z = 1.12).
  - Late sleep onset (median 23:34) plus poor subjective sleep.
- Overall: multiple high‑correlation, self‑reported risk factors are present and the summary explicitly concludes the participant’s PSS is likely above their sample mean (21.08).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Physiological blip with a small positive association to PSS:
  - Large nocturnal HR troughs (−24.5 to −28.4 bpm around 3–5 AM). In this sample these troughs have small positive correlations with PSS (~0.14–0.21), so for this individual that signal raises a modest caution.
- Social/psychosocial caveats (but weakly related to PSS here):
  - Lower reported trust (z ≈ -1.1) and less socializing (z ≈ -0.62) — reduced social support can increase stress risk, but correlations with PSS are reported as very small in this dataset.
- Overall: these are minor/weak signals; the summary concludes the participant is likely below their sample mean PSS (21.62).

Comparative, within-frame reasoning and weighing evidence
- Both descriptions are given relative to their own study population means (P1 mean 21.08; P2 mean 21.62). Neither description provides raw PSS scores, so inference must be comparative within each study’s feature→PSS associations.
- Participant 1 shows multiple strong, directly relevant self‑report predictors of higher perceived stress (anxiety, poor PSQI, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy) with substantial sample correlations (some r’s ≈ 0.66–0.77). Wearable measures provide additional support (high resting HR, high sleep variability).
- Participant 2 shows many convergent indicators of lower perceived stress (low depressive and trait‑anxiety scores, high self‑esteem, good PSQI, low resting HR, high circadian stability). The few features that could point to higher stress (nocturnal HR troughs, low trust) have only small correlations with PSS and are outweighed by multiple consistent low‑stress signals.
- The predictive signals favoring higher PSS are stronger and more numerous for Participant 1 (and explicitly summarized as above‑mean), whereas Participant 2’s evidence predominantly indicates below‑mean PSS.

18,83748,18,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean PSS = 21.62)
- Subjective sleep difficulty (PSQI = 6, above common cutoff) suggesting disturbed sleep.
- Wearable circadian irregularity: reduced interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, slightly elevated intradaily variability — signals that can associate with stress.
- Pronounced evening and late‑night heart‑rate elevations (large Z-scores, e.g., midnight HR Z ≈ +3.5) that could reflect evening/night physiological arousal.
- Low socializing time (Z = −2.20), a behavioral vulnerability for stress.
Note: many of these signals either have small sample-level correlations with PSS (hourly HR correlations up to ~0.21) or are outweighed by strong protective self-report markers in this participant.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean PSS = 21.17)
- High anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 14.5, Z = 0.9) and emotional lability, both strongly positively associated with PSS in the sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.80; emotional lability r ≈ 0.66).
- Severe sleep disruption: very high PSQI (13), extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 m), very late and highly variable sleep onset — PSQI and sleep metrics have meaningful positive associations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.49).
- Marked physiological/arousal and rhythm disruption: high resting HR (81 bpm, Z = +1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = −1.57), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.23).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (midnight–2 AM) that show moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).
- Pain/interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Protective factors are limited (modestly higher self-efficacy only), and many of the risk features are both strong in magnitude and strongly correlated with PSS in this sample.

Comparative, within‑population-frame reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be at or slightly below their population mean (21.62) based largely on multiple strong protective self‑report indicators (low CES‑D and STAI‑T, high self‑esteem and momentary happiness, frequent exercise, low substance use). The wearable risk signals for P1 exist but are fewer and, where quantified, have smaller sample correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2 is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean (21.17). The evidence for elevated perceived stress is multidimensional (self‑report anxiety and sleep complaints, objective extremely short/irregular sleep, elevated resting HR, flattened rhythms, nocturnal HR elevations, pain) and includes measures with strong sample-level correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 and emotional lability, plus PSQI and pain).
- In terms of strength and consistency, Participant 2’s risk indicators are both more numerous and more strongly tied to PSS in their study sample than Participant 1’s wearable anomalies are to PSS in theirs. Participant 1’s dominant signal is resilient self‑report and behavior, which argues for lower perceived stress despite some physiological irregularities.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Very high depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 39; z = 2.67) — a large deviation from the sample and a known positive correlate of PSS.  
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI‑T = 60; z = 1.85), low positive affect (happy z = −1.61), and low self‑esteem (RSES z = −1.43) — multiple affective/self‑evaluation indicators that cohere with higher perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) despite adequate objective sleep — the subjective–objective discrepancy suggests nonrestorative or fragmented sleep and sleep‑related distress linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Low socializing and infrequent exercise plus low health satisfaction and trust — psychosocial/behavioral buffers are reduced, which can elevate perceived stress.  
- Although there are protective objective markers (long objective sleep, strong circadian HR measures, normal resting HR, daytime activation), these appear insufficient to outweigh the substantial psychological symptom burden.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9), which has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample.  
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 7.5) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24), both of which have very strong correlations with PSS in this dataset (GAD r ≈ 0.80, emotional lability r ≈ 0.67).  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG, PAPAS) with moderate correlations to PSS — additional stressors.  
- Some nocturnal HR deviations associated with higher PSS (late‑night HR departures), suggesting possible nocturnal arousal tied to stress.  
- Offsetting these are protective features (strong circadian amplitude and 24‑h autocorrelation, robust daytime HR peaks linked to lower PSS, very long objective sleep opportunity, low napping, and near‑average self‑efficacy), which the summary says likely moderate the impact of the self‑reported symptoms.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Magnitude of deviation: Participant 1 shows very large deviations on core affective measures within their population (CES‑D z = 2.67, STAI z = 1.85, happiness/self‑esteem substantially below mean). These are broad, large‑magnitude indicators of distress across mood, anxiety, and self‑view.  
- Predictive strength vs. severity: Participant 2’s self‑report predictors are strongly correlated with PSS in their study (high r values), but the absolute symptom levels described are more moderate (e.g., GAD‑7 = 7.5 = mild anxiety; PSQI = 9 and pain scores are notable but not extreme). Participant 2 also has pronounced objective physiological protections (strong circadian structure, consolidated daytime activation, long objective sleep) that the profile explicitly states moderate the elevation in perceived stress.  
- Breadth of burden: Participant 1’s profile combines high internalizing psychopathology, low positive resources (self‑esteem, happiness), subjective sleep disturbance, and low social/exercise buffers — a broader and deeper psychosocial burden. Participant 2’s burden is meaningful (sleep, anxiety, emotional lability, pain) but appears more moderated by robust objective rhythms and longer objective sleep opportunity.

Overall judgment
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population PSS means. Considering the size and breadth of Participant 1’s affective and psychosocial deviations (notably the very high CES‑D and elevated STAI plus low positive resources and low social/exercise buffering), versus Participant 2’s more moderate symptom levels tempered by strong objective physiological protection, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress relative to their cohort.

- Strong internalizing symptom burden: very high depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 39; z = 2.67) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI‑T z = 1.85). Both scales are positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Low positive affect and self‑esteem: momentary happiness markedly below mean (z = -1.61) and RSES z = -1.43; both modestly negatively correlated with PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, disturbed) despite adequate objective duration — subjective poor sleep quality often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Low socializing and infrequent exercise, plus low self‑rated health and low trust — psychosocial factors that remove buffers against stress.
- Several of these subjective/self‑report measures are explicitly noted as robust indicators of higher PSS in this sample.

Moderating/offsetting evidence for Participant 1
- Objective physiology shows several protective features: longer-than-average nocturnal sleep duration (median ≈ 8 h), consistent sleep timing, strong circadian HR organization (high interdaily stability, high autocorrelation24, larger amplitude) and normal resting HR — these features in this cohort are associated with lower PSS and partially counter the subjective signal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16; z = 1.16) and very high correlation of GAD‑7 with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.78), making this a strong predictor.
- Very short and late sleep objectively (median sleep ≈ 2 h 58 m, sleep onset ~02:23) with substantial night‑to‑night variability — extreme objective sleep loss is strongly consistent with elevated perceived stress.
- Marked nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive heart‑rate deviations during typical sleep hours that correlate with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.40).
- Flattened/irregular circadian metrics: reduced amplitude (z = -1.4), high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low interdaily stability and very low 24‑h autocorrelation — a convergent physiological pattern associated with chronic stress and disrupted sleep.
- Low self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55) and high emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z = 1.23), both strongly correlated with PSS in this sample.
- Several self‑report measures here have large correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7, NGSE, BASIS‑24) and those measures are elevated in this participant.

Moderating/offsetting evidence for Participant 2
- Some baseline cardiovascular indices are at or below mean (resting HR and MESOR slightly low), and some daytime hours show lower‑than‑mesor HR; these could modestly complicate inference about autonomic arousal but do not negate the nocturnal arousal and severe sleep loss.
- Flattened amplitude can sometimes reflect lifestyle rather than stress, though here it aligns with objective short/late sleep and nocturnal HR elevations.

Comparative (within‑population) reasoning
- Both profiles are interpreted relative to their own study means and both are assessed as above‑mean PSS in their respective descriptions.
- The evidence for Participant 1 rests largely on high depressive symptoms and trait anxiety plus subjective sleep complaints and psychosocial deficits, but is meaningfully tempered by several objective protective features (long, regular sleep and robust circadian HR rhythms).
- The evidence for Participant 2 is more convergent and more extreme: severe anxiety with very strong correlation to PSS in this dataset, extreme objective sleep deprivation (~3 hours), clear nocturnal physiological arousal that correlates with PSS, and marked circadian disruption. Multiple high‑correlation predictors of PSS are elevated (GAD‑7, low NGSE, emotional lability), and objective physiology corroborates subjective distress.
- Effect sizes of the P2 predictors (high r values cited) and the extremity of objective sleep disruption and nocturnal arousal provide stronger, more consistent evidence of elevated perceived stress than the mixed pattern for P1 (subjective risk vs. objective protections).

Conclusion
On balance, Participant 2 displays the worse overall perceived stress.

- Severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0), median nightly sleep 2 h 38 m (Z = −0.94), very late median sleep start (03:12) and very high night-to-night onset variability (SD = 281 min, Z = +1.3). Sleep disruption in this sample is moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart rate deviations (1–2 AM Z ≈ +1.17; 3–4 AM Z ≈ +1.59), and these overnight elevations show positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 10 (meets screening threshold). Anxiety had the strongest correlation with PSS in this study (r = 0.78), so even a modestly elevated anxiety score is an important driver toward higher perceived stress.
- Some pain-related functional interference (PAPAS Z = +0.19), which correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (low interdaily stability and autocorrelation, higher intradaily variability) consistent with patterns tied to elevated perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study-frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI Z = +1.35 (notable elevation); trait anxiety in this sample correlates positively with PSS and is described as one of the strongest self-report indicators of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate: RHR Z = +1.50, a physiological correlate of autonomic arousal associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian dysregulation: markedly low interdaily stability and blunted amplitude (both Z ≈ −1.7) and increased intradaily fragmentation—consistent with irregular schedules/physiological dysregulation linked to stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep and variability: PSQI Z = +0.59 and elevated night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = +1.25; sleep start SD Z = +0.86).
- Lower positive affect / self-esteem (Z ≈ −0.5 to −0.9), which can contribute to higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning (accounting for each description’s within-sample frame)
- Strength and breadth of stress signals: Participant 2 presents multiple moderately large deviations in measures strongly linked to stress (trait anxiety Z +1.35, RHR Z +1.50, circadian amplitude/stability Z ≈ −1.7). These are consistent, convergent signals across psychological and physiological axes.
- Participant 1’s strongest objective signal is extreme sleep disruption (very short median sleep, very late/variable timing) and nocturnal HR elevations; those are powerful stress-related signals. However, several highly weighted protective traits are present (self-efficacy Z = +0.3 and notably low emotional lability Z = −0.97), and the participant’s GAD-7 is only modestly above average (Z = +0.11), despite meeting the screening threshold. In other words, P1 has one very salient domain (sleep/overnight arousal) pushing toward high PSS but also strong resilience markers that attenuate the overall inference.
- In contrast, Participant 2 shows moderately-to-strong elevations across several domains that each independently relate to PSS (trait anxiety, resting HR, blunted circadian amplitude/stability, subjective sleep disturbance) with fewer pronounced protective buffers. Participant 2’s near-seven-hour median sleep duration is a mitigating factor, but many other measures point consistently upward.
- Relative magnitudes: Although Participant 1’s sleep duration is extreme in absolute terms, the provided Z-scores for P1 are a mix of moderate positives and important negatives (protective). Participant 2’s profile has several Z-scores clustered above |1.3–1.7|, indicating a broader pattern of deviation associated with higher PSS in that study population.

Overall judgement
- Taking the balance of convergent psychological and physiological indicators (particularly the higher trait-anxiety and elevated resting heart rate plus pronounced circadian amplitude/stability reductions) and the relative lack of equally strong protective traits, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress) relative to their study population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs.

- Elevated anxiety and emotional dysregulation: GAD-7 = 10.5 (meets screening threshold) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = +0.53. These survey signals are strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (GAD-7 ↔ PSS r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.65), making them potent predictors of above-mean PSS.  
- Poor subjective sleep and pain interference: PSQI = 8.5 (disturbed sleep) and PEG-3 / PAPAS elevated (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z = +1.21). Both sleep disturbance and pain correlate moderately with PSS in this dataset (PSQI r ≈ 0.55; PAPAS r ≈ 0.47), supporting higher perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large nighttime HR deviations (≈ +14 bpm, Z ≈ +1.3 at midnight–2am), which in this sample correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), are consistent with active physiological stress/arousal.  
- Night-to-night sleep variability/fragmentation: High SD of nightly sleep (199 min, Z ≈ +0.65) can exacerbate subjective stress even if median sleep is long.

Reasons Participant 1 might NOT have high PSS (protective/mitigating)
- Psychophysiological resilience indicators: above-average self-efficacy (Z ≈ +0.12) and strong circadian regularity/amplitude (IS Z ≈ +0.58; 24-h autocorrelation Z ≈ +0.97; amplitude Z ≈ +0.64) — measures that correlate negatively with PSS in the sample and likely buffer stress.  
- Low resting heart rate (55.7 bpm, Z ≈ −0.86) and low substance-use problems (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z ≈ −0.77) point to lower tonic physiological arousal and less behavioral risk.

Net within-sample judgment for Participant 1: multiple strong self-report predictors (notably anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability) and corroborating nocturnal HR elevations support an inference of PSS above the study mean, but substantial protective physiological/circadian signals temper the magnitude of elevation.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- High trait anxiety: STAI = 55 (Z ≈ +1.35) and STAI positively correlates with PSS — a strong psychosocial predictor of above-mean perceived stress.  
- Broad physiological dysregulation: elevated resting HR (70.8 bpm, Z ≈ +1.50) indicating greater tonic autonomic arousal, plus markedly blunted circadian measures (interdaily stability Z ≈ −1.73; amplitude Z ≈ −1.76) and increased intradaily fragmentation — a pattern commonly linked to higher stress.  
- Disturbed and irregular sleep timing: PSQI = 8 (Z ≈ +0.59), very late median sleep start (~01:03) and high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z ≈ +1.25; sleep start SD Z ≈ +0.86), which are associated with higher PSS.  
- Lower positive psychosocial indicators: reduced happiness and self-esteem (Z ≈ −0.53 and −0.87) that add psychosocial weight toward elevated perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might NOT have high PSS (mitigating)
- Low–moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, Z ≈ −0.34) — argues against very high global symptom burden.  
- Near-seven-hour median sleep duration, minimal napping, limited substance use, and some social/exercise and leisure (music) behaviors that could be coping supports.

Net within-sample judgment for Participant 2: several converging and relatively large deviations across psychological (trait anxiety), physiological (resting HR), and circadian rhythm measures (large negative Zs for IS and amplitude) point to PSS above the study mean and suggest a broader, multi-domain dysregulation consistent with elevated perceived stress.

Comparative weighing (within each participant’s population context)
- Strength and correlation of predictors: Participant 1 has very strong self-report predictors (GAD-7 with a high sample correlation to PSS r ≈ 0.77) plus nocturnal HR spikes. However, many of Participant 1’s physiological and circadian metrics are protective (positive Zs for IS, autocorrelation, amplitude; low resting HR), creating a mixed profile with strong risk in some domains but clear resilience in others.  
- Breadth and magnitude of dysregulation: Participant 2 shows large-magnitude deviations across multiple domains (psychological trait anxiety Z ≈ +1.35; resting HR Z ≈ +1.50; interdaily stability and amplitude Zs ≈ −1.7 each; sleep timing variability Zs > +1), indicating more pervasive dysregulation with fewer substantial physiological/circadian protective signals. Several of these deviations (especially the circadian amplitude/IS and resting HR) are large in Z-score magnitude within that sample.  
- Overall pattern: Participant 1’s above-mean signals appear concentrated in affective/sleep/pain domains but are partially counterbalanced by robust circadian structure and low tonic HR. Participant 2’s profile shows elevated anxiety plus systemic circadian and autonomic dysregulation with fewer buffering signs, suggesting a higher overall burden consistent with higher perceived stress relative to that study’s mean.

Conclusion
Both participants are characterized as above their respective population means for PSS in their summaries. Considering the balance of domain breadth, magnitude of deviations, and presence/absence of protective features within each participant’s sample frame, Participant 2’s profile is likely the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

- Pain and activity interference: PEG‑3 ≈ 6.78 and PAPAS z ≈ 0.24; both measures correlate moderately with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48), adding additional stress‑related burden.  
- Circadian irregularity and interpersonal strain: low interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.68), low autocorrelation at 24 h (z ≈ -0.35), and interpersonal problems (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z ≈ 0.54) all trend with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Trait anxiety and related affective signals: STAI = 47 (z ≈ 0.56) and lower happiness/self‑esteem (Zs ≈ -0.53 and -0.59) — all positively associated with PSS in this cohort (STAI–PSS corr ≈ 0.31; CES‑D/affect correlations ≈ 0.28–0.19).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance and delayed/variable timing: PSQI = 6 (disturbed), late median sleep start (~01:11) and elevated sleep‑start SD (≈101 min, z ≈ 0.4) — modest positive associations with PSS.  
- Marked circadian instability by some wearable metrics: interdaily stability z ≈ -1.48 (substantial magnitude), elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.39), and modestly higher resting HR (z ≈ 0.39); these physiological/circadian features are linked to higher PSS in the study.  
- Behavioral indicators that may reflect coping/stress: frequent solitary exercise (z ≈ 1.07) and moderate alcohol use (z ≈ 1.0) — small correlations but in directions not protective for PSS in this sample.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means: Participant 1 is judged “slightly above” the PSS mean (21.04); Participant 2 is judged “modestly above” the PSS mean (21.61). Those verbal labels alone do not prove which absolute PSS is larger, so we must weigh the strength and number of convergent predictors within each description.  
- Strength of predictors: Participant 1’s profile includes variables that have relatively large correlations with PSS in that sample (notably the GAD–PSS r = 0.78 and PSQI r = 0.49) plus a large objective sleep‑variability effect (z ≈ 1.7). Those strong predictors point toward a meaningful upward deviation from the population mean even if the summary called it only “slightly” above.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple consistent, moderate‑sized risk signals (trait anxiety, circadian fragmentation with interdaily stability z ≈ -1.48, subjective sleep disturbance), but many of these predictors have smaller correlations with PSS in that cohort (e.g., STAI–PSS ≈ 0.31; sleep timing correlations ≈ 0.17). Several clear protective/neutral features (regular exercise, good academic functioning, limited drug use, socializing) are also present for Participant 2.  
- Net balance: Participant 1’s combination of a very high subjective sleep score, extreme sleep‑timing variability, pain interference, and a very strong anxiety–PSS linkage gives a denser cluster of relatively high‑weight risk signals. Participant 2 has several moderate‑weight risk signals but also stronger behavioral buffers. Overall, the evidence for greater perceived stress is somewhat stronger for Participant 1 when one accounts for the relative predictive strength of the features described.

23,29134,17,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 1’s study mean = 21.62)
- Strong sleep signals linked to higher PSS: PSQI = 11 (z ≈ +1.98) and very irregular sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 183 min; z ≈ +2.20). Sleep duration variability elevated (z ≈ +1.33). These are the clearest risk indicators in this profile and are described as the primary driver toward higher perceived stress.
- Some physiological circadian markers modestly concordant with higher PSS: blunted HR amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -0.51) and small early-morning HR deviations associated with PSS in the sample.
- Net conclusion in the description: overall inferred PSS is near the sample mean but with a modest tilt upward primarily due to sleep problems.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.21)
- Marked sleep-related risk signals: PSQI ≈ 10.5 (clinically elevated; r ≈ 0.48 with PSS), median objective sleep ≈ 4 h 21 min (severely short sleep opportunity), and sleep timing variability (SD ≈ 123 min). These patterns are classically associated with higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive overnight HR deviations around midnight–2 AM (+11.96 and +14.62 bpm; z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- However, the profile’s integrated inference (in its own frame) was that despite these sleep/overnight arousal risks, the participant’s overall PSS is likely below the sample mean because of very strong protective daytime/trait signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame and weighing evidence
- Direction and magnitude of predictors: Participant 1’s strongest stress-related signals are sleep disturbance and extreme sleep-timing irregularity (z ≈ +2). These are large effects relative to that study’s distribution and push inferred PSS slightly above that study’s mean. But many protective signals (low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms only modestly below mean; strong exercise engagement and positive affect z-scores) partially offset the sleep signal; net inference was “near mean, maybe slightly above.”
- Participant 2 also has strong sleep pathology (PSQI elevated, objectively very short sleep, nocturnal HR arousal). Those are severe objectively (median sleep ~4.4 hours), which would plausibly increase PSS. However, Participant 2’s daytime/trait predictors that are highly and tightly correlated with PSS (very low GAD-7, high general self-efficacy) are large, well-correlated protective signals in that study (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). Additionally, circadian regularity metrics are strongly positive (interdaily stability and 24h autocorr z ≈ +1.8–2.0), another substantial protective factor.
- The study descriptions explicitly infer Participant 1’s PSS as approximately at or slightly above their study mean (21.62), whereas Participant 2’s integrated inference was that their PSS is likely below their study mean (21.21), despite marked sleep problems. In other words: P1 ≈ mean → slightly above; P2 ≈ below mean.
- When comparing the two within their respective frames, Participant 1’s balance of evidence tilts modestly toward higher perceived stress (sleep-driven) while Participant 2’s balance tilts toward lower perceived stress because very strong, highly predictive daytime/trait protections outweigh sleep risks in that study’s predictive structure.

Overall determination
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (more elevated PSS relative to their population mean) than Participant 2 does relative to theirs.

25,47810,21,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evident in the description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05) — above-cohort average poor sleep, a robust correlate of higher PSS.  
- Short nocturnal sleep: median ~6 h 40 min (z ≈ −0.65) — objectively shorter sleep than cohort, linked to higher stress.  
- Marked intraday circadian fragmentation: intradaily variability IV = 0.83 (z ≈ +2.01) — a very large positive deviation indicating frequent within-day rest–activity transitions associated with stress.  
- Elevated compensatory napping: mean daily naps z ≈ +2.34 — large effect consistent with daytime compensation for poor nocturnal sleep and higher fatigue/stress.  
- Evening physiological arousal/delayed timing: evening HR deviations positive, late acrophase — consistent with stress-related evening activation/rumination that can impair recovery.  
- Lower current happiness and health satisfaction (z ≈ −0.53 and −0.7) and a small elevation in depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ +0.18) — affective indicators that cohere with higher PSS.  
- Integrated inference in the description: explicitly characterized as “above the population mean” (mild-to-moderate elevation).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evident in the description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (classified as disturbed) — strongly associated with higher PSS (PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.49).  
- Anxiety: GAD‑7 = 6 (mild), and GAD‑7 has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.78), making even mild anxiety a salient contributor.  
- Pain interference and activity impact: PEG‑3 ~6.78 and PAPAS z ≈ +0.24 — both correlate positively with PSS and represent real functional burden.  
- Circadian/sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.68), very high night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD z ≈ +1.7) — objective markers linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal z ≈ +0.54 — above-average interpersonal difficulty can increase perceived stress.  
- Integrated inference in the description: characterized as “at or modestly above the study population mean,” with greatest likelihood slightly above the mean.

Comparative, within‑study-frame reasoning
- Both profiles are interpreted by their authors as above their respective study means, but the degree differs: Participant 1 is described as mild-to-moderately above the mean, whereas Participant 2 is described as only slightly/modestly above the mean.  
- Magnitude of objective deviations favors Participant 1: several very large positive z‑scores (intradaily variability ≈ +2.01; nap rate ≈ +2.34) indicate strong circadian/sleep disruption relative to that cohort. These objectively large deviations are called out as “most striking” in the synthesis and are strongly linked to higher PSS in the Participant 1 summary.  
- Participant 2 has several important stress-related signals (disturbed PSQI, high sleep variability z ≈ +1.7, mild anxiety with a high PSS correlation), but also has substantial protective factors with strong predictive power in that cohort (notably higher self‑efficacy r ≈ −0.65 and absence of substance problems z ≈ −1.62). The narrative explicitly rates Participant 2 as only slightly above the mean.  
- Correlational strength: Participant 2’s GAD‑7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in that sample (r = 0.78), which raises weight for anxiety-related stress; however the reported GAD score is only mild (6), and several large, objective markers in Participant 1 (IV and naps) are extreme relative to their cohort and were emphasized as particularly salient predictors of elevated perceived stress.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Participant 1 shows multiple, large-magnitude objective and subjective indicators of disturbed sleep/circadian function (very high IV and nap rate, shorter nocturnal sleep, poor PSQI) that the summary emphasizes as the most striking contributors to elevated PSS and explicitly concludes a mild-to-moderate elevation above the cohort mean.  
- Participant 2 shows meaningful stress-related signals (disturbed PSQI, high sleep variability, mild anxiety strongly correlated with PSS) but also notable protective factors and an overall characterization of being only slightly above the cohort mean.

18,79341,18,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Trait anxiety: STAI = 41 and STAI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31). Even though the Z-score is small, the presence of anxiety raises risk for higher perceived stress.
- Low momentary positive affect: very low self-rated “Happy” (Z ≈ -1.61), with a negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ -0.20) — low positive affect often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Shorter-than-average sleep and late timing: median wearable sleep < 7 h (Z ≈ -0.51) and typical sleep onset ≈ 01:50 — later/shorter sleep can impair coping and contribute to perceived stress.
- Slightly increased intradaily HR/activity variability (Z ≈ 0.32), which correlates positively (r ≈ 0.16) with PSS.
- Time-use patterns (high video-game time Z = 1.71, limited reading) that could reflect stress-related coping or reduced restorative activities.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- High anxiety symptom burden: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z ≈ 0.9) and very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.80) — one of the strongest single predictors in the description.
- Elevated emotional lability: BASIS-24 score elevated and strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Marked sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep, r ≈ 0.49 with PSS), extremely short median wearable sleep (2 h 19 m, Z ≈ -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (start SD Z ≈ 1.16) — objective and subjective sleep signals both point strongly toward stress-linked sleep disruption.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations (+8–9 bpm around midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).
- Dysregulated circadian/ activity rhythms: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.23), flattened circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.57) — these all align with higher stress in the sample.
- Elevated resting HR: 81.23 bpm (Z ≈ 1.67), consistent with greater physiological arousal and stress in this participant.
- Pain/functional interference: PEG-3 and related burden measures correlate with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.47) and are elevated.

Relative-frame reasoning (each description is referenced to its own study mean)
- Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes their profile is mixed but overall “near to modestly below” their population mean PSS (mean = 21.63). Their strongest deviations are protective (high interdaily stability, high 24-h autocorrelation, low resting HR) and the risk signals (modest anxiety, low momentary happiness, late/short sleep) are generally weaker or modest in size and correlation with PSS.
- Participant 2’s summary explicitly concludes their profile is consistent with perceived stress “above” their population mean (mean = 21.17). Multiple signals are both large in magnitude (e.g., RHR Z=1.67, amplitude Z=-1.57, extreme short sleep) and strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 r = 0.80, BASIS-24 r = 0.66), producing convergent evidence for elevated perceived stress.

Weighing the evidence across participants
- Strength and convergence: Participant 2 shows multiple, converging indicators (self-report anxiety strongly tied to PSS, severe sleep disturbance both subjective and objective, nocturnal HR arousal, circadian fragmentation, elevated RHR and pain interference) with several strong sample-level correlations to PSS. These are coherent and pronounced deviations from their sample mean.
- Participant 1 shows a mix of mild risk signals (anxiety, low momentary happiness, late sleep) but also several clear protective physiological/circadian markers (strong interdaily stability, low RHR, good objective sleep HR dips). Deviations are smaller and less consistently correlated with PSS.
- Because each description is interpreted relative to its own sample mean, the fact that Participant 2 is explicitly inferred to be above their (slightly lower) population mean while Participant 1 is inferred to be at or slightly below their (slightly higher) population mean further strengthens the conclusion that Participant 2 likely has the higher absolute perceived stress relative to their cohort.

3,79341,13,15,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1's study mean = 21.63)
- Trait anxiety (STAI = 41) is in an anxious range and correlates positively with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.31), which increases likelihood of elevated perceived stress.
- Very low momentary positive affect (self-rated “Happy” Z ≈ -1.61) is associated with greater subjective distress (PSS correlation ≈ -0.20).
- Late sleep timing and slightly reduced sleep duration (median ≈ 6 h 46 m) can impair coping and are modestly linked to higher PSS.
- Small signs of daily fragmentation (slightly elevated intradaily variability of HR) and some time-use (high video-game time) that could be stress-related coping.

Reasons Participant 1 might have a lower PSS (relative to their mean)
- Strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24h autocorrelation Z ≈ 0.9–0.98), which correlates negatively with PSS and is protective.
- Low resting heart rate (Z ≈ -1.18) and pronounced nocturnal HR dipping, suggesting lower physiological arousal.
- Good exercise habits and minimal substance use, and generally low depressive symptoms/self-esteem favorable — all pointing toward lower perceived stress.
- Integrated interpretation in the description: overall slightly favorable profile, inferred near-to-modestly-below the study mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2's study mean = 21.38)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), which has a fairly strong positive correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.47); this is a substantial risk factor.
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS) and interpersonal strain are present and correlate positively with PSS in the sample, contributing to stress burden.
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z ≈ +1.16, +1.22) indicating higher basal physiological arousal that can accompany stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (relative to their mean)
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41), and NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ -0.63) — a powerful protective factor.
- Very strong circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ +2.13, low intradaily variability Z ≈ -1.05) and emotional stability (low emotional lability) that are protective.
- Low substance-use problems and long objective sleep duration, which may mitigate stress despite poor subjective sleep.
- Integrated interpretation in the description: overall near the sample mean, likely at or slightly below mean because protective factors outweigh risk factors.

Comparative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Both participants are interpreted in their respective reports as near or slightly below their study means. Neither is described as clearly above their population mean.
- Participant 1’s strongest protective evidence is objective physiology and circadian regularity (low RHR, high interdaily stability), while their principal risks are subjective (trait anxiety, low momentary happiness) and later/shorter sleep.
- Participant 2 has a mix of strong protective resources (very high self-efficacy, very strong circadian regularity, emotional stability) but also notable and potentially potent risk factors (clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance, pain/interference, interpersonal strain) and elevated resting HR/mesor.
- The PSQI effect in Participant 2 is notable because subjective sleep disturbance in that sample correlates moderately strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), and the participant’s PSQI is strongly elevated (10.5). Participant 2 also shows multiple concurrent psychosocial stressors (pain, interpersonal issues) that are plausibly additive.
- Participant 1’s risk signals are milder and more limited in scope (mostly lower positive affect and some trait anxiety) and are counterbalanced by strong objective physiological resilience (low RHR) and routine/exercise habits.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- While both profiles are inferred as near or slightly below their respective study means, Participant 2 presents multiple substantive risk indicators (high PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain) alongside physiological signs of higher basal arousal. Those risk signals are stronger in magnitude and more numerous than Participant 1’s subjective risks.
- Participant 1’s objective physiological and circadian protections are comparatively robust and the subjective risk signals are weaker overall.
- Therefore, relative to their own populations, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

20,59673,21,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; classified as disturbed sleep; Z ≈ +0.59) — sleep problems are linked to higher PSS in the sample.
- Late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start 01:21; high night-to-night variability in duration and timing) and increased napping (Z ≈ +1.27) — circadian/sleep irregularity correlates positively with PSS.
- Wearable circadian metrics suggesting less stable rhythmicity (elevated intradaily variability, reduced 24-hour autocorrelation) — these metrics modestly correlate with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Evening/late-night elevations in heart-rate deviation (several hourly Zs up to ≈1.7) consistent with late-night arousal/hyperarousal, which can accompany higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a major predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) with a substantial correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) that correlate moderately-to-strongly with PSS (≈0.45–0.49).
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9) with a strong positive correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Wearable/circadian signs of blunted amplitude and low interdaily stability and very short median sleep duration (~3h55m) — these objective markers modestly associate with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Both participants’ population mean PSS scores are similar (21.61 vs. 21.04), so comparisons are directly meaningful.
- Participant 1 shows a mixed profile but the strongest and most consistent signals are protective: low depressive symptoms, below-average trait anxiety, high self-esteem (strong negative correlate with PSS), higher happiness and strong academic functioning. Their higher-stress signals are largely sleep/circadian-related and, in this cohort, these objective sleep/circadian metrics have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2 also shows a mixed profile but the high-stress signals are numerous and individually strong predictors of PSS in that cohort (notably GAD-7, PSQI, pain measures, and emotional lability with moderate-to-large correlations). Protective factors (high self-efficacy, lower interpersonal problems, lower resting HR) attenuate risk but do not outweigh multiple robust risk indicators.
- The magnitude and number of measures that strongly predict higher PSS are greater for Participant 2 than for Participant 1. Participant 1’s risk signals are mainly circadian/sleep irregularities with smaller effect sizes and are counterbalanced by multiple robust protective trait measures; Participant 2 has multiple strong self-report risk markers that, in this sample, are tightly linked to higher PSS.

Decision:
Based on the balance of evidence (strength, number, and correlation magnitudes of risk indicators), Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Symptom-level anxiety at the screening threshold (GAD-7 = 10). Anxiety measures have a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78), so even a moderate anxiety score is relevant.
- Some pain-related functional interference (PAPAS Z ≈ +0.19) and circadian irregularity (interdaily stability/autocorrelation Z ≈ -0.68 to -0.94; intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.92) that are typically associated with higher stress.

- Maintained academic functioning (multiple semesters with GPA > 3.2) and regular exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), which are modest protective factors.
- Resting HR and MESOR near the sample mean (no evidence of chronic tachycardia).

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame):
- Participant 1: strongest objective signals for higher stress are pronounced sleep disruption and nocturnal physiological arousal; however, key psychological symptom z-scores are modest (GAD-7 Z ≈ +0.11) and there are notable protective traits (self-efficacy, low emotional lability). Many adverse features are moderate in magnitude (Z ~ ±1).
- Participant 2: shows multiple very large deviations from the study mean (CES-D Z ≈ +3.7, STAI Z ≈ +2.2, sleep timing variability Z ≈ +2.65, substance-use very large z’s) plus convergent circadian disruption and low social/happiness indices. Although correlations between some measures and PSS are modest, the magnitude and multiplicity of high-risk indicators in Participant 2 are greater than those in Participant 1.

Conclusion: Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z ≈ +0.53 and strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.65), indicating mood instability likely increases perceived stress.
- Elevated baseline and nocturnal cardiovascular arousal: high resting HR/mesor (z ≈ +1.2–1.4) and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (1–4 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).

Comparative framing (within each study population)
- Participant 1’s description explicitly places them near their population mean PSS (population mean = 20.96), with mixed signals: some moderate-to-strong domain-specific risk signals (sleep disturbance, emotional lability, nocturnal HR) but several protective factors (low pain, good interpersonal functioning, mild anxiety).
- Participant 2’s description explicitly places them above their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61), driven by very large self-report symptom z-scores (depression, anxiety), pronounced sleep/timing irregularity, substance use, and low well-being—multiple, large-magnitude indicators that align with higher PSS in that sample.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Magnitude and consistency: Participant 2 shows multiple very large, consistent self-report signals (CES-D, STAI, PSQI, substance use, low happiness/trust) that are known and, in this dataset, positively associated with PSS. These signals are large in z-score and coherent across domains.
- Participant 1 shows some domain-specific risk (notably nocturnal physiological arousal and emotional lability), but these are more moderate in magnitude and are counterbalanced by several protective factors. Many wearable/circadian metrics for Participant 1 have weak correlations with PSS in their sample, and the overall inference was “near mean.”
- Relative differences in inferred status: P1 ≈ mean; P2 > mean (and likely meaningfully elevated given very high symptom z-scores).

- Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Subjective low well‑being: low happiness and trust (z ≈ -1.6 to -2.1) and below-average health satisfaction, consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Sleep/circadian disturbance consistent with stress: PSQI >5 (clinical threshold), very late median sleep onset (02:38), high night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing/duration (sleep SD z ≈ +1.2; sleep start SD z ≈ +0.9), reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.82) and flattened amplitude — irregular schedules that commonly accompany elevated perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological activation: elevated heart‑rate deviations in late evening/early night (positive deviations with z’s up to ≈ +2.25), suggesting arousal at typical wind‑down hours.
- Behavioral markers of dysregulation: increased daytime napping (mean daily naps z = +2.27) which can reflect compensatory sleep after stress-related poor nighttime sleep.

- High pain and interference: PEG‑3 and PAPAS both substantially elevated (z ≈ +1.4–1.6), which reduces coping capacity and is associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).
- Low general self‑efficacy: NGSE z ≈ -1.73, a strong negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61) indicating reduced coping confidence.
- Pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive hourly HR deviations during late night (e.g., 12–1 AM z ≈ +2.83; 2–3 AM z ≈ +2.14), aligning with hyperarousal and linking strongly to PSS for some windows.
- Multiple high‑weight, coherent signals (severe anxiety + sleep deprivation + pain + low efficacy + nocturnal HR arousal) converge to a strong above‑mean PSS inference.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have as high PSS (protective factors)
- Relatively preserved circadian regularity and higher amplitude (interdaily stability z ≈ +0.58; amplitude z ≈ +0.91) and low intradaily fragmentation (z ≈ -0.52), which modestly correlate with lower PSS and may provide resilience.
- Resting heart rate near cohort mean and lower substance use signal, which do not amplify stress.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Both summaries conclude each participant is likely above their cohort mean PSS. However, the strength, coherence, and predictive power of the elevated measures differ.
- Participant 2’s top stress indicators (severe GAD‑7, very short sleep, high pain interference, low self‑efficacy) include measures with larger effect sizes and much stronger correlations with PSS in that sample (notably anxiety r ≈ 0.75 and self‑efficacy r ≈ -0.61). Participant 2 also shows larger nocturnal HR deviations (z up to ≈ +2.83) and objectively very short sleep, both strong signals of hyperarousal and high perceived stress.
- Participant 1 has elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (>1 SD) and corroborating circadian/sleep irregularity, but those measures have more moderate associations with PSS in that study (r ≈ 0.28–0.31) and are substantially counterbalanced by robust protective features (long objective sleep, low RHR, regular exercise, high social/leisure engagement, strong academic performance).
- Although Participant 1’s population mean PSS (21.6) is slightly higher than Participant 2’s (20.62), what matters is the relative strength of predictors within each cohort. The convergent, high‑weight symptom set and stronger predictor correlations for Participant 2 indicate a larger deviation toward higher perceived stress relative to their cohort mean than Participant 1’s deviation relative to theirs.

Weighing the balance of evidence: Participant 2 shows a stronger, more coherent, and more predictive signal of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1 (despite both being judged above their respective sample means).

16,19245,23,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s sample frame)
- Marked affective symptom elevations: CES‑D = 26 and STAI = 55 are both >1 SD above their study mean (z ≈ +1.3). These measures typically covary with higher PSS.
- Low positive affect and social trust: happiness z = -1.61 and trust z = -2.07, consistent with greater perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI > 5 (PSQI = 7) and very late median sleep onset (02:38) with large night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.2) — patterns commonly associated with higher stress.
- Circadian/rhythm disruption: reduced interdaily stability (z = -0.82) and flattened amplitude — signals of irregular daily structure linked to higher PSS.
- Nocturnal/late‑evening physiological arousal: elevated heart‑rate deviations in late evening/early night (z’s up to +2.25), consistent with nocturnal arousal that tracks with stress.
- Study interpretation explicitly rates this profile as likely above the sample mean PSS.

Protective/mitigating features to note (but they do not fully counterbalance the above): long objective sleep duration (median ≈ 8 h, z = +1.14), low resting HR/mesor (z ≈ -1.0), regular exercise and high social/leisure activity, strong academic functioning.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Strong domain‑specific signals tied to PSS: emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability z = +0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Notable nocturnal physiological arousal: very large hourly nocturnal HR elevations (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM) and elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = +1.37; mesor z = +1.18); these nocturnal HR deviations correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI raw = 12 (clinically disturbed sleep) despite a sample‑relative z that is modest; also extreme sleep duration (median 12 h, z = +2.26) and very large night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD z = +2.38), which can reflect dysregulation associated with stress in other contexts.

Protective/mitigating features (substantial): low pain burden and interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS z’s ≈ -1.2 to -1.4), relatively intact interpersonal functioning (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = -1.77), only mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6; z ≈ -0.59). Several circadian metrics have weak correlations with PSS in this sample, limiting how strongly they inform PSS inference.

Comparative, within‑frame weighing of evidence
- Clarity and magnitude of affective risk signals: Participant 1 shows two high‑impact affective measures both >1 SD above their sample mean (CES‑D, STAI). Participant 2’s strongest affective signal is emotional lability (z ≈ +0.53), smaller in standardized magnitude than Participant 1’s elevations.
- Physiological arousal: Participant 2 shows higher baseline HR (z ≈ +1.37) and very large nocturnal HR elevations; these are strong physiological indicators of arousal. Participant 1 shows lower resting HR but late‑evening heart‑rate deviations (z up to +2.25) that indicate nocturnal/late‑evening activation. Both show physiologic signs linked to stress, but Participant 2’s elevated mesor/resting HR suggests a higher baseline cardiovascular tone compared to peers.
- Sleep and circadian disruption: Both participants display sleep/circadian irregularities tied to stress (P1: very late and variable sleep timing, PSQI >5; P2: very long and highly variable sleep duration, PSQI raw = 12). P1’s disturbances are paired with affective elevations >1 SD; P2’s sleep/circadian signals are strong but counterbalanced by several protective domains.
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s multiple, moderately strong affective elevations (>1 SD) plus corroborating sleep/circadian irregularity form a coherent multivariate pattern that the study summary judged likely above that sample’s mean PSS. Participant 2 has some strong physiological/nocturnal signals and emotional lability, but also several robust protective features (low pain, good interpersonal functioning, only mild generalized anxiety) and the study summary judged their PSS near the sample mean.

Final determination
- Taking the within‑sample frames and the weight/magnitude of affective, sleep, and physiological indicators together, Participant 1 is the stronger candidate for exhibiting the higher overall perceived stress (i.e., higher PSS relative to their study mean) than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Large affective symptom elevations: CES‑D = 37 (Z = 2.47) and STAI = 62 (Z = 2.05). These are substantial deviations from the cohort and are known to correlate positively with PSS in the sample.  
- Low positive affect and self‑concept: low happiness (Z = −1.61) and below‑average self‑esteem (Z = −1.29) further align with higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated tonic physiology: resting HR (Z = 1.34) and mesor (Z = 1.49) indicate higher basal cardiovascular activation, which in this dataset has modest positive associations with PSS.  
- Subjective sleep problems despite long objective sleep (PSQI > 5, Z ≈ 0.59) and late sleep timing, suggesting poor restorative sleep and possible evening arousal linked to stress.  
- While some behavioral factors (no substance use, strong academic performance, regular day‑to‑day rhythms) are protective, they were judged insufficient to outweigh the strong affective/physiological signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly predictive self‑report signals: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9, r ≈ 0.59 with PSS), mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 7.5, r ≈ 0.80), and emotional lability (r ≈ 0.67). These measures have very high correlations with PSS in this sample, so elevations plausibly drive higher perceived stress.  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG, PAPAS) which correlate moderately with PSS and can increase perceived burden.  
- Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations in hours that correlate positively with PSS, suggesting some autonomic/nighttime arousal.  
- Countervailing protective physiology: strong circadian amplitude and 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ 0.9 for both), long objective sleep opportunity (median ≈ 10 h, Z = 1.64), low napping, and near‑mean self‑efficacy (NGSE). These features correlate negatively with PSS and likely attenuate the impact of symptoms.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning and weighing evidence
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means (P1 > 21.61; P2 > 20.75). The question is which is likely higher in absolute perceived stress.  
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are very large affective elevations (CES‑D and STAI Zs ≈ 2+) and elevated basal physiology (resting HR/mesor). Those are clinically notable and directly tied to higher PSS in the sample. Although the correlations of those measures with PSS are moderate (≈0.28–0.31), the magnitude of deviation from the sample on multiple affective and physiological measures suggests a substantial elevation in perceived stress relative to peers.  
- Participant 2 shows several predictors that have very high correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD‑7 r = 0.80; emotional lability r = 0.67), but the absolute severity of those symptoms appears milder (GAD‑7 = 7.5 = mild anxiety) than Participant 1’s depressive/anxiety elevations. Crucially, Participant 2 also has multiple robust protective physiological signals (high circadian amplitude/autocorrelation, long objective sleep, low naps) that are strongly associated with lower PSS and are likely to moderate the net perceived stress.  
- Overall, Participant 1’s combination of large affective/trait anxiety elevations plus elevated tonic cardiac markers is stronger evidence of greater overall perceived stress than Participant 2’s mixed profile of moderate self‑report burden plus strong physiological protections.

16,83566,23,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Large affective symptom elevations: CES-D z = 2.47 and STAI z = 2.05 — both sizable deviations above the cohort mean and both measures have modest positive correlations with PSS (~0.28–0.31). These are strong, convergent psychological indicators of higher perceived stress.
- Low current happiness (z = -1.61) and below-average self-esteem (z = -1.29), which align with higher stress in this sample.
- Elevated tonic cardiovascular markers: resting HR z = 1.34 and mesor z = 1.49 — physiological signals consistent with greater baseline arousal that have modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Subjective sleep impairment (PSQI > 5) despite objectively long sleep, suggesting poor restorative sleep quality often associated with stress.
- Late sleep timing and slightly elevated intradaily variability (z = 0.24), consistent with evening arousal/circadian features that can accompany higher stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes perceived stress above the sample mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Marked subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 12) and strong PSQI–PSS association in this dataset (r = 0.50), indicating sleep complaints likely relate to higher perceived stress.
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.65), a domain strongly predictive of perceived stress.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (large positive hourly deviations overnight) and elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = 1.37, mesor z = 1.18), consistent with overnight physiological arousal; these nocturnal HR features correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Very large sleep duration and night-to-night variability (sleep duration z = 2.26; SD z = 2.38), which indicate dysregulated sleep patterns that can be linked to stress-related dysregulation in other contexts (though these metrics have weak direct correlations with PSS here).

Reasons Participant 2 might not have markedly higher PSS (protective or mitigating, relative to their population):
- Lower pain burden and interference (PEG-3 z = -1.39; PAPAS z = -1.24), which are moderately correlated with PSS and therefore protective.
- Relatively intact interpersonal functioning (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z = -1.77) and only mild generalized anxiety (GAD-7 z ≈ -0.59), despite GAD–PSS being highly correlated in the sample.
- The study authors’ synthesis characterizes this participant as near the population mean rather than clearly above it.

Comparative weighing (within each participant’s population frame):
- Participant 1 shows multiple large, convergent psychological deviations (especially depression and trait anxiety with z ≈ 2+), supported by elevated baseline cardiovascular tone and poor subjective sleep; these indicators are directly tied to higher PSS in the sample and the summary explicitly infers PSS above the population mean.
- Participant 2 shows important domain-specific alarms (emotional lability with a strong PSS correlation; nocturnal HR elevations; severe self-reported sleep problems), but these are offset by several protective domains (low pain, good interpersonal functioning, mild generalized anxiety) and several of the most extreme wearable metrics (very long/variable sleep duration) have weak direct associations with PSS in this dataset. The summary appropriately places Participant 2 near the population mean rather than clearly above it.

Final judgment:
- Overall, Participant 1 provides stronger, larger-magnitude, and more consistently stress-linked signals (especially large depressive and trait-anxiety elevations) than Participant 2, whose high-risk signals are more domain-specific and partially offset by protective factors. Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

5,93699,14,13,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe and objectively confirmed sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”) and wearable median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 4 min, plus very large sleep-start variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). These sleep metrics are strongly associated with PSS in the sample.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 with a strong positive correlation to PSS in the sample (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 emotional lability elevated and correlates with PSS (r = 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: Substance abuse subscale Z = 1.75 and positive pain/PSS correlations, which plausibly increase perceived stress.
- Circadian rhythm instability: Low interdaily stability (Z = -1.42), low amplitude (Z = -1.10), and low 24-h autocorrelation—all indicators that correlate with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Strength of associations: Many of the above measures are among the strongest PSS-correlated predictors in the study, giving these signals more weight.

Countervailing (stress-lowering) signals for Participant 1
- Very high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79), which strongly negatively correlates with PSS (r = -0.63).
- Lower resting heart rate/mesor (Zs ≈ -0.55, -0.66), which are modestly protective in this sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), plus somewhat shortened median sleep (~6 h 51 min, z ≈ -0.42) and late sleep timing (median start ~00:59) with some variability.
- Elevated trait anxiety and negative affect markers: STAI–Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27) and lower health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.11); these associate positively with PSS.
- High evening/late-night internet use (z ≈ +2.19), which may contribute to late sleep and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation: resting HR and mesor elevated (z ≈ +0.79 and +0.74), which weakly correlate with higher PSS.

Countervailing (stress-lowering) signals for Participant 2
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D low, z ≈ -0.55) and intact academic functioning (GPA ≈ 3.4).
- Strong day-to-day circadian regularity (interdaily stability z ≈ +0.83; autocorrelation z ≈ +0.81), preserved amplitude—factors associated with lower PSS.
- Limited substance use, little napping, and social/exercise engagement—protective behaviors.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both summaries conclude each participant is likely above their respective population mean, but the magnitude and certainty differ.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators are more numerous, more extreme (e.g., median sleep ≈ 3 hours, very large sleep-timing SD, substance Z = 1.75), and include variables that show very strong correlations with PSS in that sample (GAD-7 r = 0.78; emotional lability r = 0.68; PSQI r = 0.50). Although P1 has a strong protective factor (high self-efficacy), the most PSS-predictive signals are strongly elevated.
- Participant 2 shows a mixed profile with several mild-to-moderate risk indicators (PSQI = 9, late/shorter sleep, elevated evening internet use, modestly higher resting HR) but also multiple protective, regularizing factors (high interdaily stability, low depression, limited substance use). The deviations and correlations for P2’s risk markers are generally smaller/moderate compared with P1’s extreme sleep/circadian and anxiety-related signals.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 exhibits more extreme objective and subjective sleep disruption, stronger anxiety-related signals, and substance-related problems—variables that in that study have strong positive associations with PSS. Participant 2’s stress-related signals are milder and offset to a greater degree by protective features (circadian regularity, low depression, social/exercise).
- Therefore Participant 1 likely has the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), a strong correlate of higher PSS in this dataset.
- Trait anxiety and negative affect: STAI–Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27; classified “anxious”), lower happiness and low health satisfaction (z ≈ −1.11).
- Late, somewhat shortened and variable sleep: median sleep ≈ 6 h 51 min (z ≈ −0.42), sleep start ~00:59, sleep-onset SD ≈ 89 min — patterns associated with greater perceived stress.
- High evening/late-night internet use (z ≈ +2.19) and elevated resting HR/mesor (RHR z ≈ +0.79; mesor z ≈ +0.74), consistent with modestly increased autonomic activation.
- Several of these stress-linked signals (PSQI, anxiety, sleep timing, evening behavior) converge to justify the summary conclusion that this participant is above the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.64), even if the elevation is moderate.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”), which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42). This is the primary signal pointing toward higher perceived stress for this participant.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations (early-morning negative deviations) have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31); these are minor contributors.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each description is written relative to its own population mean. Participant 1 is explicitly judged to be above their sample mean (21.64) based on multiple moderate converging indicators. Participant 2 is explicitly judged to be below their sample mean (21.5), with very strong protective signals (NGSE z ≈ +1.79; GAD-7 z ≈ −1.38; interdaily stability z ≈ +1.84; amplitude z ≈ +1.89; RHR z ≈ −2.23).
- The magnitude and number of stress-elevating indicators for Participant 1 (multiple moderate signals including PSQI, anxiety, sleep timing, evening behavior, elevated RHR) outweigh Participant 2’s limited stress signals (primarily PSQI = 7 and small nocturnal HR associations).
- Participant 2’s strongest predictors (very high self-efficacy, minimal anxiety, strong circadian regularity, very low RHR) are robustly associated with lower PSS in the sample and make it unlikely that Participant 2’s overall PSS is higher than Participant 1’s.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Overall, Participant 1 shows a greater balance of indicators consistent with elevated perceived stress relative to their cohort mean, whereas Participant 2 shows strong, multiple indicators of below-mean perceived stress with only a single moderate counter-signal (PSQI).
- Therefore, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

19,24898,28,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence pushing toward above‑mean perceived stress)
- Strong subjective and objective sleep disturbance:
  - PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0) classified as “disturbed sleep,” and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.47).
  - Extremely short median nightly sleep (2 h 38 min; Z = -0.94) and very high sleep onset variability (SD 281 min, Z = +1.3) — severe disruption that typically elevates perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal:
  - Elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., +13.5 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = +1.17; +9.8 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = +1.59) and overnight HR elevations moderately correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety:
  - GAD‑7 = 10 (moderate anxiety); anxiety had the strongest correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.78), so this is a major risk factor for higher PSS.
- Pain-related interference:
  - PAPAS = 65 (Z = +0.19) and pain correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.48), adding to stress burden.
- Circadian dysregulation:
  - Low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability indicating shifted/unstable schedule with physiological arousal concentrated at night; such dysregulation is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (protective factors)
- Above‑average self-efficacy (New General Self‑Efficacy score Z = +0.3), and self‑efficacy correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.68).
- Low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z = -0.97), buffering against stress (emotional lability correlates positively with PSS, r = 0.72).
- Daytime cardiovascular features and substance/pain indices not strongly elevated.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence pushing toward above‑mean perceived stress)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 45, Z ≈ +0.37), and trait anxiety is a strong psychological correlate of PSS.
- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep) and shorter sleep duration (median 6 h 14 min, Z ≈ -1.18) — both can increase perceived stress.
- Lower self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ -1.01) which modestly associates with higher PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective factors)
- Very strong objective circadian regularity: high interdaily stability (Z ≈ +1.99), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -1.45), large amplitude (Z ≈ +1.64) — these objective rhythm metrics correlate with lower PSS.
- Low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z ≈ -1.04) suggesting lower basal physiological arousal.
- Regular sleep timing and low variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ -1.07), frequent exercise, low substance use, moderate socialization, and higher health satisfaction — lifestyle and behavioral supports that reduce perceived stress.
- Hourly HR profile shows preserved nocturnal recovery and expected daytime peaks; many of these features have negative correlations with PSS in the sample.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each summary is written relative to its own study mean (Participant 1: mean PSS = 20.75; Participant 2: mean PSS = 21.61). The correct comparison is how far above/below each subject lies relative to their population and the strength of the signals that drive those relative positions.
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as “likely above the population mean” with multiple, converging strong risk signals: moderate clinical anxiety (GAD‑7 threshold reached) tied to the strongest PSS correlate in the sample (r = 0.78), very severe objective sleep deprivation and irregularity, and nocturnal physiological arousal — several of which have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in this study.
- Participant 2 is characterized as “near the population mean,” possibly slightly below it if objective physiological regularity is weighted more heavily. The participant presents a mixed profile: some subjective risk factors (trait anxiety, PSQI, shorter sleep) but strong objective protective factors (very high circadian stability, low RHR, regular routines, exercise) that in this sample are associated with lower PSS.
- The strength and number of high‑impact, positively correlated indicators of stress (especially the GAD‑7 link and extreme objective sleep loss/arousal) are greater and more compelling in Participant 1 than the stress‑related signals in Participant 2, whose objectively protective profile offsets their subjective complaints.

Final judgment
- On balance, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population) than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

  - Emotional lability (BASIS‑24 = 6.33) — r ≈ 0.67 with PSS.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9), which correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.59) and exceeds clinical threshold for poor sleep.  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55), both positively correlated with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.47; PAPAS r ≈ 0.50).  
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations during certain late‑night hours, which are associated with higher PSS (example hourly correlations ~0.40–0.45).
- Integrative note: these self‑report indicators (especially anxiety and emotional lability) are among the strongest predictors of PSS in the sample, and the summary explicitly infers this participant is likely above the sample mean PSS (20.75).

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Wearable-derived circadian/behavioral irregularities that are modestly associated with higher PSS:
  - Elevated intradaily variability (fragmentation) — z ≈ +0.81; intradaily variability correlates with PSS ≈ +0.16.
  - Low interdaily stability and low 24‑hr autocorrelation (z ≈ −0.57 and −0.87 respectively), which modestly associate with higher PSS (correlations ≈ −0.12 to −0.17).
  - Reduced cosinor amplitude and lower mesor (amplitude z ≈ −0.63; mesor z ≈ −1.01), consistent with blunted circadian rhythm linked weakly to higher PSS.
  - Shorter nocturnal sleep (median 6 h 33 min, z ≈ −0.79), later sleep timing (~01:02 AM) and somewhat increased naps, which can associate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Integrative note: these signals are the main countervailing evidence against this participant’s otherwise low self‑report stress profile; however, the correlations for these wearable features with PSS are modest.

Comparative, within‑frame weighting of evidence
- Strength of predictors: Participant 1’s indicators that point to higher PSS are dominated by several self‑report measures that have large correlations with PSS in the dataset (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80; emotional lability r ≈ 0.67; NGSE r ≈ −0.66 supporting the inverse). Those measures are highly predictive within Participant 1’s sample frame.
- Participant 2’s indicators that could increase PSS are largely wearable circadian features whose correlations with PSS are markedly smaller (≈ 0.12–0.17). Conversely, Participant 2 has many robust self‑report signals (low depression/anxiety, high happiness/self‑esteem, good subjective sleep, frequent exercise, low substance use) that consistently point to PSS below their sample mean and are reported as the dominant evidence.
- Each description is explicitly interpreted relative to its own population mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be above their population mean (20.75); Participant 2 is inferred to be below their population mean (21.61). Given the relative predictive strengths, Participant 1’s above‑mean status is supported by stronger, higher‑weight correlates than the wearable counter‑signals for Participant 2.

Conclusion
- Overall, when comparing the balance and strength of evidence across the two within‑study frames, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- However, several protective/masking features: regular exercise (z = 1.07), no substance use, high interdaily stability (IS z = 0.67) and substantial reading/leisure (reading z = 4.24) that correlate negatively with PSS and could mitigate perceived stress.

Comparative, within-study-frame reasoning
- Strength and convergence: Participant 1 shows stronger, more convergent indicators across psychological (severe anxiety, low self-efficacy), behavioral (very late/very short sleep), and physiological (nocturnal HR elevations, circadian flattening) domains — many of which have strong correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 2 shows multiple risk signals but they are generally more moderate in magnitude and partially offset by clear protective behaviors (exercise, no substance use, leisure/reading) and some regularity (higher IS).
- Magnitude and clinical severity: P1’s profile includes a clinically severe anxiety score and an extremely abnormal sleep pattern (very short sleep with nocturnal arousal), which are both tightly linked to higher PSS in the P1 study. P2’s largest single physiological z (evening HR spike) is extreme numerically but is a circumscribed pattern and other markers (psychological measures, sleep duration) are only moderately elevated.
- Correlations with PSS: Measures that are highly predictive of PSS in P1’s dataset (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.78; PSQI r = 0.49) are strongly elevated for Participant 1, strengthening confidence that their perceived stress is well above their sample mean. Participant 2’s elevated markers have weaker correlations with PSS in their dataset (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31; RHR r ≈ 0.13) and protective factors blur the signal.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence (severity, convergence across domains, and stronger PSS-relevant correlations) indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study population.

- High internalizing symptoms: Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.65), both associated with higher PSS in this study (correlations 0.27 and 0.31). These are the strongest psychological signals raising inferred stress.
- Subjective sleep problems and irregular timing: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), late median sleep start (~01:15 AM) and high night‑to‑night variability — sleep complaints/moderate timing irregularity correlate positively with PSS.
- Elevated tonic and evening physiological arousal: High mesor (Z = 2.01) and elevated evening heart‑rate deviations (Z ~1.5) consistent with greater physiological activation that can accompany perceived stress.
- Low self‑rated health and low BMI: Very low health satisfaction (Z = -2.03) and underweight BMI may reflect health-related distress that contributes to perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not have as high a PSS score
- Protective objective sleep and circadian regularity: Objective sleep duration is adequate (~7h16m) and interdaily stability and 24‑hr autocorrelation are relatively strong (Zs ~0.9–1.2), features associated with lower PSS.
- Social supports and low substance use: High social time (Z = 2.53) and low substance use that can buffer stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very strong self‑report predictors with large effect sizes: Severe generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, Z = 1.51) where GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r = 0.74) — this is the single strongest predictor across the two profiles. 
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: Very high PSQI (Z = 1.65) with PSQI–PSS r = 0.43.
- High emotional lability and pain/interference: BASIS‑24 emotional lability (Z = 1.03, r = 0.63) and elevated pain/functional interference, both positively correlated with PSS.
- Lower perceived self‑efficacy: NGSE low and strongly negatively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.66), indicating reduced coping resources.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have as high a PSS score
- Robust objective circadian structure and low resting HR: Interdaily stability and low intradaily variability, higher amplitude, and low RHR/mesor (Zs ≈ -0.9 to -1.35) suggest physiological regularity and lower tonic arousal that tend to associate with lower PSS.
- Some specific hourly HR deviations are in directions that predict lower PSS in this sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means (P1 above mean 21.59; P2 above mean 20.54). Thus each is stressed relative to their cohort.
- Strength of predictors matters: Participant 2’s subjective measures include predictors with much larger correlations to PSS (GAD‑7 r = 0.74, emotional lability r = 0.63, PSQI r = 0.43). These high‑impact subjective signals point strongly toward elevated PSS.
- Participant 1 also shows strong symptom elevations (high CES‑D and STAI Zs), but those measures have substantially smaller correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.27–0.31). Several objective and behavioral protective features (adequate objective sleep, strong interdaily stability, high social time) moderate the stress signal for P1.
- On balance, Participant 2’s combination of multiple high‑weight subjective predictors (especially GAD‑7) provides a stronger, more direct indication of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1’s profile, where the most elevated features have weaker statistical links to PSS and are partially counterbalanced by objective resilience markers.

- Strong internalizing symptom burden: High depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 32; Z ≈ +1.95) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z ≈ +1.65). These are large deviations in the sample and are positively associated with PSS.  
- Elevated tonic/evening physiological arousal: High mesor (Z ≈ +2.01) and resting HR (Z ≈ +1.62) and pronounced evening HR elevations—physiological signs consistent with stress-related arousal.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), and irregular sleep timing/variability—these correlate positively with PSS in this sample.  
- Low health satisfaction and underweight BMI (Z ≈ −2.03 and BMI 17.8) that add to an overall distress signal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Multiple self-report predictors strongly linked to PSS: Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; r ≈ 0.59), anxiety (GAD‑7 = 7.5; r ≈ 0.80), and emotional lability (BASIS‑24 = 6.33; r ≈ 0.67). These measures have large correlations with PSS in their sample, so elevations here are powerful predictors.  
- Pain and activity interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS) are nontrivial and positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).  
- Noisy nocturnal HR deviations that align with PSS-related HR patterns (some late‑night hourly HR deviations correlate positively with PSS).

Comparative reasoning within the respective-population frames
- Both participants are explicitly inferred to be above their population mean PSS. That said, the nature of the predictive evidence differs:
  - Participant 1 shows very large deviations on affective measures (CES‑D and STAI Zs near +2 and +1.6) and clear physiologic arousal (HR mesor Z ≈ +2), though the individual correlations of those particular measures with PSS are moderate. The magnitude of those elevations (especially CES‑D ~2 SD above mean) is a strong within-sample signal for elevated perceived stress.
  - Participant 2 has several predictors that have much stronger per-unit correlations with PSS in their sample (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80, emotional lability r ≈ 0.67, PSQI r ≈ 0.59). However, the observed self-report scores for some of those (GAD‑7 = 7.5 = mild anxiety) appear less extreme in absolute deviation terms than Participant 1’s CES‑D/STAI z-scores. Participant 2 also has multiple protective/attenuating wearable signals (robust circadian amplitude/autocorrelation, consolidated daytime activation, long objective sleep) that are associated with lower PSS and likely moderate the predicted elevation.
- Net assessment of weight: Participant 2’s predictors have higher predictive weight per unit (higher correlations), but their observed symptom magnitudes appear moderate and are offset by strong protective physiology. Participant 1’s self-report affect measures are more extreme in magnitude and are corroborated by physiological tone/evening arousal despite those measures having only modest correlations with PSS. The extremity of Participant 1’s depressive and anxious symptoms plus high resting HR/mesor tip the balance toward a greater overall inferred perceived stress burden.

Conclusion
On balance, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress relative to their peers.

- Strong, sample-level-linked anxiety: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.90) and GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.80).  
- Severe objective sleep disruption: extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 min; Z = −1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median ≈ 02:49 AM; start-time SD Z = 1.16), and PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep). Sleep measures here are both extreme and relevant to PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.49).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal tied to PSS: elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations around midnight–2 AM (+8.6 to +9.0 bpm) that have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42). Resting HR is elevated (81.23 bpm; Z = 1.67).  
- Circadian fragmentation associated with stress: low circadian amplitude (Z = −1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = −1.34), and high intradaily variability (Z = 1.23) — a pattern that in this sample maps onto higher PSS.  
- Additional psychosocial burden: elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24) and pain-related interference (PEG-3/PAPAS) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Protective factors (e.g., slightly higher self-efficacy Z = 0.12) are small relative to multiple converging risk signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Elevated affective symptoms that co-occur with PSS: CES-D = 24 (Z = 1.11) and STAI trait anxiety = 44 (Z = 0.27); both correlate positively with PSS in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32).  
- Objective sleep irregularity linked to PSS: shorter-than-average median sleep (6 h 38 min; Z = −0.69) and extremely large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD Z = 3.21) and somewhat elevated variability in sleep start time (start-time SD Z = 1.54). These variability measures have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample.  
- Subjective reductions in positive affect/self-report wellbeing (lower current happiness, slightly lower self-esteem) that align with higher depressive/anxiety scores.  
- Modest physiological signals related to stress (small positive early-morning HR deviations r ≈ 0.14–0.21), but these are weaker than the corresponding physiological signals reported for Participant 1.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and specificity of associations: Participant 1’s key symptom (GAD-7) has a very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.80), whereas Participant 2’s strongest affective indicator (CES-D) has a much more modest correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.29). This implies Participant 1’s elevated anxiety maps more directly to higher PSS in that cohort.  
- Magnitude and extremity of objective signals: Participant 1 shows extreme objective sleep restriction (median ~2.3 hours/night) and elevated nocturnal HR with clear positive PSS correlations; Participant 2’s objective sleep deficits are milder in duration but have very high variability. The severity of Participant 1’s physiological/circadian disruption is greater and more consistently tied to PSS.  
- Protective factors: Participant 2 has numerous strong protective lifestyle and circadian indicators (frequent exercise, high social engagement, high interdaily stability, low resting HR) that counterbalance their affective symptoms more than Participant 1’s modest protective factor (small positive self-efficacy) offsets their severe physiological and anxiety signals.

Overall balance of evidence
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective sample means, but Participant 1’s profile contains more extreme, multilevel (psychological + objective physiological) signals that are strongly associated with PSS in that sample. Participant 2 shows a mixed profile with notable protective behaviors and preserved circadian organization that likely mitigate their elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms. Taken together, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54 (reduced perceived support can elevate stress in context).
- Mild anxiety and elevated basal physiology: GAD-7 = 5.5 (mild) and mesor/resting HR Z ≈ +1.2, which may reflect increased autonomic arousal (although physiological correlations with PSS are weak).

- Small additional physiological cues: modest early-morning HR deviations weakly related to PSS.
- Note: Protective behaviors exist (frequent exercise, socializing, low substance use), but affective elevation and extreme sleep irregularity are salient stress-linked indicators.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1 is described as near or slightly below their study mean PSS (mean = 21.38, SD = 7.34). The most powerful protective signal is high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.41), which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.63). Robust circadian regularity and emotional stability are additional substantial protective factors that, in the author’s integrated judgment, outweigh the moderate-risk signals (poor subjective sleep, pain, interpersonal strain). The net inference given the sample correlations is P1 ≈ mean or modestly below mean PSS.
- Participant 2 is described as above their study mean PSS (mean = 21.63, SD = 3.67). Although P2 has good protective lifestyle factors, they show clinically meaningful depressive symptoms and very large objective sleep irregularity (extreme Z = +3.21 for sleep duration SD). Those affective and sleep-variability indicators are directly linked to higher PSS in the dataset and are judged by the original synthesis to produce a moderate above-mean PSS. Also note the smaller PSS SD in Participant 2’s sample (3.67) — deviations from the mean in that sample map to larger standardized differences than similar absolute deviations in Participant 1’s sample (SD = 7.34).

Overall balance and decision
- Participant 1: mixed profile but strong, high-weight protective factors (NGSE, circadian regularity, emotional stability) produce an inferred PSS near or slightly below their population mean.
- Participant 2: affective symptoms (CES-D), late and highly variable sleep timing (very large Z), and reductions in positive affect constitute a clearer and more consistent pattern toward elevated perceived stress relative to their population mean.
Conclusion: Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

  - Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS; Z ≈ 1.4–1.6).
  - Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73), a robust negative predictor of PSS.
- Physiological corroboration of stress:
  - Pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate deviations (late‑night HR Zs up to ≈ 2.8), late sleep onset (~01:42), and very short median sleep (~4 h 55 min) consistent with hyperarousal and fragmented sleep physiology; some nocturnal HR windows correlate with PSS.
- Net effect: multiple large Z-scores on measures that have relatively strong correlations with PSS produce a coherent, high-stress signal.
- Mitigating factors (reduce but do not outweigh risk): relatively preserved circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, low intradaily fragmentation, average resting HR, and low substance-related score.

  - Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29), which modestly predicts higher PSS.
  - Marginal subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and circadian instability: higher intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.09), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), and variable sleep timing — all consistent with elevated PSS though correlations are modest.
- Protective factors that likely mitigate perceived stress:
  - Frequent exercise (Z ≈ 1.07–1.58), absence of substance use, low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.42), and above‑average self‑reported happiness (Z ≈ 0.55).
- Net effect: several moderate risk indicators pointing above the population mean, but substantial behavioral and physiological resilience signals that would be expected to reduce net perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Magnitude and predictive weight: Participant 1 shows several large-magnitude deviations on measures that are strongly predictive of PSS in that sample (notably severe GAD with very high PSS correlation and large nocturnal HR deviations). Participant 2’s risk measures are generally moderate in magnitude and are tied to weaker sample correlations with PSS.
- Physiological concordance: Participant 1’s objective nocturnal hyperarousal aligns with severe subjective anxiety and very short sleep, strengthening the inference of elevated perceived stress. Participant 2 shows circadian fragmentation but also objective markers of physiological fitness and resilience (frequent exercise, low resting HR) that plausibly offset some subjective symptom burden.
- Net balance: Both participants are described as above their respective population means, but the evidence for Participant 1 indicates a stronger, more coherent, and higher-amplitude stress signal (symptom severity + physiological hyperarousal + low self‑efficacy), whereas Participant 2’s elevated symptoms are partially counterbalanced by robust protective behaviors.

- Marked nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart‑rate deviations (e.g., +13.5 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = +1.17; +9.8 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = +1.59). Overnight HR elevations correlate positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.32–0.38), linking physiology to perceived stress.  
- Clinically relevant anxiety: GAD‑7 = 10 (Z ≈ +0.11), and anxiety symptoms show a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78) — making anxiety a powerful predictor of elevated PSS in this population.  
- Additional contributing signals: some pain/interference (PAPAS = 65, small positive association with PSS, r = 0.48) and circadian irregularity (reduced interdaily stability and autocorrelation, increased intradaily variability) that tend to accompany higher PSS.  
- Net of protective factors: although self‑efficacy is modestly above average (Z = +0.3) and emotional lability is low (Z = −0.97), the magnitude and directness of sleep and anxiety signals (and their relatively strong correlations with PSS in this sample) weigh toward higher perceived stress.

- Circadian/behavioral fragmentation and modest sleep restriction: high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.09), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), and median sleep ~6 h 46 min (Z ≈ −0.52). These features have small-to-moderate associations with higher PSS.  
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z = −1.29) and marginally disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6) also align with greater perceived stress in the sample.  
- Protective factors partially offset risk: frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07–+1.58), absence of substance use, low resting heart rate (Z ≈ −0.42), and somewhat higher self‑reported happiness (Z ≈ +0.55). These behaviors/physiology are associated with lower PSS and lessen the net elevation.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Strength of predictors: In their respective samples, Participant 1’s strongest symptom correlate (anxiety; r = 0.78) is far larger than Participant 2’s symptom correlations with PSS (CES‑D/STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Thus, an equivalent nominal anxiety score in Participant 1 maps onto a larger expected change in PSS (given the sample relationships).  
- Severity and directness of physiological burden: Participant 1 shows extreme objective sleep loss (median ~2.6 h/night) and clear nocturnal cardiovascular arousal with Zs > +1 for overnight HR deviations — relatively direct, high‑impact signals tied to perceived stress. Participant 2’s circadian fragmentation and modest sleep shortness are notable but less extreme (sleep ~6.8 h, intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.09).  
- Protective factors: Both participants have protective elements, but Participant 2’s protective behaviors (regular exercise, no substance use, low RHR, higher happiness) are stronger and more numerous than Participant 1’s protective signals (primarily higher self‑efficacy and low emotional lability). Those protections for Participant 2 likely blunt the impact of their affective symptoms on PSS more effectively than Participant 1’s protections blunt the severe sleep/anxiety signals.  
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s profile contains more extreme, highly PSS‑associated features (severe sleep deprivation, physiological nocturnal arousal, and anxiety that, in this sample, is a very strong predictor of PSS). Participant 2 has moderate-to-moderately elevated affective symptoms and circadian fragmentation but also multiple robust protective behaviors that reduce the expected PSS elevation.

- Highly irregular sleep timing: very large night-to-night variation in sleep start time (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82), indicating circadian instability that is associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 (mild-to-moderate anxiety) and raised Emotional Lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.43); these measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in the cohort.
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain-related measures that correlate positively with PSS—plausible contributors to greater perceived stress.
- Several circadian/HR rhythm metrics indicative of reduced regularity (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, low 24-h autocorrelation), which in this sample modestly associate with higher PSS.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (just above threshold for “disturbed”) and somewhat short median sleep (6 h 46 min; Z ≈ -0.51), with late sleep onset (~01:29 AM).
- Moderate sleep-timing variability (SD ≈ 88 min) and late bedtime, which can degrade restorative sleep and modestly associate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Low frequency of physical exercise and minimal socializing—behavioral risk factors that could reduce resilience and modestly elevate perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each profile is already interpreted relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 was judged by the provided summary to be above their population mean (mean PSS = 21.33, SD = 7.38). Participant 2 was judged to be below their population mean (mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68).
- Strength and number of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple, concordant, and relatively large signals that are strongly correlated with PSS in that cohort (extremely short sleep, massive sleep-timing variability, elevated PSQI, anxiety/emotional lability, substance problems). Several of these have high Z-scores (e.g., sleep timing variability Z = 2.82, substance use Z = 1.75), so the inferred elevation above the population mean is supported by multiple strong indicators.
- Participant 2’s potential risk signals (PSQI = 6, late bedtime, lower exercise/socializing) are comparatively modest in magnitude and fewer in number. They are outweighed by strong protective signals (very low depression/anxiety scores, high self-reported well-being, very high interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation of rhythms).
- Because both populations have similar mean PSS values (~21.3 vs 21.6), the key comparison is the relative strength and direction of each participant’s signals within their cohort. Participant 1’s profile provides much stronger evidence for being above their cohort mean than Participant 2 provides for being above theirs. Participant 2’s overall evidence points below their cohort mean.

Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

- Severe sleep problems: PSQI = 13 (disturbed), extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 m, Z = -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (start-time SD Z = 1.16). Objective sleep disruption here is extreme and tightly linked to stress.
- Marked physiological/ circadian dysregulation: high resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.23) — a cluster commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2 AM that have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42), consistent with nighttime physiological arousal.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24) and pain/interference measures that correlate with higher PSS.
- Only modest protective signal (self-efficacy Z ≈ 0.12), likely insufficient to offset the above.

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective study means, but the strength and convergence of indicators differ. Participant 1 shows some risk signals (notably trait anxiety and subjective sleep complaints) but also multiple protective/neutral features (low resting HR, reasonable circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability, strong academic functioning, limited substance use, and modestly higher reported happiness).

- Participant 2 exhibits multiple, large, and convergent risk signals that are strongly tied to PSS in that cohort: high anxiety with a very large correlation (r = 0.80), extreme objective sleep loss and variability, clear circadian flattening and nocturnal arousal, elevated resting HR, and elevated emotional lability/pain burden. Several of these have sizable Z-scores and sample-level correlations with PSS, supporting a stronger elevation above that population mean.
- Given the magnitude, number, and predictive relevance of Participant 2’s adverse indicators (especially severe sleep restriction/variability, physiological arousal, and a highly PSS-predictive anxiety measure), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely has the higher perceived stress relative to their cohort.

- Modest additional psychosocial negatives: lower health satisfaction (Z = -0.62).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 was judged to be near or slightly below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.38), primarily because strong protective factors (high NGSE Z = 1.41; strong circadian regularity; low emotional lability) appear to outweigh risks. Participant 2 was judged to be slightly above their population mean PSS (mean = 21.63), driven mainly by marked trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and disturbed sleep.
- The strongest predictive relationships reported favor Participant 2 as more stressed: Participant 1’s biggest protective factor (NGSE) has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63) and their anxiety level is only mild (GAD-7 = 5.5). By contrast, Participant 2 shows substantive elevations on trait anxiety and low self-esteem—direct psychological vulnerabilities that more clearly push PSS upward.
- Physiological markers are mixed for both: Participant 1’s slightly elevated resting HR/mesor could reflect stress but correlations with PSS are weak; Participant 2’s low resting HR and strong daytime HR peaks are equivocal and arguably less conclusive than the clear self-report anxiety and esteem issues.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: protective psychological resources (notably high self-efficacy) plus strong behavioral regularity outweigh moderate risks → overall inferred PSS near or slightly below cohort mean.
- Participant 2: multiple convergent self-report vulnerabilities (trait anxiety, PSQI > cutoff, low self-esteem) and behavioral irregularities → overall inferred PSS slightly above cohort mean.

18,62617,18,17,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Reduced interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythm (Z = -1.73): less regular day-to-day timing has been associated with higher stress in population studies.  
- Reduced cardiac circadian amplitude (Z = -1.01): blunted amplitude can reflect lowered physiological resilience and has modest negative associations with well‑being.  
- Evening HR elevations (positive deviations 7–10 pm) and small positive correlations between some early‑morning HR deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.2): suggest occasional evening/night arousal that could relate to perceived stress.  
Notes: these risk signals are moderate in magnitude and described as secondary to strong psychosocial and sleep indicators of low stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 14.5, Z ≈ 0.9) with a very strong sample‑level correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).  
- Markedly disturbed self‑reported sleep (PSQI = 13) and objective severe sleep disruption (median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 19 m, Z = -1.04; very late and highly variable sleep onset), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r = 0.49).  
- Elevated resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = 1.67) and flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57) alongside low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34) and high intradaily variability (Z = 1.23): a physiological profile consistent with chronic arousal and circadian disruption.  
- Marked nocturnal HR elevations (~+8–9 bpm at 12–2 AM) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Elevated emotional lability and pain/interference measures that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., BASIS-24 r = 0.66; pain-related burden r ≈ 0.47).  
Notes: these are multiple, convergent indicators that are described as strongly associated with higher PSS in the participant’s sample.

Comparative, within‑population-frame reasoning
- Each profile is presented relative to its own study mean PSS. Participant 1’s multimodal profile is explicitly interpreted as below the population mean (Population mean PSS = 21.63), driven by large negative Zs for depression and trait anxiety, high happiness and self‑esteem, long consistent sleep (Z = 1.53), and healthy behaviors (exercise, low substance use). The physiological vulnerabilities (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, evening HR elevations) are moderate and characterized as potential but not dominant.  
- Participant 2’s profile is explicitly interpreted as above the population mean (Population mean PSS = 21.17), with several strong, convergent signals: moderate‑to‑high anxiety (GAD-7) that has a very strong correlation with PSS in the sample, extreme objective sleep shortness/irregularity and high PSQI, nocturnal physiological arousal and elevated resting HR, and pain/emotional lability that also correlate with PSS. Many of these signals are both larger in magnitude (notable Zs) and are tied to measures that have strong sample‑level correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.80).  
- Overall balance: Participant 1 shows primarily protective psychosocial and behavioral indicators with only modest physiological irregularities; Participant 2 shows multiple, robust risk indicators (self‑report anxiety, severe sleep disruption, nocturnal physiological arousal, pain/emotional lability) that are each described as strongly associated with higher PSS in that cohort.

Decision
- Participant 2 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

21,69057,30,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z ≈ +1.16). This is a moderate predictor of PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.31).
- Objective and subjective sleep disturbance: very short wearable sleep (median ≈ 5 h 35 min; Z ≈ −1.99) and PSQI = 7 (disturbed). Short/poor sleep commonly associates with higher PSS.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (lower interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.74; higher intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.39) and late sleep timing (~02:08) — patterns that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate peak (5–6 PM, Z ≈ +1.79) and delayed physiological timing, suggesting elevated evening arousal.
- Contextual stressor: declining academic performance (GPA drop), lower self-rated health and happiness, modestly reduced self-esteem.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 12; Z ≈ +0.46) and this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a high-impact predictor.
- Very severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 17.5; Z ≈ +1.32), with PSQI also moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (midnight–3am deviations Z ≈ +0.7 to +1.0) that correlate positively with PSS (≈0.22–0.39), indicating nocturnal autonomic arousal.
- Poor emotional regulation (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability; correlates ≈0.68 with PSS) and reduced self-efficacy (NGSE low; correlates ≈−0.66 with PSS), both supporting a greater perceived stress profile.
- Elevated substance-abuse score (Z ≈ +1.5), which is a potential stress-related behavior to monitor (though its correlation with PSS is negligible here).

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both participants are described as having inferred PSS above their respective sample means. The question is which profile implies a relatively higher perceived stress overall.
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 2’s top predictors (GAD-7 and PSQI) have much larger correlations with PSS in their sample (≈0.77 and ≈0.45) than Participant 1’s strongest listed predictor (STAI r ≈ 0.31). Participant 2 also has strong emotional-lability and self-efficacy signals that are highly correlated with PSS (≈0.68 and −0.66), amplifying the likely PSS elevation.
- Severity/magnitude of symptom signals: Participant 2’s PSQI is extreme (17.5 of a maximum ~21) and nocturnal HR deviations are substantial; Participant 1’s PSQI is only mildly elevated (7) though objective sleep is very short. Participant 1 also has several substantial protective factors (low resting HR/mesor consistent with fitness, frequent exercise, low substance use, low depressive symptoms) that mitigate inferred stress, whereas Participant 2 has fewer protective buffers (some objective sleep duration and decent circadian regularity but prominent psychological/autonomic stress markers and higher substance-abuse score).
- Physiological evidence: Participant 2 shows nocturnal heart-rate elevations that correlate with PSS; Participant 1’s physiological features indicating late-evening activation are less strongly correlated with PSS in their sample.
- Net balance: Participant 1 shows a mix of risk (anxiety, very short sleep, circadian irregularity) and fairly strong protective factors. Participant 2 shows several high-impact, highly correlated risk indicators (anxiety, extreme subjective sleep disturbance, emotional lability, nocturnal HR elevations, lower self-efficacy) with fewer strong mitigators.

Overall judgment
- Although both are assessed as above their sample means, the pattern of stronger, higher-correlation psychological predictors and more severe subjective sleep disturbance (plus nighttime autonomic arousal and reduced coping/self-efficacy) indicates that Participant 2 likely has the higher PSS relative to their study population.

- Objective and subjective sleep disturbance: short wearable sleep (median 5 h 35 min; Z = −1.99) and PSQI = 7 (disturbed).
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (lower interdaily stability Z = −0.74; intradaily variability Z = +0.39).
- Late sleep timing and pronounced evening heart-rate peak (5–6 PM +22.8 bpm; Z = +1.79) suggesting elevated evening physiological activation.
- Contextual stressor: declining academic performance (GPA drop) and lower self-rated health/happiness and modestly reduced self-esteem.
(Protective features that likely mitigate PSS: very low resting HR/mesor (Z ≈ −1.7 to −2.2), frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), low substance use, social activity, and no elevated depressive symptoms.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10.5) with a very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale; r ≈ 0.65) and strong survey-based signals linked to higher PSS.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8.5) with moderate-to-strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.55).
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3; PAPAS Z = 1.21) — positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2am (+13–14 bpm; Z ≈ +1.25–1.36), with those nighttime HR deviations correlated with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).
- High night-to-night sleep variability (SD 199 min; Z = +0.65), which can exacerbate stress even if median sleep is long.
(Protective features: modestly higher self-efficacy (Z ≈ +0.12) but strongly predictive of lower PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.65), good circadian regularity/amplitude (Zs ≈ +0.6–0.97), low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.86), and low substance-use problems.)

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and predictive power of indicators: Participant 2’s key self-report predictors (GAD-7, emotional lability, PSQI) have substantially larger correlations with PSS in their sample (e.g., r ≈ 0.77, 0.65, 0.55) than Participant 1’s strongest predictors (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31, intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16). This makes the evidence for elevated PSS stronger and more directly predictive in Participant 2’s profile.
- Convergent physiological corroboration: Participant 2’s nocturnal HR elevations align with high-correlation survey measures, giving multiple independent signals pointing toward higher perceived stress. Participant 1 shows elevated evening activation and very short sleep, but the HR–PSS correlations for those specific features are smaller in that sample.
- Protective factors and buffering: Participant 1 has pronounced protective physiologic/behavioral features (very low resting HR/mesor, frequent exercise) that plausibly blunt perceived stress. Participant 2 also has protective features (self-efficacy, circadian regularity), but self-efficacy is only slightly above average (Z ≈ +0.12) and likely provides less buffering against multiple strong stress signals than Participant 1’s robust fitness/exercise pattern.
- Overall balance: Both profiles are judged above their respective study means, but Participant 2’s profile contains stronger, higher-correlation psychological predictors (clinically meaningful anxiety, emotional lability, disturbed sleep) plus corroborating nocturnal HR and pain measures. Participant 1’s elevated-risk features are notable (very short sleep, trait anxiety, late timing) but are counterbalanced more substantially by clear protective physiology/behavior.

Conclusion
- Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study mean) than Participant 1.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52, Z = +1.06), which correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r = 0.31). This is described as a primary contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z = +0.38; classified “Depressed”), positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.28).
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05), a reasonable predictor of higher PSS (r ≈ 0.43 reported elsewhere in text for PSQI).
- Objective sleep/circadian signs consistent with stress: short median sleep (5 h 58 min, Z = −1.52), very late sleep onset (~02:25 AM), elevated intradaily variability (Z = +0.46), lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = −0.19), and pronounced evening heart-rate deviation (5–6 pm Z = +1.69). Several of these measures have modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Holistic integration in the description explicitly infers PSS above the sample mean (21.59).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z = +1.51) and this measure has an extremely strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.74) — single strongest predictor in the data.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5, Z = +1.65), with PSQI correlated positively with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = +1.03) with strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.63).
- Elevated pain/functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS composite) and lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.44; NGSE r = −0.66), both associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- The summary explicitly infers PSS above the cohort mean (20.54), with subjective measures judged to outweigh some protective objective signals.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing evidence
- Both participants are described as above their respective study means, but the strength of evidence differs.
- Participant 1: multiple moderate elevations (STAI Z ≈ +1.06, PSQI Z ≈ +1.05, CES-D Z ≈ +0.38) and some physiological/circadian signatures consistent with higher stress, but several protective behaviors (frequent exercise, good self-rated health, high interpersonal trust) and effect sizes for the strongest predictors are modest (e.g., STAI–PSS r = 0.31).
- Participant 2: several large subjective deviations (GAD-7 Z = +1.51; PSQI Z = +1.65; Emotional Lability Z = +1.03) and critically, those subjective measures have much larger correlations with PSS in the sample (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74, Emotional Lability r = 0.63, NGSE r = −0.66). Although Participant 2 shows wearable-derived signs of physiological regularity (lower RHR, higher interdaily stability) that are protective, the subjective signals that most strongly predict PSS are substantially larger in magnitude and effect size than Participant 1’s strongest predictors.
- Therefore, when reasoning within each study’s frame (i.e., relative to each population mean and accounting for predictor effect sizes), Participant 2’s profile indicates a higher likelihood of a more elevated PSS relative to their cohort than Participant 1’s profile does relative to theirs.

- Strong self-report signals that correlate highly with PSS in this sample:
  - Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5) and emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 6.33); these scales have very large sample correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.80; emotional lability r = 0.67), making them powerful predictors of above-mean PSS.
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; PSQI–PSS r = 0.59) and pain/interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) which also positively correlate with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50).
- Some nocturnal heart-rate elevations at specific late-night hours correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with arousal-linked stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Multiple strong and multilevel indicators pointing toward above-mean PSS:
  - Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52; Z = +1.06) — a robust positive correlate of PSS in the dataset.
  - Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, “Depressed”) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).
  - Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; Z = +1.05) plus objectively short and very late sleep (median sleep 5h58m, Z = −1.52; median start ~02:25 AM), producing limited nocturnal recovery.
  - Circadian fragmentation and instability: higher intradaily variability (IV Z = +0.46) and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (Z = −0.19); these features correlate with higher PSS in this sample.
  - Physiological activation: elevated mesor and resting HR (mesor Z ≈ +0.95, resting HR Z = +0.47) and a large evening heart-rate departure (5–6 pm Z = +1.69) consistent with sustained arousal.
- Protective behaviors (frequent exercise, high interpersonal trust, good self-rated health) are present but described as having small or negligible sample-level correlations with PSS and do not outweigh the pattern of elevated mood symptoms, poor/delayed sleep, and physiological fragmentation.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1: Key predictors with the largest sample correlations (anxiety and emotional lability, PSQI) point toward above-mean PSS, but strong objective protective signals (high circadian amplitude and 24-h autocorrelation, long objective sleep time, consolidated daytime activation) are substantial and likely moderate the elevation. The narrative explicitly judges P1 as above the population mean but attenuated by physiological regularity.
- Participant 2: Convergent elevation across trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, subjective sleep disturbance, objective short/delayed sleep, circadian fragmentation, and physiological activation gives a more consistently elevated profile relative to that study’s mean. Several of these indicators are >1 SD from the sample mean (e.g., STAI Z ≈ +1.06, PSQI Z ≈ +1.05, short sleep Z ≈ −1.52, evening HR deviation Z ≈ +1.69), suggesting a stronger deviation above the population mean than Participant 1’s deviations.

Overall balance of evidence
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means. However, Participant 2’s elevation is supported by a broader and more consistent set of elevated self-report and objective measures, with several measures showing larger standardized deviations and physiological corroboration of sustained arousal and circadian disruption.
- Participant 1’s strongest predictors of higher PSS are self-report symptoms with very high correlations to PSS, but these are partly offset by robust, protective circadian and daytime physiological organization (several objective Zs strongly positive for protective features), suggesting a more moderate elevation above that study’s mean.

- Strongly elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ 0.67). In this sample PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.53).
- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ 0.93), also strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), and NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.69), so this is a likely contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations and higher mesor/resting HR (Mesor Z ≈ 0.7; RHR Z ≈ 0.61) concentrated at midnight–early-morning hours; these physiological markers correlate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83), indicating irregular daily timing, which is associated (albeit modestly) with higher PSS.
- Integrated summary states the participant is likely above their study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.29).

Mitigating factors noted for Participant 1 (limit but do not eliminate higher PSS inference)
- Low-moderate GAD-7 (5; Z = -0.76) which would push PSS down (anxiety correlates strongly with PSS).
- Long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 4 min; Z = 0.92), low intradaily variability (Z = -1.28), and slightly lower emotional lability — these temper but do not outweigh the strong sleep/pain/physiology signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high sedentary/screen-time behaviors (video games Z = 4.74, TV Z = 3.17, internet Z = 2.19) which can reduce active coping and relate modestly to higher PSS.
- Low social-trust (Z = -2.39), a potential interpersonal risk factor for stress.
- Late median sleep start (~01:04 AM), which can be associated with social/scheduling strain.
- Modestly elevated heart-rate mesor and amplitude (Mesor Z ≈ 1.35; amplitude Z ≈ 1.72) and somewhat higher resting HR (Z ≈ 0.51) — small correlations with PSS exist in the sample.
- Very low physical activity/exercise frequency (strongly negative Zs), removing a behavioral buffer against stress.

Mitigating (protective) factors for Participant 2 that argue against high PSS
- Extremely low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0; Z = -1.38) and very low trait anxiety (STAI-T Z = -2.11) — both strongly protective; both measures correlate positively with PSS.
- High self-esteem (Rosenberg Z = 1.1) and high momentary happiness (Z = 1.64).
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 3; Z = -1.72) and stable objective sleep/circadian metrics (interdaily stability Z = 2.4, 24-h autocorrelation Z = 2.24, low IV Z = -2.29) — robust signals associated with lower PSS.
- Integrated summary states the participant is likely below their study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.64).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participant summaries are explicit about relative position versus their respective study means: Participant 1 is inferred above their population mean (21.29); Participant 2 is inferred below their population mean (21.64).
- The strongest upward drivers for Participant 1 are multiple, moderately-to-strongly correlated indicators (high PSQI and PAPAS with r ≈ 0.53; low NGSE with r ≈ -0.69; notable nocturnal HR deviations). These are coherent and converge on elevated perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows very strong protective signals (near-zero depressive symptoms, very low trait anxiety, high circadian regularity) that outweigh the behavioral risk factors (sedentary time, late sleep, modestly higher HR). The protective signals are both large in magnitude (Zs) and tied to constructs that correlate with PSS strongly in this sample.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s key risk markers are directly and strongly associated with higher PSS in that sample; Participant 2’s main risk markers are weaker correlates, while their protective markers are both large and of the types most predictive of low PSS.

Weighted judgment
- Considering the balance of evidence within each participant’s study context, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit higher perceived stress than Participant 2.

10,14571,10,12,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.42), so this single strong subjective complaint could elevate perceived stress relative to peers.
- Objective nocturnal HR deviations: early-morning heart-rate deviations (Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31); these could modestly increase PSS.
- Discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep (good actigraphic duration but poor PSQI) — such mismatch is often associated with distress and could be linked to higher perceived stress even if other indicators are favorable.
- Although many protective signals are strong, they are not all uniformly extreme (e.g., GAD Z = -1.38 vs. Participant 2’s STAI Z = -2.11), so there remains room for a PSS score closer to the mean than someone with multiple extreme protective scores.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- High sedentary / screen time: very large Z-scores for video games (Z = 4.74), TV/videos (Z = 3.17), internet (Z = 2.19) — while correlations with PSS are modest, such behaviors can reduce active coping and social engagement and thereby elevate stress risk.
- Low social-trust (Z = -2.39): lower interpersonal trust/support can contribute to perceived stress independent of internal symptom levels.
- Late sleep timing: median sleep start ≈ 01:04 AM — late timing can be associated with social or scheduling strain.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular tone: HR mesor Z ≈ +1.35 and amplitude Z ≈ +1.72 (resting HR Z ≈ +0.51) may reflect higher tonic arousal that has a small positive correlation with PSS.
- Low exercise/physical activity: removes a protective buffer against stress over time.

Comparative, within-population interpretation
- Both participants are described as having PSS below their respective population means (P1 mean = 21.5; P2 mean = 21.64). The question is which is relatively higher within their own sample.
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple very strong protective signals: near-zero depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = -1.38), very low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -2.11), high self-esteem and momentary happiness, very high circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = 2.4; 24-h autocorr Z = 2.24) and good PSQI (Z = -1.72). The summary explicitly indicates P2 is likely nearer the lower quartile of the sample PSS distribution.
- Participant 1 also has strong protective signals (maximum NGSE Z = +1.79, very low resting HR Z = -2.23, low GAD Z = -1.38, high circadian stability) but has a notable countervailing signal in subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and some nocturnal HR patterns modestly associated with PSS. The summary concludes P1 is below the sample mean but highlights that sleep complaints “warrant attention,” suggesting P1 may not be as far below the mean as P2.
- In short: P2’s protective indicators are more numerous and in several cases more extreme (especially trait anxiety and circadian regularity), and the summary characterizes P2 as likely nearer the lower quartile. P1’s single prominent risk (disturbed PSQI) is more directly linked to PSS than some of P2’s risk factors, but overall P1’s profile appears closer to the mean than P2’s.

Weighed conclusion
- Although both participants are below their sample means, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is likely to have the higher PSS (i.e., less extremely low stress) compared with Participant 2, who appears to be further toward the low end of the distribution.

24,45076,33,29,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Strong, large-magnitude self-report predictors of PSS: very elevated generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = 1.51) and severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65). The GAD-7 in this sample is strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.74) and PSQI also correlates positively (r = 0.43), so these are high-weight indicators of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63) and elevated pain/interference (PEG-3, PAPAS composite) which also associate with higher PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) and other psychosocial vulnerabilities that correlate reasonably strongly with PSS (NGSE r = -0.66).
- Convergent pattern across multiple subjective domains (anxiety, sleep, affect lability, pain, low coping) yielding consistent evidence for above-mean perceived stress despite some protective objective features.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Mild-to-moderate risk signals: modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.27) and mild depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 0.18); PSQI = 6 indicates clinically meaningful sleep complaints—these factors correlate positively with PSS (though with smaller r values than for Participant 1’s strongest predictors).
- Circadian irregularity: reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.74) and some intradaily fragmentation (Z = 0.32) which are associated with higher PSS in this sample; some early-morning HR deviations correlate positively with PSS.
- Small negative signals in recent happiness and health satisfaction (small-to-moderate Zs) that trend with higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or not clearly higher) PSS score
- Relatively strong protective factors: notably high self‑esteem (Z = 1.38), frequent exercise (Z > 1 on several items), low substance use, good academic performance and social/trust resources—these are associated with lower PSS and are sizable effects in the profile.
- Healthy physiological baseline and sleep quantity: adequate median sleep duration (7 h 38 min, Z = 0.56), low resting HR, low BMI—these support resilience and argue against a large elevation in perceived stress.
- Overall risk indicators are modest in magnitude; protective signals are larger for some metrics (e.g., self-esteem).

Comparative reasoning within their respective study frames
- Directionality relative to each cohort mean: Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes they are likely above their population mean (20.54), driven by several large, strongly correlated subjective risk measures (especially GAD-7 and PSQI) with large Zs. Participant 2’s summary concludes they are near their population mean (21.6), perhaps slightly above it, but the risk elevations are generally small and counterbalanced by sizable protective factors (notably self‑esteem and exercise).
- Magnitude and strength of predictors: Participant 1’s top predictors are both larger in standardized deviation (Z) and more strongly correlated with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.74; BASIS-24 r = 0.63) than Participant 2’s risk indicators (STAI/CES-D r ≈ 0.28–0.31; PSQI and circadian irregularity smaller correlations). This makes the inference of elevated PSS for Participant 1 stronger and more certain.
- Objective physiology: Participant 1 has some protective circadian/HR features, but the report emphasizes subjective measures dominate prediction of PSS. Participant 2’s objective physiology offers more protective evidence (adequate sleep duration, exercise, low substance use) that substantially offsets their modest risks.
- Net balance: Participant 1 shows multiple, large subjective risk signals that converge on above-mean perceived stress in that cohort. Participant 2 shows weaker risk signals and several strong protective signals, giving a near-mean (slightly above) inferred PSS. Thus, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is likely to exhibit the worse (higher) overall perceived stress relative to their respective cohort means.

- Severe objective and subjective sleep disruption:
  - PSQI = 16.5 (disturbed sleep; Z = 1.0) and wearable median sleep = 2 h 38 min (Z = -0.94). Both subjective and objective sleep markers are strongly linked to higher PSS in this sample.
  - Very irregular sleep timing (sleep onset SD 281 min, Z = 1.3) and shifted circadian measures, which are associated with increased perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal:
  - Elevated overnight heart‑rate deviations (e.g., +13.54 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = 1.17; +9.79 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = 1.59). Overnight HR elevations correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Anxiety and pain-related interference:
  - GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety; meets screening threshold). Anxiety symptoms in this study have a very strong correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), so presence of clinically relevant anxiety strongly favors higher perceived stress.
  - PAPAS pain/interference elevated (Z = 0.19) and correlates with PSS (r = 0.48).
- Circadian instability and daytime physiological patterning that concentrate arousal during usual sleep hours, which in aggregate is linked to higher PSS.

Potential mitigating factors (not asked to list but relevant): higher self‑efficacy (Z = 0.3, r ≈ -0.68) and low emotional lability (Z = -0.97, r ≈ 0.72) are protective and reduce the expected PSS to some extent.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Mild elevations in anxiety and depressive symptoms:
  - STAI trait ≈ 44 (Z = 0.27) and CES‑D = 15 (Z = 0.18); both positively correlated with PSS (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28), so they push toward higher perceived stress but only modestly.
- Subjective sleep complaints:
  - PSQI = 6 (above common clinical cutoff), and somewhat late sleep timing (median ~00:57) with night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 63 min) — subjective sleep disturbance is associated with higher PSS.
- Some circadian irregularity/fragmentation:
  - Lower interdaily stability (Z = -0.74) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.32); early-morning HR deviations modestly correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).

Stronger protective features that counterbalance risk (important context):
- High self‑esteem (Z = 1.38), frequent exercise (Z > 1 on several items), low resting HR, low substance use, good academic performance and low BMI — many of these are associated with lower PSS and are sizable effects in this profile.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Magnitude and salience of risk signals: Participant 1 shows very large, objective, and physiologically concordant indicators of stress (extreme short sleep, severe irregularity, pronounced nocturnal HR elevations) plus clinically relevant anxiety with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.78). These are high-salience, high-impact signals for elevated perceived stress in that study population.
- Participant 2’s risk signals are generally mild-to-moderate (small positive z-scores on anxiety/depression, PSQI at cutoff, circadian irregularity) and are substantially offset by strong protective factors (notably high self‑esteem and frequent exercise). The net inference in the description is “near the mean, possibly slightly above,” not clearly or strongly above.
- Both descriptions are relative to their study means (P1 mean 20.75; P2 mean 21.6). Even given that P2’s population mean is slightly higher, the profile-level evidence for elevated PSS is much stronger for Participant 1 relative to their own mean than it is for Participant 2 relative to theirs.

Conclusion (weighing overall evidence): Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Strong clinical anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ +1.51). Anxiety in this sample has a large positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.75), making this a very powerful predictor of elevated perceived stress.  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83), which correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) and is consistent with higher perceived stress.  
- High pain/interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ +1.4–1.6; these have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42) and likely increase daily strain.  
- Low general self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ −1.73; self-efficacy correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.61), so this is a strong stress-amplifying factor.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large positive nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., Z up to ≈ +2.83 overnight) and late, short sleep (median start ≈ 01:42, median duration ≈ 4:55) align with hyperarousal and correlate with PSS (some nocturnal windows r ≈ 0.34).  
- Integrated effect size: Multiple large Z-scores on measures with strong sample correlations to PSS (especially anxiety and self-efficacy) create a coherent, relatively large inferred elevation above the population mean (mean PSS = 20.62).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety and subjective sleep problems (but modest): STAI = 44 (Z ≈ +0.27) and PSQI = 8 (Z ≈ +0.59). These are associated with higher PSS but are relatively small-to-moderate deviations.  
- Marked circadian/behavioral irregularity: Very low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.56) and high variability in sleep start time (sleep start SD Z ≈ +1.48). Irregular timing is associated with higher perceived stress and poorer regulation.  
- Elevated evening/late-night HR deviations and modestly higher MESOR (Z ≈ +0.46) which can reflect some increased physiological tone.  
- Protective factors that reduce inferred stress magnitude: Long median nightly sleep (8.0 h, Z ≈ +1.01), frequent sports participation (Z ≈ +1.58), normal depressive symptoms (CES-D ≈ 0 Z), low nap frequency (Z ≈ −0.86), and typical resting HR — these moderate the inferred elevation.  
- Integrated effect size: Evidence points to a mild-to-moderate elevation above the study mean (mean PSS = 21.6) but with substantial mitigating factors, so the inferred elevation appears smaller and less symptom-severe than Participant 1’s.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and directness of PSS predictors: Participant 1 shows multiple large deviations on measures known in this sample to have strong associations with PSS (especially GAD-7 and low NGSE). Participant 2’s strongest deviations are circadian irregularity metrics (large Zs) but the self-report symptom elevations that most strongly predict PSS are smaller.  
- Physiological corroboration: Participant 1 has large nocturnal HR deviations (very high Zs) that align with severe anxiety and poor sleep, providing coherent physiological and self-report convergence. Participant 2 shows some elevated evening HR/MESOR but overall physiological baselines and recovery (long sleep, normal resting HR) are more supportive of resilience.  
- Net balance: Participant 1’s combination of severe anxiety, disturbed sleep, pain/interference, low self-efficacy, and strong nocturnal physiological arousal represents a stronger, more direct set of predictors of higher perceived stress relative to that study’s mean than Participant 2’s mixed pattern of moderate symptom elevation plus protective behaviors.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; above clinical cutoff; Z ≈ +0.59).
- Strong circadian irregularity (very low interdaily stability Z = −1.56) and large sleep-start timing variability (sleep start SD Z = +1.48) — behaviors linked with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Lower momentary happiness (Z = −0.53) and slightly reduced self-esteem (Z ≈ −0.17), which associate with higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10.5 at screening threshold), with a very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale Z ≈ +0.53; r ≈ 0.65 with PSS).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8.5; above clinical cutoff; r ≈ 0.55) and substantial pain/interference (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +1.21; both positively correlated with PSS).
- Pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2am (Z ≈ +1.25 to +1.36), which in this dataset correlate positively with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).
- Night-to-night sleep variability (SD 199 min; Z ≈ +0.65) that can exacerbate subjective stress.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both participants are assessed as likely above their respective population means. However, the strength and type of indicators differ.
- Participant 1’s above-mean inference rests on a mix of self-report (moderate anxiety, PSQI) and marked behavioral irregularity (very low interdaily stability and large sleep-timing variability). Many of these circadian/behavioral markers have only modest correlations with PSS in the dataset, and several protective factors (long median sleep, frequent sports, normal depressive symptoms) moderate the overall elevation.
- Participant 2’s above-mean inference is supported by multiple strong, directly predictive self-report measures (GAD-7 with very high correlation to PSS; elevated emotional lability) plus corroborating physiological signals (notable nocturnal HR elevations and pain interference). Although Participant 2 also shows resilience markers (good circadian regularity, low resting HR, high self-efficacy), the highest-weight predictors of PSS in this dataset (especially GAD-7 and emotional lability) are stronger and more directly linked to PSS than Participant 1’s strongest predictors.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows stronger, more directly predictive signals of elevated perceived stress (clinically meaningful anxiety with very high correlation to PSS, emotional lability, pain, and marked nocturnal HR elevations).
- Participant 1 shows meaningful signs of elevated stress, notably circadian irregularity and sleep disturbance, but these are overall more moderate predictors of PSS in this dataset and are counterbalanced by several protective factors.

21,89652,30,28,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Sleep/circadian irregularity: very late median sleep start (02:54), shorter median sleep (6 h 34 m, z = -0.76), large night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 172 min, z = 1.62). These features can be associated with greater perceived stress.
- Fragmented daily rhythms: elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (z = 1.30) and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (z = -0.87) suggest inconsistent daily structure or fragmented rhythms.
- Compensatory daytime sleep: slightly elevated mean daily naps (z = 1.49) consistent with disrupted nocturnal sleep.
- Note on strength: these metrics have only modest positive correlations with PSS in this sample (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15; sleep variability r ≈ 0.13), so they provide limited evidence for higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety: GAD‑7 = 12 with very strong association to PSS (corr ≈ 0.77), a major predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 17.5 (z = 1.32), which correlates moderately with PSS (corr ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: large overnight heart‑rate deviations (e.g., +11.9 bpm at 12–1am) that correlate positively with PSS (≈0.22–0.39), indicating impaired nocturnal recovery.
- Emotional lability and lower coping: BASIS‑24 emotional lability correlates ≈0.68 with PSS; NGSE (self‑efficacy) is lower and strongly negatively associated with PSS (corr ≈ -0.66).
- Additional risk behavior signal: elevated substance‑abuse subscale (z ≈ 1.5), though its direct correlation with PSS here is small.
- Note on strength: multiple high-impact indicators (especially GAD‑7 and PSQI) have strong-to-moderate correlations with PSS, and physiological markers converge with these psychological signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 was evaluated relative to a mean PSS = 21.6; the dominant evidence in their profile is low self‑reported distress (low CES‑D, low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, good PSQI) which strongly supports a below‑mean PSS. The contrary signals (circadian/sleep irregularity) have only small correlations with PSS in that study and therefore carry less weight.
- Participant 2 was evaluated relative to a mean PSS = 20.67; their profile contains several high‑impact indicators that are strongly or moderately correlated with PSS in that study (notably GAD‑7 and PSQI), plus convergent nocturnal HR elevations and reduced self‑efficacy. These provide stronger and multi‑modal evidence of above‑mean perceived stress.

Balance of evidence and decision
- The evidence that would push Participant 1 above their sample mean is relatively weak and limited to wearable-derived rhythm irregularities with small correlations to PSS, while subjective and behavioral measures strongly argue for below‑mean stress.
- The evidence that places Participant 2 above their sample mean is stronger and multi‑modal: high anxiety (the single strongest predictor), very poor subjective sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, and reduced self‑efficacy—variables with moderate‑to‑strong correlations to PSS in that study.

- Marked circadian / sleep irregularity: very late median sleep onset (~02:54), modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m), large night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 172 min). These features are associated with higher stress in the literature.
- Elevated rhythm fragmentation: higher intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.30) and low 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.87) indicate fragmented daily structure that correlates modestly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.13–0.15).
- Slightly increased daytime napping (mean daily naps z = 1.49), consistent with compensatory sleep and possible sleep disturbance.
- Note: these objective indicators have only small positive correlations with PSS in this study, so their contribution to higher PSS is modest.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Strongly elevated self-report predictors of PSS: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16, z = 1.16; GAD‑7 r with PSS ≈ 0.78), very poor PSQI (15, r ≈ 0.49), high pain/interference (PEG‑3 z = 1.18) and emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z = 1.23; r ≈ 0.65). Low self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55) also predicts higher PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Convergent wearable evidence of extreme sleep/circadian disruption: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m), late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.3), low interdaily stability and very low 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.4), reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.4).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal corroborating subjective distress: marked HR elevations during typical sleep hours that correlate with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.40; 2–3am r ≈ 0.38; 3–4am r ≈ 0.36).
- These subjective and physiological markers are both strong and mutually corroborating in this dataset.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is given relative to its study’s mean PSS. Participant 1’s integrated conclusion explicitly favors PSS at or below their population mean (21.6), because strong subjective wellbeing and low depression/anxiety outweigh modest wearable-derived irregularities that only weakly correlate with PSS.
- Participant 2’s integrated conclusion explicitly favors PSS above their population mean (20.92), with multiple self-report measures that strongly predict PSS and wearable physiology (very short sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, high intradaily variability) that corroborate elevated stress.
- The evidence for Participant 2 is both stronger (larger effect sizes / z‑scores) and more convergent across high‑PSS predictors than the evidence suggesting elevated PSS for Participant 1 (which is limited and weakly correlated with PSS).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 exhibits multiple, strongly correlated indicators (severe anxiety, very poor sleep, low self‑efficacy, nocturnal physiological arousal) that consistently point to PSS above their sample mean.
- Participant 1 shows mainly low subjective distress and high wellbeing (pointing below their mean), with only modest wearable signals that could raise risk but are weakly associated with PSS in this cohort.
- Therefore, Participant 2 is far more likely to have the higher overall perceived stress.

4,21793,31,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their cohort):
- Very high clinical anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ +1.51) and anxiety in this sample is strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.75). This is the single strongest predictor in the profile.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance and short sleep: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83) plus median sleep ≈ 4 h 55 min and late sleep onset (~01:42) — these features correlate with higher PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.47; some nocturnal HR windows r ≈ 0.34).
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Zs ≈ +1.4–1.6, which are meaningfully associated with higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -1.73; self-efficacy correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.61), so this is a strong risk factor.
- Objective nocturnal physiological arousal: Large positive nocturnal HR deviations (several hourly deviation Zs > +2) consistent with hyperarousal and aligned with the self-report stressors.
- Relative balance: while there are some protective circadian regularity features, the strongest predictors (severe anxiety, pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal arousal) are large and tightly linked to PSS in this cohort.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their cohort):
- Disturbed sleep timing and variability: PSQI = 9 (Z ≈ +1.05), very late median sleep start (~03:36) and large start-time SD (Z ≈ +1.04). Sleep-start variability and PSQI both positively relate to PSS.
- Strong circadian irregularity/fragmentation: Very low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.98) and elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.95); these rhythm disruptions modestly correlate with higher PSS in this sample.
- High nap frequency: Mean daily naps Z ≈ +3.05, which is an extreme deviation and weakly positively associated with PSS.
- Some trait anxiety and mood signals: STAI Z ≈ +0.17 and CES-D Z ≈ +0.18—these are elevated but small relative to cohort and less extreme than Participant 1’s anxiety.
- External stressor signal: academic decline (drop in GPA) and reduced trust/less restorative activity may add to perceived stress.
- Protective factors that reduce the stress signal: low resting HR and low MESOR (Zs ~ -0.47 and -1.13) and minimal substance use, which tend to buffer physiological arousal and slightly offset stress indicators.

Comparative, within-cohort reasoning and weighing evidence:
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s strongest predictors of PSS (severe GAD-7, low self-efficacy, high pain scores) have larger effect sizes within their cohort and/or stronger correlations with PSS (e.g., anxiety r ≈ 0.75, NGSE r ≈ -0.61) than the primary predictors for Participant 2 (circadian irregularity and sleep variability with smaller correlations, e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11, IV r ≈ +0.16, and STAI r ≈ +0.31).
- Extremity of scores: Participant 1 shows several large Zs on high-impact psychological measures (anxiety +1.51, self-efficacy -1.73, pain +1.4–1.6) and marked nocturnal physiological arousal (hourly HR deviation Zs > +2). Participant 2 has some extreme Zs (napping +3.05, interdaily stability -1.98), but those feature types (napping, circadian fragmentation) have smaller associations with PSS in these samples than anxiety, self-efficacy, and pain do for Participant 1.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s very strong symptom-domain signals (especially severe anxiety) plus corroborating nocturnal physiology argue for a higher PSS relative to their cohort mean than Participant 2’s profile, which is driven mainly by sleep/circadian irregularity plus modest trait anxiety but also has protective low resting HR and low substance use.

- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43), which have moderate positive correlations with PSS and likely increase perceived stress through functional impact.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: notable late-night/early-morning heart‑rate elevations and reduced circadian amplitude/24‑h autocorrelation — physiological markers that in the sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Convergence of multiple moderately-to-strongly PSS-related signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal HR) across domains increases probability of above-mean PSS despite some protective features.
- Counterpoints that mitigate but do not eliminate risk: low GAD-7 (strongly inversely correlated with PSS), high self‑efficacy, and low emotional lability — these reduce certainty but did not outweigh the large sleep/pain/physiology signals in the provided inference.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) despite adequate sleep duration; subjective sleep problems tend to elevate perceived stress.
- Late sleep timing (median start ~01:26 AM) plus modestly elevated nap rate, which weakly correlate with higher PSS in the sample and can reflect evening arousal or compensatory sleep.
- Marked evening heart‑rate elevation (e.g., large Z at 6–7 PM), which could reflect sustained arousal or activity that contributes to stress.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.20), which can contribute to higher perceived stress though correlations here are weak.
- Overall these are relatively modest risk signals in magnitude and correlation.

Comparative within-sample reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Direction relative to each study mean: Participant 1’s profile was explicitly interpreted as “above the population mean” (mean PSS = 21.21); Participant 2’s profile was explicitly interpreted as “below the population mean” (mean PSS = 21.63). Use these within-sample frames as the primary reference.
- Magnitude and convergence: Participant 1 shows several large, convergent risk indicators (extremely short objective sleep, very poor subjective sleep, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations). Those features are either large in magnitude or have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS and co-occur, increasing likelihood of a higher PSS relative to that study’s mean.
- Participant 2’s risk indicators are present but milder: subjective sleep disturbance and evening HR are notable but less extreme, and their associations with PSS in the sample are weaker.
- Protective signals: Participant 1 has important protective self-report signals (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy) that lower overall certainty, but these did not fully offset the strong sleep/pain/physiology abnormalities in the provided assessment. Participant 2 has multiple strong protective signals (very low depression and trait anxiety, high self-esteem/happiness, robust circadian amplitude, low resting HR, social time) that collectively point toward below-mean PSS with greater confidence.
- Net judgment: The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have higher perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 2 is relative to theirs. Participant 1’s severe sleep restriction and elevated pain plus nocturnal physiological activation are stronger and more convergent risk factors than Participant 2’s relatively modest sleep complaints and evening HR elevations, especially given Participant 2’s robust protective profile.

- Pronounced evening heart‑rate elevation (6–7 PM deviation Z ≈ 2.62) — evening autonomic activation can reflect sustained arousal and is modestly positively correlated with PSS.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z = -1.20) — a weaker correlate but could contribute to higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) with a moderate sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- Severe objective sleep restriction (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 27 min) and high sleep‑duration variability (SD = 197 min) — very short sleep duration is a potent stressor and functional risk.
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity rhythm (Z = 2.29; r with PSS ≈ 0.24) indicating circadian fragmentation associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale Z = 0.94) — an additional psychosocial stressor (though its correlation with PSS is small in the sample).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participant summaries conclude that overall inferred PSS is below their respective study mean. However, we must compare relative risk signals across profiles.
- Participant 1: multiple strong protective indicators with sizable Zs and known relationships to lower PSS — very low depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = -1.38), very low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.81), high self‑esteem/happiness (Zs ≈ 1.64–1.66), strong circadian amplitude/stability (amplitude Z = 1.78, interdaily stability Z = 1.0), and low resting HR. These are robust, convergent signals pointing to lower perceived stress.
- Participant 1’s counters-to-low-stress are present but comparatively smaller or weaker: PSQI = 7 (mildly disturbed), late timing, and evening HR elevation. Correlations for these features with PSS are modest in the sample.
- Participant 2: a mixed profile. Strong predictors of lower PSS are present (low GAD‑7, Z ≈ -0.94 with GAD‑7 having a strong sample correlation with PSS r ≈ 0.76; high NGSE with r ≈ -0.65; very low emotional lability). These point to lower perceived stress. However, Participant 2’s objective sleep restriction (3.5 h/night) and high circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = 2.29) are extreme and clinically meaningful; PSQI = 10 further supports substantial subjective sleep disturbance. These sleep/circadian signals are sizable and are established contributors to elevated perceived stress.
- Weighting evidence: Participant 1’s profile contains multiple strong, concordant protective indicators and only moderate risk signals. Participant 2’s profile is more conflicted: strong psychosocial/protective indicators (esp. low anxiety and high self‑efficacy) but very severe sleep deprivation and fragmentation that are likely to increase perceived stress relative to someone without such severe sleep loss.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher PSS)
- Although both participants are inferred to be below their respective study mean PSS, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit higher perceived stress than Participant 1, primarily because of the severity of objective and subjective sleep disturbance and circadian fragmentation in Participant 2, which outweighs some protective signals when compared to Participant 1’s consistently low symptom and strong circadian/psychosocial profile.

- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83). Subjective sleep problems are strongly associated with higher PSS and this is the single largest deviation from the sample mean in this profile.
- Marked depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 2.05). Depression score is well above average and depression correlates positively with PSS in this sample.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.56) and modest physiological arousal (resting HR Z = 0.65; intradaily variability Z = 0.81). These add convergent evidence of internal distress and arousal linked to PSS.
- Lower happiness and below‑average self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −0.31) that align with higher perceived stress.

Stress‑reducing / offsetting features noted (reduce but do not erase risk)
- Long, consistent objective sleep duration (median ≈ 8h10m, Z = 1.22; duration SD Z = −0.92).
- Regular exercise (Z ≈ 1.07), moderate social time (Z ≈ 0.95), low substance use, high music engagement (Z = 2.06).
Overall implication: multiple high‑impact risk signals (especially PSQI and CES‑D) point to above‑mean PSS, likely moderately elevated.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12, Z ≈ 0.46) with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.77). Even a modest Z on this measure maps strongly onto PSS in this sample.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5, Z = 1.32), which correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (hourly deviations Z ≈ 0.7–1.0) that correlate positively with PSS, suggesting autonomic arousal overnight and disrupted recovery.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.25) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ −0.66), which tends to increase perceived stress.
- BASIS‑24 emotional lability aligns with higher PSS (high correlation), and substance‑abuse subscale is elevated relative to the sample (Z = 1.5) though that subscale’s direct correlation with PSS here is negligible.

Stress‑reducing / offsetting features (moderate)
- Objective sleep duration slightly above median (≈7h19m, Z ≈ 0.66) and low variability.
- Lower resting HR (Z ≈ −0.64), preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation (Zs positive), and lower pain/physical‑activity interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS Z ≈ −1.1) — these are associated with lower PSS or resilience.

Comparative weighing (within‑sample framing)
- Both participants are judged above their respective sample means. Key difference is the magnitude and predictive weight of their aberrant measures.
- Participant 1 shows very large deviations on two high‑relevance measures: PSQI Z = 3.83 (very large) and CES‑D Z = 2.05. Although the sample correlations for depression and some physiological markers are modest, the sheer magnitude of these Z‑scores implies a substantial expected increase in PSS relative to the Participant 1 sample mean.
- Participant 2’s most predictive measures have strong correlations with PSS (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ −0.66), but the Z‑scores for those measures are more modest (GAD‑7 Z ≈ 0.46; NGSE Z ≈ −0.25). PSQI is elevated (Z ≈ 1.32) and nocturnal HR deviations are notable, but overall the standardized deviations appear smaller than Participant 1’s largest deviations.
- Put differently: P2’s pattern contains high‑impact predictors with modest magnitude; P1’s pattern contains very large magnitude deviations on multiple relevant measures (especially PSQI and CES‑D) even if some individual correlations are only moderate. Protective signals in both profiles temper the estimates, but P1’s extreme subjective sleep disturbance plus high depressive symptoms tip the balance toward a larger net elevation above that participant’s population mean.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of evidence (magnitude of Z‑scores on high‑relevance measures and convergent physiological/psychological signals), Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

3,78657,13,17,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Objective and subjective sleep/circadian disturbance: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), very late median sleep onset (~03:38), elevated night-to-night variability (sleep start SD z = 0.88), reduced interdaily stability (z = -0.82), and increased intradaily variability (z = 0.88). These circadian/sleep markers are each modestly positively correlated with PSS in this dataset (e.g., sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16).
- Elevated evening physiological arousal: large positive evening HR deviations (7–8 pm deviation z ≈ 1.53), consistent with stress-related arousal.
- Low health satisfaction (z = -1.53) and below-average momentary happiness (z ≈ -0.53), which co-occur with higher perceived stress in the sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Substantially disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically meaningful); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), so this is a nontrivial risk factor.
- Pain/interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS values indicate pain-related burden; these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54 (reduced social support or relationship difficulties), a plausible contributor to stress in this individual.
- Elevated basal physiology: mesor and resting HR both above mean (z ≈ 1.16 and 1.22), which can reflect higher autonomic arousal (though correlations with PSS are weak).

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Strength of associations: For Participant 2, the strongest dataset-level predictors of PSS mentioned are GAD-7 (r ≈ 0.77) and NGSE (r ≈ -0.63). Participant 2 has high NGSE (Z ≈ 1.41), a strong protective factor that in this sample is tightly linked to lower PSS and appears to substantially offset their sleep- and pain-related risks. Circadian regularity and low emotional lability are additional pronounced protective features for Participant 2.
- For Participant 1, the principal risk signals are circadian/sleep irregularity and evening arousal, but the noted correlations of those features with PSS are relatively small (r ≈ 0.16–0.18). Participant 1 also shows several protective markers (below-mean trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, good self-esteem, regular exercise and socializing, lower resting HR).
- Net balance: Participant 2 carries some moderately strong risk factors (high PSQI, pain), but also carries one of the strongest protective factors in the dataset (high NGSE with a large negative correlation with PSS) plus very robust behavioral regularity. Participant 1’s risks are centered on circadian/sleep dysregulation and evening arousal, but those relations to PSS are weaker in the sample and Participant 1 has several other protective indicators (low trait anxiety/depression, strong exercise/social habits).

Conclusion
- Given the relative magnitudes of predictors and the summaries’ own integrated judgments (Participant 1 interpreted as near/slightly above their mean; Participant 2 interpreted as near/slightly below their mean), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (relative to their respective study means).

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 29, Z = 1.63) and mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46), both of which correlate positively with PSS in this sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Marked sleep/timing disruption: extremely late median sleep onset (~03:45 AM), long but highly variable sleep duration (SD = 173 min, Z = 1.65), and PSQI just above cutoff (PSQI = 6). Sleep variability and disturbance are associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian irregularity: low 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.19, Z = -1.12) and modest interdaily stability, which are linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Large late‑afternoon/evening heart‑rate surge (5–6 pm deviation Z = 2.76) suggesting episodes of physiological arousal that may relate to stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Moderately elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12, Z = 0.46) with a very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a primary predictor of perceived stress here.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, Z = 1.32) that also correlates substantially with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight heart‑rate deviations above mesor (e.g., 12–1am Z ≈ 1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (~0.22–0.39), suggesting impaired nighttime recovery.
- High emotional lability (BASIS‑24) which strongly correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.68) and reduced self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.25) with strong negative association to PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Elevated substance‑abuse score (Z = 1.5) indicating behavioral risk factors that may compound stress vulnerability.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means, but the strength and directness of the predictors differ. Participant 1 shows notable affective symptoms (high CES‑D) and marked circadian/sleep timing disruption; however, those predictors have only small‑to‑moderate correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 1 also has several clear protective signals (low substance use, low resting HR, frequent social exercise, modestly higher happiness/health satisfaction) that temper the net stress inference.
- Participant 2 presents multiple high‑impact indicators that are tightly coupled to PSS in that population: GAD‑7 (very high correlation with PSS), extremely poor subjective sleep quality, nighttime HR elevations, and high emotional lability. Although Participant 2 has some protective objective signs (adequate average sleep duration, lower resting HR, preserved circadian autocorrelation), the strongest predictors for PSS in that sample are elevated and convergent for Participant 2.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s largest z signals (CES‑D Z = 1.63, sleep‑variability Z = 1.65, HR‑spike Z = 2.76) are notable but their predictive weights for PSS are modest in that study. Participant 2’s elevations (PSQI Z = 1.32, nocturnal HR deviations Z ≈ 1.0, GAD‑7 predictive power high) map onto measures with stronger sample‑level correlations to PSS, implying a larger expected effect on perceived stress.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 demonstrates a more direct and convergent set of high‑impact predictors (anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, nocturnal autonomic arousal, emotional lability) that — given their strong correlations with PSS in that study — point to a higher perceived stress relative to their population mean than Participant 1’s profile does relative to theirs.
- Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Sleep disturbance and irregularity: PSQI >5, late median sleep onset (~01:44), high night-to-night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 1.32). Sleep disruption is positively associated with PSS (sleep variability r ≈ 0.13).  
- Reduced circadian regularity: lower interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, low 24-h autocorrelation (Zs negative) — patterns associated with elevated stress/mood problems.  
- Social/health vulnerability signals: low trust (Z ≈ -1.74) and lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95) that can contribute to perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean):
- Very high generalized anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ 1.51) and the GAD-7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74). This is the single strongest predictor in the available data.  
- Severe subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 18.5 (Z ≈ 1.65) and PSQI correlates substantially with PSS (r = 0.43).  
- High emotional lability and pain/interference: BASIS-24 emotional lability Z ≈ 1.03 (r with PSS ≈ 0.63); PEG-3 and PAPAS elevated — all positively related to PSS.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44) where NGSE correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ -0.66), indicating reduced coping resources.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning:
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective cohort means. The key distinction is magnitude and predictive strength of the indicators within each cohort.  
- Participant 1’s strongest psychosocial predictors (CES-D, STAI) are moderately elevated but have only modest correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Several wearable/circadian markers also point to stress but with smaller sample effect sizes. Protective factors (high self-esteem, regular exercise, low RHR) are present and moderate. The summary characterizes P1’s likely PSS as above the mean but “a moderate upward deviation.”  
- Participant 2 shows very large subjective elevations with much stronger sample-level correlations to PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.74; emotional lability r ≈ 0.63; NGSE r ≈ -0.66). Those subjective signals are severe (Zs ~1.5–1.65) and carry larger effect sizes for predicting PSS. Although objective physiology for P2 is comparatively organized (which is protective), the subjective measures that most strongly predict PSS are substantially larger and more predictive than Participant 1’s strongest indicators.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Because Participant 2’s elevated measures are both larger in magnitude (higher Zs) and have much stronger sample correlations with PSS, the expected deviation above their cohort mean is likely larger than Participant 1’s expected deviation above theirs. Participant 1 appears above mean but by a more moderate degree, with more protective factors offsetting some risk signals. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Sleep disturbance and variability: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), very late median sleep onset (~01:44), and high night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +1.32). Sleep disruption and variability are associated with higher PSS in this sample.  
- Reduced circadian robustness: Lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.57), reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −0.52), and low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.70) — patterns that conceptually and empirically align with higher stress.  
- Low social trust and modestly low health satisfaction (Zs ≈ −1.74 and −0.95), which can increase vulnerability to perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not have very high PSS (protective factors)
- Very high self-esteem (39/40) and above-average current happiness (Z ≈ +0.55), both negatively correlated with PSS in the sample.  
- Regular exercise (Z ≈ +1.07) and low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.61), which are plausibly stress-buffering.  
- Evening physiological activation pattern that, in this dataset, is modestly associated with lower PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean = 20.75)
- Strongly predictive self-report burdens: GAD-7 = 7.5 (mild anxiety) and Emotional Lability = 6.33; these scales have very strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.80; Emotional Lability r ≈ 0.67).  
- Poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 9 (strongly associated with PSS in this dataset; PSQI r ≈ 0.59).  
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55; both positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).  
- Nighttime heart-rate deviations at several late-night hours that are positively correlated with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.45), suggesting nocturnal autonomic arousal linked to stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have very high PSS (protective factors)
- Robust circadian physiology and daytime consolidation: amplitude Z ≈ +0.95 and 24-h autocorr Z ≈ +0.91 (both negatively correlated with PSS), strong daytime HR peaks negatively correlated with PSS, infrequent napping (Z ≈ −1.02). These wearable-derived features are associated with lower perceived stress in the study and likely moderate subjective burdens.  
- Long objective sleep opportunity (median sleep ≈ 10 h 11 min, Z ≈ +1.64) and self-efficacy near sample mean (NGSE ≈ 30), which may be mitigating.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame and weighing evidence
- Both participants are assessed as likely above their respective population means in their summaries. The critical question is which participant appears more elevated relative to peers.  
- For Participant 1 the strongest indicators of higher PSS are clinically notable depressive and trait-anxiety scores plus disrupted, irregular sleep and weakened circadian rhythm. However, the study correlations tying those specific measures to PSS are modest (CES-D/STAI correlations with PSS ≈ 0.28–0.31; sleep variability r ≈ 0.13). Participant 1 also has several substantial protective signals (very high self-esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR) that likely attenuate the net elevation, and the summary characterizes the likely deviation as a “moderate upward deviation” from mean.  
- For Participant 2 the self-report predictors that point toward higher PSS (GAD-7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain) have much stronger empirical associations with PSS in that sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.80; emotional lability r ≈ 0.67; PSQI r ≈ 0.59). Though wearable physiology is protective and likely reduces how extreme the elevation is, the highest-weight predictors (by correlation with PSS) are concentrated in Participant 2’s profile and coherently indicate elevated perceived stress across multiple high-weight domains.

Overall judgment
- Because Participant 2’s elevated domains are those that, in their study population, show substantially stronger correlations with PSS (i.e., the survey measures with large r values), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely exhibiting the higher overall perceived stress (a larger upward deviation from their population mean) than Participant 1.

3,79167,13,10,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1's population mean = 21.38)
- Clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), making poor perceived sleep a likely stress risk.
- Pain/interference scores (PEG-3 ≈ 4.9; PAPAS ~50) are above median and these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47), suggesting pain-related burden that can elevate stress.
- Interpersonal strain is elevated (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which could reduce perceived social support and increase stress for this individual.
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22) that may reflect higher basal autonomic arousal (though correlations with PSS are weak).
- Although anxiety is only mild (GAD-7 = 5.5), PSS correlates strongly with anxiety in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77), so any anxiety contributes to risk.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (to acknowledge balance)
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.41) which strongly inversely correlates with PSS (r ≈ −0.63) — a robust protective factor.
- Strong circadian/behavioral regularity (very high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, strong 24‑h autocorrelation) and long objective sleep duration (median ~9 h 41 m), both generally protective.
- Low emotional lability (Z = −0.67) and minimal substance problems (Z = −1.62), both of which reduce stress risk.
- The integrated interpretation in the summary leans to near-or-slightly-below-mean PSS for this participant.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2's population mean = 21.65)
- Wearable circadian indices show reduced regularity and greater fragmentation (interdaily stability Z = −1.07; autocorrelation Z = −0.87; intradaily variability Z = 0.74; amplitude Z = −1.03), and these features modestly correlate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated early-morning heart-rate peak (Z = 3.07) and some morning HR deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.14–0.23), possibly reflecting transient arousal or schedule-related stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS
- Strong, consistent self-report protection: very low trait anxiety (STAI Z = −1.71), low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = −1.07), high happiness and health satisfaction (Zs 1.64 and 2.05), and elevated self-esteem (Z = 1.24) — these directly index lower perceived stress.
- Good subjective and objective sleep (PSQI = 5, Z = −0.8; median sleep 8 h 11 m, Z = 1.25).
- Healthy behaviors (frequent exercise, low substance use, low sedentary/screen time) and lower resting HR/mesor (Zs ≈ −0.65 and −0.81), consistent with lower tonic arousal and higher fitness.
- The integrated interpretation in the summary favors below-mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Both participant summaries explicitly conclude Participant 2 is below their study mean and Participant 1 is near or slightly below their study mean. However, Participant 1 has several moderate risk signals (poor subjective sleep, pain interference, interpersonal strain, elevated resting HR) that push toward higher perceived stress, even though protective factors are strong.
- Participant 2’s dominant signal is robustly low self-report anxiety/depression and good subjective sleep and wellbeing — stronger, directly stress-related protective indicators than the mainly physiological/circadian risk signals noted for Participant 2. The circadian/fragmentation signals that argue for higher PSS in Participant 2 are of smaller effect and less consistent with the strong self-report protection.
- Therefore, when comparing the two within their respective population contexts, Participant 1 presents a greater balance of stress-related risk factors relative to their population than Participant 2 does relative to theirs. Participant 2’s profile is more clearly and consistently oriented toward lower perceived stress.

- Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.81) indicating more fragmentation of rest/activity across the day; this metric has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.17).
- Moderately reduced circadian rigidity (lower 24-h autocorrelation, interdaily stability marginal), which can reflect day‑to‑day variability associated with stress.
- Large evening heart‑rate elevation (5–6 PM deviation, Z ≈ 4.19) and broadly elevated evening HR that — if not solely attributable to exercise — could reflect sustained physiological arousal with small sample correlations to PSS.
- Small positive correlations for some nighttime-to-morning HR deviations with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5), which correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 m) and large variability in sleep timing (sleep-start SD ≈ 123 min), both linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Substantial nocturnal heart‑rate elevations around midnight–2 AM (e.g., 1–2 AM +14.62 bpm) with the 1–2 AM deviation showing a moderately strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- These sleep/nocturnal-arousal indicators are strong risk signals for higher PSS in this participant’s study frame, even though other measures are protective.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighting of evidence
- Participant 1’s profile is broadly and consistently indicative of below‑mean stress relative to their population: multiple strong protective signals (very low depression, below‑average trait anxiety, high momentary happiness, good PSQI, regular exercise, low resting HR, stable/adequate sleep) outweigh the few small stress‑related signals (intradaily variability, evening HR likely due to exercise). Most of the individual features that predict PSS in their sample are either neutral or protective for Participant 1.
- Participant 2’s profile is mixed: trait measures and daytime physiology are strongly protective (very low GAD‑7 with a large correlation to PSS, relatively high self‑efficacy with large negative correlation to PSS, low RHR, strong interdaily stability), but the sleep-related indicators are severe (very short objective sleep, high PSQI, irregular timing, and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations) and each has moderate correlations with PSS. The sleep signals are substantial and plausibly elevate perceived stress even if daytime trait measures suggest low anxiety.
- Direct comparison: Participant 1 shows consistently low-stress indicators across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains with only modest countersignals. Participant 2 has a key cluster of severe sleep-related disturbances and nocturnal arousal that are known to raise perceived stress and are objectively large (e.g., ~4.3 hours sleep median, PSQI >10, sizable overnight HR elevations). Even though Participant 2 has strong protective daytime trait markers, the magnitude and number of sleep/nocturnal-risk signals are enough to place their overall inferred PSS higher than Participant 1’s, when reasoning within each participant’s study frame.

- Elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.81), which in this sample has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.17) and indicates more day–night fragmentation.
- Moderately reduced circadian regularity (low 24-h autocorrelation, interdaily stability only moderate), which can accompany situational routine variability or stress.
- Large evening heart-rate deviations (5–6 PM, Z = 4.19) and elevated evening HR more broadly; certain hourly HR elevations show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (though the profile likely reflects exercise rather than distress in this case).
- Small positive correlations between some nighttime-to-morning HR deviations and PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.46).
- Very short objective nightly sleep (median 3 h 27 m) and elevated night-to-night sleep variability—objectively extreme sleep restriction is a potent stressor even if some Z-scores are moderated by sample variance.
- High intradaily variability (Z = 2.29), which in this sample correlates with higher PSS (r = 0.24) and indicates pronounced rest–activity fragmentation.
- Increased daytime napping and an elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal), which could add psychosocial stress.

Comparative framing and weighing of evidence
- Participant 1: Multiple, relatively strong protective indicators (very low CES-D and STAI ≈ −1 SD each, PSQI well below clinical cutoff, high happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, stable/adequate sleep duration and low variability, pronounced nocturnal HR declines) point cohesively toward PSS below their study mean (mean = 21.63, SD = 3.67). The signals that push toward higher stress are present but generally small-to-moderate in magnitude or plausibly attributable to healthy behaviors (e.g., evening HR spikes from exercise).
- Participant 2: The profile is mixed. Strong protective predictors in this sample (very low GAD-7, relatively high NGSE, very low emotional lability) point toward lower PSS and these predictors have large sample-level associations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ −0.65). However, the participant also shows severe sleep pathology (both subjective disturbance and extremely short objective sleep) and substantial circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = 2.29). Sleep measures here are moderately associated with higher PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.46) and very short sleep is clinically meaningful as a stressor. Overall the profile was judged in the source summary to ""lean toward lower perceived stress"" but noted important sleep-related risk factors that could elevate stress.

Final judgment
- Participant 1’s data present a coherent, multi-domain pattern strongly indicating below-mean perceived stress with only modest countervailing signals.
- Participant 2’s data are more conflicted: several very strong protective indicators (especially low GAD-7 and high NGSE) but also pronounced objective and subjective sleep disturbance and marked circadian fragmentation—features that more strongly and directly elevate perceived stress than Participant 1’s modest stress signals.

Considering the balance of risk signals that raise perceived stress, Participant 2 carries the more pronounced stress-related liabilities (severe sleep restriction and high circadian fragmentation) compared with Participant 1’s largely protective profile. Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress) relative to their respective study population.

- Disturbed subjective sleep and sleep instability: PSQI = 8 (z ≈ +0.59), late sleep timing and large night‑to‑night variability, and high nap frequency (z ≈ +2.27) — sleep disturbance commonly elevates perceived stress.
- Marked circadian/physiological dysregulation: low circadian amplitude (z ≈ −1.48), low interdaily stability (z ≈ −1.40), and large evening HR elevations (8–9pm HR deviation z ≈ +1.85) — these indicate disrupted recovery/tonic arousal that aligns with higher stress.
- Low self‑rated happiness (z ≈ −1.61) and behavioral patterns (reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use) consistent with higher stress exposure.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD‑7 = 12 (z ≈ +0.46) with a very strong correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a potent predictor despite modest z.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 17.5 (z ≈ +1.32), with a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight HR deviations above the mesor (largest z ≈ +1.02), and these nocturnal HR elevations have positive correlations with PSS.
- Lower self‑efficacy and emotional lability: NGSE below average and BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability strongly associated with PSS (correlation ≈ 0.68).
- Additional concerns: elevated substance‑use subscale (z ≈ +1.5), which is a notable deviation within that sample.

Comparative reasoning within each sample frame
- Magnitude of deviations: Participant 1 exhibits several large-magnitude deviations (CES‑D z ≈ +1.42; circadian amplitude/interdaily stability z ≈ −1.4 to −1.5; evening HR z ≈ +1.85; naps z ≈ +2.27; happiness z ≈ −1.61). Participant 2 shows a few moderately large deviations (PSQI z ≈ +1.32; substance z ≈ +1.5; nocturnal HR z up to ≈ +1.02) but many signals are smaller or protective (resting HR lower, amplitude and autocorrelation neutral-to-positive).
- Predictor strength (correlations): Participant 2’s GAD‑7 has a very strong relationship to PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.77), making a modest GAD z meaningful. Participant 1’s strongest self‑report predictors (CES‑D, STAI) have more modest correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), but their z‑scores (especially CES‑D) are larger. In short: P2 has a high‑leverage predictor at modest elevation; P1 has multiple moderate/large elevations across several domains.
- Convergence and breadth: Participant 1 shows convergence across mood, sleep timing/variability, circadian dysregulation, and elevated evening physiological arousal — a broad, multi‑domain pattern of dysregulation. Participant 2’s elevated predictors are concentrated in anxiety, subjective sleep quality, and nocturnal HR, but are partially offset by objectively adequate sleep duration and lower resting HR.

Overall assessment
Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but Participant 1 displays a broader and more extreme set of deviations across mood, circadian stability, sleep fragmentation (including very high nap frequency), and evening autonomic arousal. Although Participant 2 has a very predictive anxiety measure (high GAD‑7→PSS correlation) and very poor PSQI, the overall magnitude and multi‑domain dysregulation in Participant 1 (several z’s > |1.4| and some > |1.8–2.2|) suggest a larger elevation of perceived stress relative to that participant’s population mean, and likely a greater absolute perceived stress burden than Participant 2 relative to their mean.

- Several objective wearable markers (higher interdaily stability, lower intradaily variability, low resting heart rate and mesor, clear amplitude and acrophase) are associated with lower PSS in the cohort and therefore provide resilience signals that partially counter subjective risk. However, these physiological signals have smaller predictive weight in the provided interpretation compared with the strong subjective measures.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.59)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 21; Z = 0.8) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z = 0.86). Both are established correlates of higher PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Low self-esteem (RSES Z = −1.29), a trait that modestly increases risk for higher PSS.
- Circadian/behavioral disruption: high intradaily variability (Z = 1.09), reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), notable variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 99 min), and somewhat short median sleep (6 h 46 min; Z ≈ −0.52). These features are positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Marginally disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6), which tends to co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Notes on mitigating evidence for Participant 2:
- Strong protective behaviors and physiology: frequent exercise (Zs ≈ 1.07–1.58), absence of substance use, relatively low resting heart rate (Z ≈ −0.42), and modestly elevated happiness (Z ≈ 0.55). These features are associated with lower PSS and likely moderate symptom-related risk.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength of predictors: Participant 1 shows very large elevations on measures that are highly predictive of PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74 and PSQI r = 0.43), with Z-scores >1.5 on at least two of those (GAD-7 Z = 1.51; PSQI Z = 1.65). Participant 2’s symptom elevations are more moderate (CES-D and STAI Z ≈ 0.8) and the symptom measures available for Participant 2 have smaller correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
- Quantity and magnitude of risk vs protective signals: Both participants have a mix of risk and protective signals, but Participant 1’s risk signals are more extreme in magnitude and tied to stronger PSS predictors. Participant 2 has notable circadian fragmentation (a risk signal) but also strong behavioral protections (regular exercise, no substance use) that are described as materially mitigating.
- Direction and certainty of conclusions in the summaries: Both summaries conclude the participant is likely above their population mean. However, Participant 1’s narrative emphasizes very large subjective symptom elevations that “carry greater weight for perceived stress” despite physiologic resilience. Participant 2’s narrative describes a “moderate elevation” in perceived stress that is plausibly offset to some degree by protective behaviors.

Overall balance of evidence
- Because Participant 1 has larger-magnitude elevations on the most predictive self-report correlates of PSS in that sample (notably severe anxiety and extremely poor subjective sleep), and because those measures have higher correlations with PSS than the main elevated measures in Participant 2, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

4,18111,31,28,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES-D = 27 (z ≈ +1.42, “Depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 48 (z ≈ +0.66) — both above the cohort mean and positively correlated with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance and irregular timing: PSQI = 8 (z ≈ +0.59), late median sleep onset (~01:19), high night-to-night sleep variability (SD ≈ 113 min), and high nap frequency (z ≈ +2.27) — sleep problems that commonly elevate perceived stress.
- Blunted/irregular circadian physiology and evening physiological arousal: low circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.48), low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.40), and pronounced evening HR elevation (8–9pm deviation z ≈ +1.85) — objective rhythm disruptions associated with poorer mood/stress.
- Behavioral correlates consistent with strain: reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use, and low self-rated happiness (z ≈ -1.61) that align with higher stress risk.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (z ≈ +1.51) with a strong sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.75) — one of the strongest single predictors of higher PSS in this dataset.
- Marked subjective sleep pathology and very short sleep duration: PSQI = 16 (z ≈ +0.83) and median sleep ≈ 4 h 55 min, plus late sleep onset (~01:42) — large contributors to perceived stress.
- High pain/interference and low self-efficacy: PEG-3 and PAPAS elevated (z ≈ +1.4–1.6), NGSE low (z ≈ -1.73) — each with moderate-to-strong correlations to PSS (e.g., NGSE r ≈ -0.61), indicating reduced coping capacity and higher stress.
- Nocturnal physiological hyperarousal: very large positive nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM z ≈ +2.83) that align with subjective symptoms and have modest positive correlations with PSS (e.g., 1–2 AM r ≈ 0.34).

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective study means. However, the strength and nature of the indicators differ:
  - Participant 2’s key symptom measures (severe GAD-7, extremely poor PSQI, high pain/interference, very low NGSE) show larger Z-scores and much stronger correlations with PSS (notably anxiety r ≈ 0.75 and self-efficacy r ≈ -0.61). Physiological evidence for P2 (very large nocturnal HR deviations, very short sleep) is also more extreme and temporally concordant with the self-report symptoms.
  - Participant 1 shows meaningful elevations (depression z ≈ +1.42, moderate anxiety, disturbed sleep) and objective circadian irregularities, but symptom-to-PSS correlations reported for those measures are more modest (CES-D/STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31) and several protective signals are present (adequate average sleep duration, normal resting HR, healthy BMI, preserved academic functioning).
- In short, although both are above their cohort means, Participant 2’s profile contains larger-magnitude symptom scores, stronger PSS-linked measures, and more extreme nocturnal physiological markers, while Participant 1 has milder-to-moderate symptom elevations and several buffering/neutral signs.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (larger effect sizes on symptom measures that are strongly predictive of PSS plus pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal and very short sleep).

9,93699,12,13,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (clinically meaningful disturbance), a predictor positively correlated with PSS in this sample.
- Elevated trait anxiety/negative affect: STAI–Trait = 44 (classified “anxious”) and lower self-rated happiness/health satisfaction — affective signals that align with higher PSS.
- Later, shorter, and more variable sleep timing: median sleep ~6 h 51 min and late sleep onset (~00:59) with substantial night-to-night variability — sleep timing/duration patterns associated with greater perceived stress.
- High evening/late-night internet use (>>4 hours, z ≈ +2.19) that can exacerbate sleep problems and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation: resting HR and mesor modestly above sample mean (z ≈ +0.7–0.8), consistent with low-to-moderate autonomic activation seen with higher stress.
- Holistic note: the study-level synthesis explicitly concluded this participant’s PSS is above the study mean (21.64), albeit modestly.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe subjective and objective sleep problems: PSQI = 10 (disturbed) and extremely short median nightly sleep (~3 h 27 min) with high sleep-duration variability and elevated naps — strong behavioral signs that often accompany higher stress.
- High intradaily variability (z ≈ +2.29), indicating fragmented rest–activity rhythms linked to higher PSS in the sample.
- Some interpersonal strain: elevated BASIS-24 interpersonal score (z ≈ +0.94) could add psychosocial stress.

Comparative weighting within each study’s frame
- Directional labels: Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes above-mean PSS (population mean 21.64). Participant 2’s summary explicitly concludes below-mean PSS (population mean 21.42). Weighing the specific predictors and their sample-level associations clarifies why.
- Strength of predictors: For Participant 2, the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (GAD-7, r = 0.76; NGSE inverse, r = -0.65) favor lower perceived stress because this participant has low GAD-7 (score 4) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE = 33). These are high-importance features in the dataset and strongly pull the PSS estimate down for Participant 2 despite very severe sleep restriction.
- For Participant 1, several moderate-strength indicators (clinically meaningful PSQI, trait anxiety, late/short sleep, high late-night internet use, modestly elevated resting HR) converge toward above-mean PSS. Though none are extreme, the combination produces a probabilistic elevation above the sample mean.
- Comparing the two: Participant 2’s most extreme problems are sleep-related, but in this sample the most predictive signals for PSS are anxiety and self-efficacy, which favor a below-mean PSS for Participant 2. Participant 1 carries multiple moderate risk signals (sleep disturbance, trait anxiety, elevated HR, late-night behavior) and the study-level conclusion places them above the mean. Taken in the context of which features have larger predictive weight (GAD-7 and NGSE especially), Participant 2’s low anxiety/high self-efficacy likely offset their sleep problems in predicting PSS, whereas Participant 1’s combination of affective, sleep, behavioral, and physiological signals yields a higher PSS estimate.

Overall determination
- Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 2.

15,33009,15,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to P1’s study population):
- Wearable circadian disruption: elevated intradaily variability (IV Z = +0.53), reduced interdaily stability (IS Z ≈ -0.49) and lower 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.45). In this dataset these features correlate with higher PSS (IV r ≈ +0.16; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; amplitude r ≈ -0.17).
- Lower circadian amplitude and lower mesor (Amplitude Z = -0.92; Mesor Z = -0.71), patterns associated with higher stress in this sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified “disturbed”), which is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 40, “anxious”) and reduced current happiness (Z = -0.53), both of which are consistent with increased psychological strain.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might NOT have much higher PSS (protective factors):
- Objective sleep duration is ample and consistent (median ≈ 7 h 54 min, Z = +0.89; night-to-night variability Z = -1.03).
- Low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 9, Z = -0.45), high self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z = +0.26), low substance use, reasonable social activity and strong academic performance — all associated with lower PSS.
- Resting HR unremarkable (Z ≈ 0).

Overall relative framing: The stress-related signals for P1 are present but modest in magnitude (many Zs near ±0.5 to 1.0) and the circadian/PSQI signals have small-to-moderate sample correlations with PSS; multiple protective indicators argue that P1’s PSS is likely only modestly above their population mean (the summary explicitly infers “somewhat above the population mean, within ~1 SD”).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to P2’s study population):
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5, Z = +0.67) and PSQI shows a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.53).
- High pain/functional impairment (PAPAS = 81, Z = +0.93), also strongly positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62); NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS in this sample (r = -0.69), so this is an important risk factor.
- Elevated nocturnal heart rate (12–3 AM deviations with Zs up to ≈ 1.38) and higher mesor/RHR (Mesor Z = +0.7; RHR Z = +0.61); nocturnal HR deviations have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (IS Z = -0.83), consistent with higher PSS in this dataset.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might NOT have extremely high PSS (protective factors):
- Low-to-mild generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 5, Z = -0.76), and low intradaily variability (IV Z = -1.28) which are associated with lower likelihood of extreme stress.
- Relatively long median nightly sleep (8 h 4 min, Z = +0.92) and low nap frequency (Z = -0.56).
- Emotional lability modestly below average (Z = -0.37).

Overall relative framing: The stress-related indicators for P2 are stronger and more numerous, and several of them have relatively large sample-level correlations with PSS (notably NGSE r = -0.69, PSQI/PAPAS r ≈ 0.53, nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.31–0.47). The summary explicitly infers P2’s PSS is above the population mean and likely moderately elevated.

Comparative weighing of evidence (within each study frame):
- Strength and number of positive stress indicators: Participant 2 has multiple robust indicators (very poor subjective sleep, high pain, low self‑efficacy, elevated nocturnal HR) that have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS. Participant 1’s positive indicators are mainly circadian fragmentation and mild subjective sleep disturbance; these features have smaller correlations with PSS in that sample and several strong protective factors counterbalance them.
- Magnitude of abnormality: P2 shows larger Z deviations on key variables (PAPAS Z ≈ +0.93, nocturnal HR Zs up to ≈ +1.38, NGSE Z ≈ -0.62) than P1 does on their stress-related variables (most Zs near ±0.5–1.0, amplitude Z = -0.92 but other circadian Zs smaller).
- Net inference communicated in each summary: Both summaries infer above-mean PSS, but P1 is characterized as “modestly elevated” and likely within ~1 SD above mean; P2 is characterized as “above the mean” with several strong converging signals implying a clearer elevation.

Conclusion:
On balance, Participant 2 presents a stronger, more coherent, and more highly correlated set of indicators pointing to elevated perceived stress relative to their study population. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), so poor perceived sleep is a plausible stress contributor.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3 ~4.9; PAPAS ~50). These measures are above the population median and correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = +1.54), which could reduce perceived social support (though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z ≈ +1.16 and +1.22), which may reflect higher basal autonomic arousal associated with stress in some individuals (weak correlation with PSS in this sample).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 24, Z ≈ +1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI trait = 49, Z ≈ +0.76). Both measures have positive correlations with PSS in the sample and are moderately elevated.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, Z ≈ +1.52) plus objectively short sleep (median ≈ 6 h, Z ≈ -1.45), very late sleep onset (~03:56) and high night-to-night start-time variability — a cluster strongly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -0.63) and some within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability slightly above mean), consistent with a stressed circadian/behavioral profile.
- Nocturnal/late-night heart‑rate elevation and behavioral inactivity (no regular exercise), both of which can co-occur with higher stress.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean PSS. Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes the participant is near or slightly below their population mean PSS: strong protective factors (high NGSE Z ≈ +1.41 with a strong inverse correlation to PSS, pronounced circadian/behavioral regularity with very large Z-scores, low emotional lability, little substance use, and long objective sleep duration) substantially offset the identified risks (PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain). The strongest single predictor relationships in that dataset (GAD-7 and NGSE) favor lower perceived stress for Participant 1.
- Participant 2’s summary explicitly concludes the participant is above their population mean PSS. Multiple convergent risk indicators (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, high PSQI, short/late/variable sleep, reduced circadian amplitude, nocturnal HR elevation, low exercise) produce a consistent signal toward elevated perceived stress; protective factors (no substance use, good GPA, some social/leisure time) are present but judged insufficient to outweigh the risk pattern.
- Comparing the balance of evidence: Participant 2 shows several moderately-large risk z-scores tied to constructs that correlate with PSS (e.g., PSQI Z ≈ +1.5; CES-D Z ≈ +1.1; objective sleep shortness Z ≈ -1.45), whereas Participant 1 shows notable risk features but also strong, highly relevant protective factors (notably NGSE Z ≈ +1.41 with a strong inverse relation to PSS and very high circadian regularity Zs). Thus the net evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to have a higher (worse) perceived stress score relative to their study mean than Participant 1 is relative to theirs.

- Objective sleep disturbance: short median nightly sleep (~6 h 5 m, Z ≈ -1.37) and very late sleep onset (~02:34).

- Depressive symptoms: CES‑D = 20 (Z ≈ +0.7), and CES‑D correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (~+0.29).  
- Behavioral risks reducing resilience: very low exercise, limited socializing, low physical health satisfaction, slightly elevated alcohol frequency.  
- These converging objective and self‑report signals (esp. strong circadian/autonomic deviations and sleep disturbance) were judged sufficient in the description to infer above‑mean PSS for this population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Extremely severe and irregular sleep: median sleep ≈ 3 h 4 m (objective), very large night‑to‑night sleep start variability (SD = 401 min, Z = 2.82), and very high PSQI = 13.5. PSQI and objective short/irregular sleep have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50).  
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9.0 (mild anxiety) with a very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78); BASIS‑24 emotional lability elevated (Z = 0.43, r ≈ 0.68 with PSS).  
- Substance‑related problems and pain interference: BASIS‑24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS—both plausibly increase perceived stress.  
- Circadian instability: reduced interdaily stability and amplitude (Zs ≈ -1.42 and -1.10), consistent with greater stress and poor sleep.  
- These measures that most strongly correlate with PSS in this dataset (GAD‑7, PSQI, emotional lability) are both large in magnitude and highly PSS‑linked, driving the inference of above‑mean PSS.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning:
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study population means for PSS. The critical comparison is the strength, extremity, and PSS‑relevance of the indicators in each description relative to their own sample.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are physiologic/circadian (large Zs for resting HR and circadian amplitude/stability). However, those physiologic metrics have relatively small correlations with PSS in the Participant 1 summary (resting HR correlation ~+0.15; circadian metrics unspecified but implied weaker/modest associations). Subjective sleep problems and depressive symptoms are present but moderate (PSQI = 7, CES‑D Z ≈ +0.7). Protective psychological traits (lower trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem, above‑average happiness) partially offset risk.
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple extremely severe and PSS‑relevant signals that, in this study, show strong correlations with PSS: objectively and subjectively extreme sleep deprivation/irregularity (median ~3 h, PSQI 13.5, sleep timing SD Z = +2.82), high anxiety symptoms with very strong PSS correlation (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78), elevated emotional lability (r ≈ 0.68), and substance‑related problems. Although Participant 2 has a robust protective factor (very high self‑efficacy, NGSE Z = +1.79, r ≈ -0.63), the largest and most PSS‑predictive measures (severe sleep disruption, anxiety, affective instability, substance issues) are extreme and strongly weighted toward higher perceived stress.
- In short, Participant 1 shows pronounced physiological dysregulation that suggests elevated stress relative to their peers, but many of those physiologic markers are less strongly correlated with PSS in the sample and some psychological protections are present. Participant 2 shows extreme, highly PSS‑correlated psychological and behavioral disturbances (especially sleep and anxiety) that are both large in magnitude and tied to strong sample correlations with PSS.

Balance of evidence and determination:
- Given the magnitude and the strength of association with PSS of Participant 2’s top indicators (particularly severe objective/subjective sleep deprivation and high anxiety with strong sample correlations), Participant 2’s profile provides a stronger signal of higher perceived stress relative to their population mean than Participant 1’s profile does relative to theirs.
- Therefore, Participant 2 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; z = +0.67). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ +0.53), so elevated PSQI pushes toward above-mean PSS.
- Very short median wearable sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD z ≈ +0.89) and sleep onset time (SD z ≈ +0.34). Short, irregular sleep commonly accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low autocorrelation at 24 h, reduced cosinor amplitude), which often co-occur with elevated perceived stress and disrupted behavioral structure.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = +2.34), a contextual risk factor that plausibly increases ongoing perceived stress even if it has only a weak sample-level correlation with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 27; z ≈ +1.42) and trait anxiety (STAI-T = 56; z ≈ +1.45). Both have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ +0.29 and +0.32) and are described as the most salient predictors of higher PSS for this participant.
- Mild subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; z ≈ +0.13), which is associated with higher stress.
- Small physiological signs of elevated arousal (slightly elevated MESOR, evening heart-rate deviations), consistent with modestly greater physiological activation linked to stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Magnitude of affective risk: Participant 2 shows relatively large affective elevations (CES-D and STAI z ≈ +1.4 each). These are substantial, concordant signals that—by the study authors’ account—are the primary drivers of higher inferred PSS in that cohort.
- Magnitude and nature of Participant 1 risk: Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are severe sleep disturbance (very short sleep, high variability, PSQI elevated) and high interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = +2.34). Sleep complaints here have a strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r ≈ +0.53), which increases the relevance of Participant 1’s sleep problems. However, many other markers for Participant 1 point away from high perceived stress: minimal anxiety (GAD-7 z ≈ −1.38), low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy (and self-efficacy correlates strongly with lower PSS, r ≈ −0.66), and lower resting HR/MESOR.
- Protective vs. risk balance: Participant 1’s profile is mixed but characterized in the summary as “near the mean with a modest tilt toward being above the mean.” Their high sleep disruption and interpersonal strain are important risk factors but are counterbalanced by strong protective signals (low anxiety, good self-efficacy, low pain). Participant 2’s profile is also mixed, but the summary frames the elevated depression and trait anxiety as the dominant contributors that outweigh protective circadian regularity and healthy behaviors—leading to an inferred above-mean PSS.
- Relative strength of evidence: Although Participant 1 has very severe objective sleep deficits (extremely short median sleep), several strongly protective psychosocial indicators for P1 (notably very low anxiety and high-effective coping/self-efficacy) are present and associated with PSS in this cohort. Participant 2 lacks those protective psychosocial signals and instead has multiple moderately large affective elevations that the report explicitly identifies as primary predictors of greater perceived stress.

Weighing the total balance of evidence
- Participant 2 presents with multiple, concordant affective risk indicators (depression and trait anxiety both ≈ +1.4 SD above their sample mean) that the report treats as the main basis for inferring above-mean perceived stress. Those affective elevations are direct psychological predictors of PSS and are not offset by similarly strong protective psychosocial signals.
- Participant 1 has important risk indicators (very poor and irregular sleep, interpersonal strain) but also several substantive protective signals (very low anxiety, low pain, near-average or better self-efficacy, lower resting HR). The original summary concludes P1 is likely near the population mean, only modestly above it if at all.
- Given both summaries and the relative magnitudes of affective elevations versus protections, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their population mean).

- Very short objective sleep: median ~4 h 21 min and large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min) — insufficient/irregular sleep commonly linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive overnight heart‑rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z > 1); the 1–2 AM deviation correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).  
- Together these sleep/nocturnal-arousal indicators are the clearest signals in this profile that would push inferred PSS upward relative to the study mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 47 (Z ≈ +0.56); trait anxiety is a notable correlate of PSS in this dataset (r ≈ +0.31). This is one of the strongest single psychological risk signals in the profile.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (above clinical cutoff), which commonly co‑occurs with higher PSS.  
- Lower positive affect/health satisfaction and almost no exercise: lower happiness (Z ≈ −0.53), low health satisfaction (Z ≈ −1.61), and very low exercise (Z ≤ −1.9) remove behavioral and affective buffers against stress and point toward higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing
- Participant 1 was explicitly inferred in the description to be likely below their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.21). The strongest protective signals are very low GAD‑7 (GAD‑7 = 2; z ≈ −1.29) and relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +0.30). GAD‑7 has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so the very low anxiety symptom score is a powerful predictor pushing P1’s PSS below their mean despite pronounced sleep problems.  
- Participant 2 was explicitly inferred to be somewhat above their population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). The key risk signals are elevated trait anxiety and PSQI > 5; although many objective measures are protective (good objective sleep, strong circadian amplitude, low depression, high self‑esteem), the descriptive conclusion was that these subjective risk signals tip the balance to slightly above the population mean.

Weighing the overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: strong protective trait/daytime signals (especially minimal GAD‑7 with very large correlation to PSS) outweigh sleep-based risks when predicting overall perceived stress relative to P1’s study population. Net inference in the description: P1 likely below their population mean PSS.  
- Participant 2: while several objective physiological and social resources are protective, the presence of elevated trait anxiety and clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance—combined with lower positive affect/health satisfaction and no exercise—was judged in the description to produce a PSS slightly above that participant’s population mean. Net inference in the description: P2 likely slightly above their population mean PSS.

Conclusion
- Both summaries already frame stress relative to their respective population means. Given that Participant 1 is inferred below their mean and Participant 2 is inferred slightly above theirs, Participant 2 is the likelier individual to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Strong evening heart-rate peaks (8–9 pm deviation Z ≈ 2.09) — could reflect late-day physiological arousal.
- Late median sleep start (~02:25 AM) — potential chronotype or schedule-related misalignment that can sometimes associate with stressors.
- These physiological/timing signals are relatively small in their correlations with PSS in this sample and are counterbalanced by many strong protective indicators, so they are weaker reasons for higher PSS.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Participant 1’s risk indicators (very short objective sleep, severely disturbed subjective sleep, sizable pain elevation, and nocturnal HR activation) are large-magnitude, PSS-relevant abnormalities and several have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS. Those abnormalities point clearly toward higher-than-mean perceived stress in their sample.
- Participant 2 shows multiple strong protective signals relative to their sample (very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, very good subjective sleep, high happiness/self-esteem, strong circadian regularity, healthy sleep duration and low variability). The physiologic signals that could indicate elevated arousal (higher resting HR/mesor, evening HR peaks, late sleep timing) have smaller sample correlations with PSS and are plausibly lifestyle/chronotype effects rather than markers of high perceived stress.
- In short, Participant 1’s elevated stress-related markers are larger in magnitude and more directly tied to higher PSS in their dataset, while Participant 2’s few risk signals are smaller and outweighed by strong protective indicators.

19,17308,28,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 43); STAI–Trait correlates ~0.31 with PSS in that sample, so this is a plausible driver toward higher perceived stress.
- Slightly elevated alcohol use (1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.0), which is a small positive correlate of PSS.
- Modestly reduced circadian regularity (lower interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation; negative Zs) and some daytime heart-rate elevations relative to nocturnal troughs — both have modest associations with higher PSS.
- Together these factors indicate a measurable vulnerability in arousal/circadian regulation that could push perceived stress above the population mean under strain.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or only average) PSS
- Multiple strong protective signals: low depressive symptoms (CES-D), above-average happiness and health satisfaction (Zs positive), regular exercise (Z = 1.07), minimal drug use.
- Good objective and subjective sleep (median ~7.5 h, low night-to-night variability, PSQI borderline-good), tightly clustered sleep timing.
- Low resting heart rate and low mesor (Zs = -1.30, -1.79), consistent with lower baseline arousal and better cardiovascular fitness.
- The study summary explicitly characterizes this participant as “around the mean” rather than substantially above it.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Strong indicators of high stress: moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and GAD-7 has very strong correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.78).
- Severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = 1.0; PSQI–PSS r = 0.47), median nightly sleep ~2 h 38 m (Z = -0.94), very late and highly variable sleep onset (SD Z = 1.3). These are major contributors to higher PSS.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations during typical sleep hours (e.g., +13.5 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = 1.17; +9.8 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = 1.59), which correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Pain-related interference (PAPAS Z = 0.19) has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.48) and may further elevate perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (interdaily stability and autocorrelation negative Zs; intradaily variability Z = 0.92) consistent with physiological/behavioral dysregulation linked to higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or less elevated) PSS
- Protective traits: above-average self-efficacy (New GSE Z = 0.3; strong negative correlation with PSS r = -0.68) and low emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = -0.97; emotional lability–PSS r = 0.72). These are meaningful buffers.
- Some daytime cardiovascular measures are not clearly elevated and correlations with PSS are small or mixed.
- Nevertheless, the summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely above their population mean PSS.

Comparative, within-population-frame weighing
- Participant 1 is characterized as roughly near their study mean (population mean PSS = 21.61), with only modest risk signals (STAI, alcohol, circadian modest irregularity) outweighed by multiple robust protective factors (good sleep, low depression, exercise, low RHR).
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely above their study mean (population mean PSS = 20.75), driven by several strong, positively weighted predictors of PSS in that sample: moderate anxiety (strongest single predictor), extreme subjective/objective sleep disturbance (PSQI with moderate-to-strong correlation to PSS), and nocturnal physiological arousal. Protective factors (self-efficacy, low emotional lability) are present but the summary judges them insufficient to offset the strong stress-related signals.
- Because each description is already framed relative to its own study mean, the clearer and stronger convergence of predictors for elevated perceived stress in Participant 2 (especially the very strong GAD-7→PSS relationship and severe sleep pathology) indicates Participant 2 likely has the higher PSS than Participant 1.

22,37218,10,14,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = +0.83), a moderate predictor of higher PSS in this cohort.
- Wearable sleep metrics consistent with sleep problems: median recorded sleep duration extremely short (1 h 44 min; Z = -1.24) and high night-to-night start-time variability (~160 min) — these objective signals align with the PSQI and tend to push inferred PSS upward.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 average 7.78 (Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS composite Z ≈ +0.8; both moderately correlated with PSS and likely raise perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations (midnight–early morning) weakly associated with higher PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety: CES-D = 24 (Z ≈ +1.11) and STAI-trait = 49 (Z ≈ +0.76), both positively associated with PSS in that sample.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (Z ≈ +1.52), a strong predictor of higher PSS in that cohort.
- Objective sleep timing and duration problems: median sleep duration 6 h 1 min (Z ≈ -1.45), very late median sleep start (~03:56 AM) and ~74 min variability — patterns that correlate with higher PSS.
- Circadian and physiological indicators of strain: reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63), modest intradaily fragmentation, elevated late-night HR — each supporting higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral inactivity (no regular exercise), which commonly co-occurs with higher stress.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Both records are interpreted relative to similar population means (PSS ~21.5); therefore z-scores and stated correlations give a fair basis for cross-participant comparison.
- Magnitude and convergence of risk signals: Participant 2 shows multiple moderately large positive z-scores on constructs that correlate with PSS (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52; CES‑D Z ≈ +1.11; STAI Z ≈ +0.76), plus objective circadian/sleep-timing issues and nocturnal HR elevations. These signals converge toward an inference of above-mean perceived stress.
- Participant 1 has notable risk signals (PSQI Z ≈ +0.83; pain Z ≈ +0.7–0.8; problematic wearable sleep), but also several strong protective signals that are strongly inversely associated with PSS (very low GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.2; low emotional lability Z ≈ -1.17; robust circadian amplitude Z ≈ +1.38; low resting HR). The presence of these substantial protective indicators moderates the impact of the risk signals, leaving Participant 1 inferred near the population mean or only modestly above it.
- In sum, Participant 2 has more numerous and larger-magnitude risk indicators tied to PSS and fewer strong protective buffers than Participant 1, whose elevated sleep/pain signals are substantially offset by strong resilience markers.

Decision
- Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Strong trait anxiety: STAI trait = 62 (Z = 2.05), a markedly elevated signal within their sample and a known positive predictor of PSS in that dataset (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D = 22 (Z = 0.9), also positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Pronounced circadian dysregulation: very low amplitude (Z = −2.13) and very low interdaily stability (Z = −2.06), plus highly variable sleep timing (start-time SD Z = 2.89). These large-magnitude z-scores indicate strong disruption in domains that correlate (negatively) with PSS in that sample.  
- Elevated cardiovascular baseline: resting HR and MESOR Zs ≈ +1.1–1.2, consistent with higher arousal and modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.13).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (>5), contributing to higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong survey-based predictors highly correlated with PSS in their sample: mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5; GAD r = 0.80), emotional lability (r = 0.67), and poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; r = 0.59). These measures carry high predictive weight for PSS in this dataset.  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55), both positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50), can meaningfully raise perceived stress.  
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations that correlate with higher PSS (e.g., 1–3am r ≈ 0.40–0.45), suggesting sleep/autonomic disturbances tied to stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means (P1 > 21.61; P2 > 20.75). The question is which participant is likely to have the higher absolute PSS given the available signals.  
- Magnitude and extremeness of signals: Participant 1 shows multiple very large z-scores (STAI Z = +2.05; amplitude Z = −2.13; interdaily stability Z = −2.06; sleep timing variability Z = +2.89). Those extreme deviations across both psychological (trait anxiety) and physiological/circadian domains indicate a substantial multi-domain burden that tends to map onto higher PSS in that sample.  
- Predictive weight of measures: Participant 2’s strongest predictors (GAD-7, emotional lability, PSQI) have very high correlations with PSS in their sample (e.g., GAD r = 0.80), so even moderate elevations in these scales plausibly push P2 above their mean. However, P2’s objective physiology (robust amplitude Z = +0.95, autocorr Z = +0.91, long sleep Z = +1.64, consolidated daytime activation) are protective and likely attenuate the net elevation in PSS.  
- Balance of evidence: P1’s signals are both severe in magnitude and convergent across subjective symptomatology and objective physiological circadian disruption. P2 has strong subjective risk signals but countervailing, fairly pronounced objective protective signals. Given the large-magnitude z-scores and multi-domain convergence in Participant 1, P1 is more likely to have the higher absolute PSS.

- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.07), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z = −0.87) and attenuated HR rhythm amplitude (Z = −1.03). In the study these features modestly correlate with higher PSS.
- Morning heart‑rate deviations: early‑morning relative HR elevations and a pronounced morning peak (Z = 3.07) — these hourly deviations have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23) and could reflect transient schedule‑related arousal that maps to higher perceived stress in some cases.
- Caveat: effect sizes for these signals are small-to-moderate and are explicitly described as not outweighing strong protective self‑report signals.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS
- Severe and objectively corroborated sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 4 m, and very large night‑to‑night sleep‑start variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). PSQI and objective short/irregular sleep are strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (PSQI r = 0.50).
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9.0 with very strong correlation to PSS in the sample (r = 0.78); BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z = 0.43; r = 0.68). These are major contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Substance‑related difficulties and pain interference: BASIS‑24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — plausible stress amplifiers in this profile.
- Circadian instability: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.42), low amplitude (Z = −1.10), and reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z = −0.68) — rhythm metrics that, in the sample, are associated with higher PSS.
- Protective factors present but weaker relative to the risk signals: very high general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79; r with PSS = −0.63) and lower resting HR/mesor (Zs ≈ −0.55 to −0.66). These moderate risk but do not fully offset the multiple strong, PSS‑correlated indicators (especially extreme sleep disruption and high anxiety).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is explicitly assessed as most consistent with being below their study mean (21.65). The strongest signals (low trait anxiety STAI Z = −1.71, low depressive symptoms CES‑D Z = −1.07, high happiness and health satisfaction, good sleep duration and subjective sleep quality, frequent exercise) are robust protective indicators with direct links to lower perceived stress. The opposing signals (circadian fragmentation, HR rhythm blunting, morning HR spikes) have smaller effect sizes and more modest correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is explicitly assessed as most consistent with being above their study mean (21.33). Multiple large, convergent indicators that strongly correlate with PSS (extreme short/irregular sleep, high PSQI, GAD‑7 with r = 0.78, emotional lability, substance problems, circadian instability) point toward elevated perceived stress. Protective indicators (high self‑efficacy, lower resting HR) are meaningful but described as insufficient to counterbalance the strong risk signals.
- Relative weight: Participant 2’s risk signals are both larger in magnitude (e.g., ~3 hr median sleep) and more strongly correlated with PSS in their dataset (some correlations up to ~0.78) than Participant 1’s risk signals, which are modest circadian irregularities with smaller correlations. Participant 1’s dominant profile is protective and directly indicative of lower perceived stress.

Conclusion
- Overall balance of evidence: Participant 2 is much more likely to have a higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their study population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs. Thus Participant 2 appears to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- High sedentary/screen time (video games Z = 4.74, TV/videos Z = 3.17, internet Z = 2.19) — may reduce active coping and is modestly associated with higher PSS in-sample.  
- Low social-trust (Trust Z = -2.39) — possible interpersonal strain or lower perceived support can raise perceived stress.  
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:04 AM) and low exercise — timing/social strain and lack of physical-activity buffering could increase stress vulnerability.  
- Mildly elevated cardiac tonic measures (HR mesor Z ≈ 1.35; amplitude Z ≈ 1.72) — consistent with modestly higher arousal that correlates positively (though weakly) with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Very poor and highly variable sleep: PSQI = 15.5 (z = 0.67, “Disturbed”), median nightly duration 4 h 22 min, large night-to-night variability in duration (SD z = 0.89) and onset (SD z = 0.34). In this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).  
- Markedly elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z = 2.34) — substantial interpersonal strain that often contributes to perceived stress.  
- Reduced circadian regularity and blunted HR amplitude (interdaily stability, autocorrelation, cosinor amplitude all low) — disrupted daily structure commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.

Comparative framing relative to each study population (key points)
- Both descriptions are relative to their own study means: Participant 1’s population mean PSS = 21.64 (SD = 3.65); Participant 2’s population mean PSS = 21.29 (SD = 7.42).  
- Participant 1 shows multiple strong protective signals relative to their peers (very low depressive symptoms CES-D z = -1.38; very low trait anxiety STAI-Trait z = -2.11; high circadian regularity z ≈ +2.2 to +2.4). These large-magnitude protective z-scores argue the participant is below their population mean by a substantive margin. The risk signals for P1 exist but are smaller or more behaviorally specific (screen-time, low trust, late sleep timing).  
- Participant 2 shows a substantial signal for sleep disturbance and variability (extremely short median sleep duration and elevated sleep variability) and a large interpersonal-strain z-score (z = 2.34). Those are salient risk factors for higher PSS in that population. Participant 2 also has protective signs (very low GAD-7, low pain, lower resting HR), but the strongest single-domain signals (severe short sleep and interpersonal problems) are more directly and strongly linked to elevated PSS in this description (and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in that sample).  
- Magnitude comparison: P1’s largest protective z-scores (≈ -1.4 to -2.1 and circadian stability +2.2/+2.4) are large and consistent across domains. P2’s largest risk z-score (interpersonal z ≈ +2.34) and extreme behavioral sleep deprivation (very short absolute sleep duration well below typical norms) are strong risk indicators but coexist with several protective measures; overall the assessor judged P2 “near the sample mean, with a modest tilt toward being above the mean.” P1 was judged clearly below their population mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: overall profile points to perceived stress below their population mean (strong, multi-domain protective signals outweigh behavioral risks).  
- Participant 2: overall profile points to perceived stress near the population mean but plausibly somewhat above it, driven especially by severe/irregular sleep and interpersonal strain.

Final determination
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress) relative to their respective study population.

- Low physical activity (reports no exercise) — a behavioral correlate of higher stress in population studies.
- Lower current happiness and low health satisfaction (z ≈ -0.53 and -1.2), and recent academic decline (GPA 1.90) — psychosocial stressors that can raise perceived stress.
- High passive media and social time (large positive z-scores) — behavioral patterns often associated with stress or poorer coping.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11.5) and objectively very short sleep (median ~3.5 h) with very late sleep onset (~03:37 AM) — large abnormalities that strongly correlate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) — pain measures showing moderate positive correlations with PSS.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (positive deviations in late-night/early-morning hours with Z up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian amplitude/autocorrelation — physiological signs linked to higher PSS in the cohort.
- Convergence of behavioral (short, late sleep), subjective (high PSQI, pain), and physiological (nocturnal arousal, reduced rhythmicity) signals that have moderate-to-strong sample-level correlations with PSS.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each summary is anchored to its own study mean (Participant 1 mean PSS = 21.63; Participant 2 mean PSS = 21.21). Participant 1’s integrative summary explicitly places them near the study mean, with many objective physiology and symptom measures tilting toward lower perceived stress. Participant 2’s summary explicitly places them above their study mean, driven by large, concordant sleep-, pain-, and nocturnal-arousal signals.
- The magnitude and number of high-impact, PSS-related abnormalities are greater for Participant 2: very short objective sleep and very high PSQI are large deviations and are stated to have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS; pain and nocturnal HR elevations add concordant physiological evidence. Participant 1’s risk indicators are more behavioral/subjective and generally milder (PSQI only mildly elevated, long objective sleep, late but regular schedule), while multiple physiological and mood measures (low RHR, low IV, below-mean anxiety/depression) are protective.
- Participant 2 does have important protective factors (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy), which reduce certainty, but these do not fully counterbalance the pronounced sleep deprivation, pain, and nocturnal physiological activation that are strongly tied to higher perceived stress in that sample.
- Given both population means are similar, direct comparison of deviation magnitudes and the strength of PSS-related correlates favors Participant 2 as having the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Shorter-than-average sleep and late sleep timing (median ≈ 6 h 46 m; sleep start ≈ 01:50), which can undermine coping and raise perceived stress.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 m) and large variability in sleep timing—strong behavioral/physiological risk for elevated perceived stress.
- Substantial overnight heart-rate elevations around midnight–2 AM (e.g., +14.6 bpm at 1–2 AM) with the 1–2 AM deviation correlated moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46), indicating nocturnal arousal linked to higher stress.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Both descriptions are relative to their own sample means. Participant 1 is inferred to be near-to-slightly-below their sample mean (21.63) but with mixed signals; Participant 2 is inferred to be below their sample mean (21.21) with a clearer conclusion driven by very low daytime anxiety and high self-efficacy.
- Strength of predictive signals differs: Participant 2’s protective daytime measures (very low GAD-7, r ≈ 0.77; higher self-efficacy, r ≈ -0.65) are strongly correlated with PSS in that sample and provide powerful evidence for lower perceived stress despite sleep problems. Participant 1’s risk signals (STAI, low happiness) have weaker correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.31 and r ≈ -0.20) and are counterbalanced by strong physiological/circadian protections (high interdaily stability, low RHR).
- Participant 2’s primary risks are sleep-related and have moderate correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.48; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.46), but these appear outweighed by very strong daytime protective signals in that sample. Participant 1’s overall profile is more equivocal and closer to the sample mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence within each study frame, Participant 1 is more likely to have higher perceived stress relative to their peers than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63) and modest intradaily fragmentation — objective circadian markers that align with higher stress.
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate elevation and modestly elevated mesor/RHR (Z ≈ +0.3), suggesting physiological arousal at night.
- Low exercise frequency/behavioral inactivity (large negative Z), which typically co‑occurs with higher stress.

- The profile was judged “likely above the mean but not extreme.”

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ +0.67). In this sample PSQI correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.53).
- Elevated pain/functional impairment (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93), with PAPAS also strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.53).
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.62). NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS in this sample (r = -0.69), so below‑average NGSE strongly predicts higher PSS.
- Elevated nocturnal heart‑rate deviations (12–3 AM Zs up to ≈ +1.38) and elevated mesor/RHR (Z ≈ +0.7), physiological signals that correlate with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83) and late acrophase — less day‑to‑day regularity associated with higher PSS in the sample.

Protective/mitigating factors noted for Participant 2
- Low GAD‑7 (score 5; Z ≈ -0.76). Because anxiety correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.76), this is a notable protective factor against very high PSS.
- Long median nightly sleep (8 h 4 min; Z ≈ +0.92) and low intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ -1.28) — features that may mitigate stress-related impairment.

Comparative reasoning (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population PSS means, but the nature and strength of predictors differ.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and markedly disturbed/short/late sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52; sleep duration Z ≈ -1.45). However, the reported correlations of those scales with PSS in that sample are moderate (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), and several protective factors (no substance use, high GPA, above‑average interdaily stability) were present, leading to the assessment that P1 is “modestly elevated” above mean rather than extreme.
- Participant 2 shows multiple stress‑related signals that, in this sample, have relatively strong correlations with PSS: low self‑efficacy (NGSE, r = -0.69), subjective sleep and pain (PSQI & PAPAS, r ≈ 0.53), and sizable nocturnal HR elevations and elevated mesor/RHR (Zs ≈ 0.6–1.4) that are tied to PSS. Although P2 has some protective signs (low GAD‑7, long sleep duration), several of the strongest sample‑level predictors of PSS are elevated for P2 (notably NGSE and PAPAS), and physiological markers are more pronounced than for P1.
- The relative magnitudes of objective physiological stress markers favor Participant 2 (larger nocturnal HR Zs, higher mesor/RHR Zs, and worse interdaily stability), whereas Participant 1’s physiological markers are milder. Participant 1’s larger PSQI Z is important but weighted against weaker PSS correlations for their elevated affective measures and several protective behaviors.

Weighting the balance of evidence
- Taking into account (a) the number of elevated risk indicators, (b) the strength of sample‑level correlations between those indicators and PSS, and (c) the relative presence of protective factors, Participant 2’s profile is more consistent with a higher degree of perceived stress above their study mean than Participant 1’s profile is above theirs.
- In short: Participant 1 = above mean but moderately so with several protective buffers; Participant 2 = above mean with multiple strong predictors (low self‑efficacy, pain, PSQI, pronounced nocturnal HR elevation, reduced interdaily stability) that in this sample have relatively large associations with PSS.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, Z ≈ +1.52) plus objectively late and shortened sleep (median sleep 6 h 1 min, Z ≈ -1.45; median sleep start ~03:56 AM and high start-time variability). These circadian/sleep features are strongly linked with higher PSS in the summary.
- Blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63), modest intradaily fragmentation, and late-night heart-rate elevation—physiological patterns that align with elevated stress.
- Behavioral inactivity (no regular exercise), which commonly co-occurs with higher stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study population mean PSS. Participant 1’s profile was assessed as overall below that population mean; Participant 2’s profile was assessed as above their population mean.
- Strength and number of convergent risk signals favor Participant 2 being more stressed: Participant 2 shows multiple moderately large positive z-scores on constructs that correlate with PSS (CES‑D Z ≈ +1.11; PSQI Z ≈ +1.52; STAI Z ≈ +0.76), plus objective circadian/HR markers consistent with higher stress.
- Participant 1 has one very salient risk domain (severe objective sleep restriction and high intradaily variability), but the strongest predictors in that sample (low GAD‑7, high general self‑efficacy, very low emotional lability) all point toward lower perceived stress and have strong sample correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). Thus the net inference for Participant 1 was below the sample mean despite poor sleep.
- Considering convergence (multiple affective and sleep/circadian risk indicators for Participant 2 vs. a mixed profile for Participant 1 where powerful affective/protective indicators outweigh sleep risk), Participant 2 is the more likely to have the higher PSS.

22,93699,10,13,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (as described relative to their population mean)
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), a strong correlate of higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated trait anxiety and negative affect indicators: STAI–Trait z ≈ +0.27; lower happiness and low health satisfaction (z ≈ −1.11) that align with greater perceived stress.
- Later, shorter, and more variable sleep timing: median sleep ≈ 6h51m (z ≈ −0.42), sleep start ~00:59, sleep-start SD ≈ 89 min — patterns associated with higher PSS.
- High evening/late-night internet use: Internet use z ≈ +2.19, a behavioral factor likely to exacerbate sleep disruption and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation: resting HR z ≈ +0.79 and mesor z ≈ +0.74, consistent with low-to-moderate autonomic activation that correlates positively with PSS.
- Holistic summary provided: the study write-up explicitly concludes the participant is most consistent with PSS above the sample mean (though not extreme).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (as described relative to their population mean)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (z = +0.83), and wearable sleep metrics suggesting very short/irregular sleep (median 1h44m, start-time SD ≈ 160 min); PSQI has a strong correlation with PSS (r = 0.58).
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 z ≈ +0.71 and PAPAS z ≈ +0.8; both moderately-to-strongly correlated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal, which can align with higher perceived stress.

Comparative considerations within each study-frame
- Both participant summaries indicate some elevation relative to their cohort means: Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above the sample mean; Participant 2 is characterized as near the mean with a modest upward contribution from sleep and pain.
- Strength and balance of predictors differ: Participant 1 has multiple moderate risk signals (PSQI z ~+1.05, trait anxiety, late/variable sleep, very high evening internet use z ≈ +2.19, elevated resting HR) and fewer, milder protective signals. Participant 2 has strong risk signals in sleep and pain but also several robust protective indicators (very low GAD-7 z ≈ −1.2, low emotional lability z ≈ −1.17, higher self-efficacy, strong circadian robustness: intradaily variability z ≈ −1.35, amplitude z ≈ +1.38, resting HR z ≈ −1.02).
- Relative predictor strengths: Participant 2’s low generalized anxiety and strong physiological/circadian resilience are strong negative predictors of PSS (noted large sample correlations), likely offsetting the elevated PSQI and pain to keep overall PSS nearer to the mean. By contrast, Participant 1’s constellation is more uniformly oriented toward elevated perceived stress (subjective sleep problems, anxiety, behavioral arousal, higher resting HR), with fewer countervailing strengths.

Weighing the overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple converging moderate risk indicators and explicit conclusion of above-mean PSS (modest-to-moderate elevation).
- Participant 2: notable, targeted riskors (sleep, pain) but several strong protective factors that the summary indicates keep inferred PSS near the cohort mean (only a modest upward push).
- Therefore, Participant 1’s profile is more consistently suggestive of higher overall perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 2’s profile is relative to theirs.

15,21932,15,13,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population):
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (above common clinical threshold; z ≈ 0.59) — subjective poor sleep reliably associates with higher PSS.
- Elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (IV = 0.68, z = 0.95) — suggests more fragmented/irregular within-day physiology weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Pronounced hourly heart-rate deviations at midday and late evening (notable z-scores up to ~3) — indicate episodic physiological arousal at specific times that could drive elevated momentary stress.
- Muted positive momentary affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53) — lower positive affect correlates with higher PSS in the sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5, z = 0.67) — PSQI correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- High pain/functional impairment (PAPAS = 81, z = 0.93) — also strongly positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62) — NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so lower NGSE is a robust predictor of higher PSS.
- Elevated circadian heart-rate metrics (mesor and RHR z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and aggregated nocturnal HR deviations (midnight–3 AM Zs up to ~1.38) — these physiologic markers have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Reduced interdaily stability (z = -0.83) and late acrophase — less regular daily timing is associated (albeit modestly) with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Each description is given relative to its own population mean. Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes most trait and objective indicators point to perceived stress below that study’s mean; the higher-risk signals for P1 (PSQI, IV, hourly HR peaks) have generally modest-to-weak sample correlations with PSS and coexist with large protective signals (low CES-D/STAI-Trait, high RSES, long/regular objective sleep, low resting HR).
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple, moderately strong signals that in this sample show substantial associations with higher PSS (notably PSQI and PAPAS with r ≈ 0.53, and NGSE with r ≈ -0.69). Physiological markers (higher mesor/RHR and nocturnal HR elevations) and reduced interdaily stability are additional converging lines of evidence pointing above that study’s mean. While Participant 2 has some protective features (low GAD-7, long median sleep duration, low IV), these are weaker or less directly predictive in the provided correlation context than the stress-consistent features.
- Magnitude and consistency: Participant 1’s stress-related signals are more circumscribed and weaker in their sample-level relationships to PSS, whereas Participant 2 shows multiple, convergent indicators (subjective sleep, pain, self-efficacy, nocturnal physiology) that are each moderately to strongly associated with higher PSS in that cohort.

5,99733,14,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 1’s study frame, mean = 21.33)
- Severe and objectively-validated sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), median wearable sleep ≈ 3h04m, and extremely large sleep-start variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). These sleep metrics have substantial positive correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r = 0.50; sleep irregularity correlated with PSS).
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9.0 and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = 0.43; GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.78) and emotional lability correlates strongly too (r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain-related interference: Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — both plausible contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian rhythm disruption: Multiple rhythm metrics (low interdaily stability Z = −1.42; low amplitude Z = −1.10) that in this sample trend with higher PSS.
- Relative weighting of signals: Several of the strongest PSS-correlated measures (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, circadian instability) converge on the same direction, yielding a coherent signal for above-mean stress.

Protective/offsetting evidence (still in Participant 1’s frame)
- Very high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.79), which strongly negatively correlates with PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.63).
- Lower resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ −0.55 and −0.66), modestly protective/neutral in this dataset.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame, mean = 21.62)
- Physiological/circadian markers consistent with stress: Intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.09, reduced autocorrelation at 24h Z ≈ −0.53, reduced amplitude Z ≈ −0.43, and modestly elevated resting HR Z ≈ +0.53. These metrics have small but positive associations with PSS in this sample (correlations roughly 0.14–0.22 for some hourly or rhythm features).
- Irregular sleep timing/variability: Sleep start SD ≈ 65 min and duration SD ≈ 86 min, which correlate modestly with higher PSS.

Protective/offsetting evidence (in Participant 2’s frame)
- Low self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES-D Z ≈ −0.86; STAI Z ≈ −1.02) and above-average self-esteem, all robustly associated with lower PSS.
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4) and near-typical sleep duration (median ≈ 6h43m), minimal substance use — these behavioral/self-report signals point toward below-mean or at-most-average perceived stress.
- Overall integrated inference in Participant 2’s summary was “near the population mean,” with only modest tilt toward higher when physiological signals are weighted.

Comparative reasoning across the two within-population frames
- Strength and consistency of stress-linked signals: Participant 1 shows multiple, large, and mutually-consistent indicators that have strong correlations with PSS in that sample (extremely short objective sleep, extreme sleep timing variability, elevated anxiety, substance problems). The magnitude of deviation on key loaders (e.g., sleep-start SD Z = 2.82; substance Z = 1.75) is large.
- Participant 2’s higher-stress indicators are mainly physiological and more modest in effect size (largest Z ≈ +1.09 for intradaily variability) and have smaller correlations with PSS in that dataset. Crucially, Participant 2’s self-report symptom measures (which correlate strongly with PSS) indicate low distress, producing discordant signals and an overall “near-mean” classification.
- Protective factors for Participant 1 (notably high self-efficacy) are meaningful but appear insufficient to fully offset the multiple strong PSS-positive signals, especially the extreme objective sleep disruption and strong anxiety correlations. Participant 2’s protective self-report profile is stronger and better aligned (low CES-D/STAI, good PSQI), reducing the likelihood of substantially above-mean PSS despite physiological signs.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1 presents a stronger, more coherent, and larger-magnitude set of indicators that — in that study’s correlational structure — predict above-mean perceived stress.
- Participant 2’s profile is mixed but centers on near-mean PSS, with physiological markers giving only a modest upward nudge that is not corroborated by strong self-reported distress.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",5,Pain,14,99733,NetHealth,18
3,87328,13,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study-frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7). PSQI is directly associated with higher PSS in this sample and can boost daily stress reporting even when objective sleep time is adequate.
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start 01:26) and modestly elevated nap rate (Z = 1.21). Those behaviors correlate weakly with higher PSS in the dataset and can reflect evening arousal or schedule pressure.
- Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (peak Z ≈ 2.62 around 6–7 PM), which could indicate sustained arousal that is associated with higher perceived stress.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.20), which can contribute modestly to greater perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study-frame)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). In this sample PSQI has a relatively strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), so this is a substantial risk factor.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS). These measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47) and the participant’s values indicate non-trivial burden.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which may reduce social support and contribute to stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), suggesting higher basal physiological arousal that can accompany stress.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5), which positively correlates with PSS (GAD-7 ↔ PSS r ≈ 0.77 in the dataset), though here the score is mild.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing evidence
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are robust protective factors: very low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 0, Z ≈ -1.38), low trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ -1.81), high self‑esteem/happiness (Z ≈ +1.6), strong circadian regularity (amplitude Z ≈ +1.78; interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.0), and low resting heart rate. Several of these features have modest-to-meaningful negative correlations with PSS in the sample and together point convincingly toward below-mean PSS in that study.
- Participant 1’s risk indicators (PSQI = 7, late sleep timing, evening HR elevation) are present but generally weaker or fewer in number compared with the protective signals; the summary explicitly concluded the participant is likely below the study mean (21.63).
- Participant 2 shows a mixture: strong protective resources (high NGSE Z ≈ +1.41, which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS r ≈ -0.63; strong circadian regularity; low emotional lability) but also multiple moderate-to-strong risk factors (PSQI = 10.5 with r ≈ 0.47 to PSS; pain/interference with r ≈ 0.42–0.47; interpersonal strain; elevated resting HR). The study summary judged Participant 2 to be near the population mean (21.38), perhaps slightly below it, but notably closer to the mean than Participant 1 is to theirs.
- Comparing across participants relative to their own samples: Participant 1’s profile is more unambiguously protective (several strong negative predictors of PSS and very low anxiety/depression), while Participant 2 carries more and stronger risk indicators that are known to be associated with higher PSS in their sample (notably much worse PSQI and pain/interference), even though they also have a strong protective NGSE. Thus, on balance Participant 2’s net risk for higher perceived stress is greater than Participant 1’s.

Decision
Based on the number, magnitude, and study-specific correlations of risk vs. protective features, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Fragmented daily physiology: elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (0.73; z ≈ 1.30) and low 24‑hr autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.87).  
- Slightly elevated mean daily naps (z ≈ 1.49), consistent with compensatory sleep.  
- These objective features have modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample (intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15; sleep variability r ≈ 0.13), so they provide limited upward pressure on inferred PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any):
- Severe clinical anxiety: GAD‑7 = 18 (z ≈ 1.51), a measure with a strong positive correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.75).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (z ≈ 0.83), PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47). Short median sleep (~4 h 55 m) reinforces the sleep problem.  
- High pain and activity interference: PEG‑3 and PAPAS (z ≈ 1.4–1.6), both positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).  
- Low self‑efficacy: NGSE z ≈ -1.73, and NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.61), indicating a strong predictor of higher perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM z = 2.83; 2–3 AM z ≈ 2.14) with some nighttime HR windows positively correlated with PSS (e.g., 1–2 AM r ≈ 0.34).  
- While there are some protective wearable features (higher amplitude, higher interdaily stability, low intradaily variability), the dominant, strongly correlated symptom signals point to higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as likely below (or at most near) their study mean PSS (mean = 21.6). The strongest evidence for lower stress is subjective: low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, good PSQI, low substance use—these have stronger and more direct links to lower PSS in this profile than the wearable irregularities have to raise it. The wearable markers that suggest risk have only small associations with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as above their study mean PSS (mean = 20.62). Multiple strong, directly relevant indicators—severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, high pain/interference, and low self‑efficacy—have relatively large effect sizes and correlations with PSS. The nocturnal physiological arousal further aligns with these symptom measures. Protective circadian features are present but are weaker counterweights compared with the strong symptom signals.

Balance of evidence:
- The predictors and correlations favor Participant 2 as having the higher perceived stress. Participant 2 shows several large, converging, strongly PSS‑related signals (especially severe anxiety and low self‑efficacy) plus corroborating nocturnal physiology. Participant 1’s putative stress signals are primarily modestly correlated wearable irregularities and are outweighed by robust subjective wellbeing measures indicating lower stress relative to that cohort.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",89652,NetHealth,28,4,Pain,31
21,34062,30,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 12). This is the single strongest predictor in the summary (high correlation with PSS ≈ 0.77) and points toward above‑mean perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5, z ≈ +1.32), which correlates with higher PSS and is a substantial stress-related signal.
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight hourly heart‑rate deviations above the sample mean (e.g., +11.9 bpm at 12–1am, z ≈ +1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (≈ 0.22–0.39).
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) combined with its strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ −0.66) supports greater perceived stress vulnerability.
- Elevated substance‑use subscale (BASIS‑24 z ≈ +1.5)—while weakly correlated with PSS here—can be a stress‑related behavior to monitor.

Factors mitigating stress for Participant 1 (reduce confidence in very high PSS): objectively adequate sleep duration (median ~7 h 19 min, z ≈ +0.66), lower resting heart rate (z ≈ −0.64), preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation—these temper but do not outweigh the high‑impact psychological signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Substantially disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 10, z ≈ +1.52), a robust correlate of elevated perceived stress.
- Wearable indicators of circadian fragmentation/irregularity (low interdaily stability and strongly negative 24‑hour autocorrelation z ≈ −0.87, slightly reduced amplitude, modestly elevated intradaily variability, variable sleep start times), which are associated with higher PSS.

Factors arguing against higher PSS for Participant 2 (strong mitigators): low depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ −0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ −0.52); high self‑esteem and happiness (z ≈ +1.38 and +1.64); high health satisfaction (z ≈ +1.80); regular exercise and low/no substance use; very low resting heart rate and low mesor (z ≈ −1.48 and −2.08) indicating low tonic arousal/fitness—these collectively point toward PSS at or below the study mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1’s profile is explicitly interpreted in the summary as “above the study sample mean” (population PSS mean = 20.67). The elevation is driven by multiple high‑impact, PSS‑correlated signals (especially anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) plus nocturnal physiological arousal—these weigh heavily toward higher perceived stress relative to Participant 1’s peers.
- Participant 2’s profile is explicitly interpreted as “near or slightly below the study mean” (population PSS mean = 21.6). Although sleep/circadian measures are concerning (PSQI z slightly larger than Participant 1’s PSQI z), Participant 2 has multiple strong protective psychosocial and physiological signals (low anxiety/depression, high self‑esteem/happiness, low resting HR, regular exercise) that counterbalance the sleep/circadian risks and yield an overall PSS at or below their population mean.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Participant 1 shows clustered, high‑impact indicators that correlate strongly with PSS (notably GAD‑7 and PSQI) plus nocturnal physiological arousal—interpreted as above their population mean.
- Participant 2 shows a mixed profile where sleep/circadian disruption suggests possible higher stress but is counterbalanced by multiple strong protective factors; the summary rates them near/slightly below their population mean.

Given these within‑population framings and the relative strength of anxiety + poor sleep + nocturnal autonomic arousal for Participant 1 versus Participant 2’s strong psychosocial/physiological protective signals, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; classified as disturbed sleep; PSQI correlates moderately with PSS, r = 0.46).
- Very short wearable-derived sleep (median ~3 h 27 min) and high night-to-night sleep variability — objective sleep restriction is a substantial stressor even if its sample-level correlation is moderate.
- High intradaily variability in circadian/rest–activity rhythm (Z = 2.29), indicating fragmented/irregular day–night organization that in the sample trends toward higher PSS.
- Increased daytime napping and some interpersonal-strain score elevation (BASIS-24 interpersonal relationships Z = 0.94), which could add psychosocial stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; meets common threshold for disturbed sleep) despite objectively long sleep.
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.95) and pronounced hourly heart-rate deviations (midday and late-evening peaks, some Z > 2), consistent with episodic physiological arousal that could raise perceived stress.
- Some reduction in momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which correlates with higher PSS.

Comparative weighing of evidence
- Participant 1’s strongest signals for higher stress are sleep-related and circadian fragmentation; these are fairly pronounced (very short objective sleep and high intradaily variability). However, several of the sample’s strongest predictors of PSS (very low GAD-7, relatively high self-efficacy, very low emotional lability) point toward lower perceived stress for Participant 1. The summary explicitly judged the profile mixed but ultimately leaning below the population mean, with notable sleep-related risk.
- Participant 2 has some episodic physiological arousal and subjective sleep complaints, but many robust protective signals: very low trait depression and trait anxiety, high self-esteem, objectively long and regular sleep, and low resting heart rate. The summary judged Participant 2’s overall profile more consistently protective and more clearly below their population mean PSS than the mixed profile for Participant 1.
- Relative comparison: although both participants are inferred to be below their respective study means, Participant 1 exhibits a more severe objective sleep deficit and greater circadian fragmentation—features that are plausibly more likely to elevate perceived stress than Participant 2’s primarily episodic arousal signals. Participant 2’s protective trait and objective-sleep signals are stronger and more consistent than Participant 1’s protective signals, making Participant 2 less likely to have higher perceived stress.

- Late median sleep onset (~01:53 AM) and somewhat short sleep duration (~6 h 35 min) that can increase perceived stress or reduce recovery.
- Pronounced evening/nighttime heart-rate elevations (large deviations around midnight), suggesting repeated late-evening physiological arousal.
- Elevated intradaily variability (some daytime fragmentation) and borderline PSQI (5), which can modestly associate with higher stress.
- Weekly alcohol use and high time in sedentary hobbies (video gaming) which can be neutral-to-modest risk factors for higher perceived stress if used maladaptively.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5) and very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min), both strongly linked to increased perceived stress in this sample (PSQI correlates with PSS, r ≈ 0.53).
- Large night-to-night variability in sleep duration and timing, and low interdaily stability, indicating disrupted circadian/behavioral structure that commonly accompanies higher stress.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score on BASIS-24 (z ≈ 2.34), a salient contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and weakened rhythm organization (reduced cosinor amplitude, low autocorrelation), features that often co-occur with higher stress or poorer coping.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is written relative to its study population mean PSS. Participant 1 is explicitly inferred as below their study mean (mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68), supported by strong, multiple indicators of low distress (very low CES-D and STAI, high happiness/self‑esteem, stable circadian amplitude, low resting HR, regular routines). The stress-relevant signals for P1 are focused and moderate (late-evening arousal, somewhat short sleep), and the overall inference in the description is clearly below the sample mean.
- Participant 2 is described as near the study mean (mean PSS = 21.29, SD = 7.42) with a modest tilt toward being above the mean. The strongest signals for P2 that point toward higher perceived stress are severe subjective sleep disturbance, extremely short and highly variable wearable-measured sleep, and marked interpersonal strain — relatively strong, independently meaningful risk factors for elevated PSS in that study. Protective signs (very low GAD-7, low pain, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR) moderate but do not fully counterbalance the strong sleep/interpersonal indicators.
- Relative strength and consistency of indicators: Participant 1 shows multiple converging low-stress indicators across self-report and physiology. Participant 2 shows multiple converging high-stress indicators in sleep and interpersonal domains, despite some protective signs. Given that each profile is anchored to its own population mean, Participant 2’s profile more closely aligns with above-mean perceived stress while Participant 1’s aligns with below-mean perceived stress.

- Modest elevations on symptom measures that correlate with PSS: STAI trait anxiety = 44 (Z ≈ 0.27) and CES‑D = 15 (Z ≈ 0.18).
- Subjective sleep complaint (PSQI = 6, above clinical cutpoint) and late/variable sleep timing (median start ~00:57; night‑to‑night SD ~63 min) — subjective sleep problems are associated with higher PSS.
- Objective circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.74) and mild intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.32), plus some early‑morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS.
- Lower recent happiness and health satisfaction (small negative Zs) that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) and objective concordance: very late sleep onset (~01:42) and short median sleep (~4 h 55 min).
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS, Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which positively correlate with PSS.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73) — strong negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61).
- Clear physiological night‑time hyperarousal: large positive nocturnal HR deviations (several hourly windows Z > 2) that are themselves correlated with higher PSS.
- While some circadian rhythm metrics (interdaily stability, amplitude) are protective, they are smaller/partial mitigators compared with the large symptom and physiological signals above.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s risk signals are mostly small-to-moderate in magnitude and several protective factors are relatively large (self‑esteem Z = 1.38; frequent exercise; adequate sleep duration Z ≈ 0.56; low substance use). The net inference in that study is “near the mean, possibly slightly above.”
- Participant 2’s risk signals are larger, both in Z-score magnitude and in their direct correlations with PSS (especially severe anxiety and low self‑efficacy). Objective physiology (pronounced nocturnal HR elevations) and severe sleep restriction align with the self-report symptom burden. The study-level interpretation is clearly “above the mean.”
- Effect-size and coherence: Participant 2 shows multiple large, concordant indicators (high Zs, strong PSS correlations, physiological corroboration) pointing to elevated perceived stress. Participant 1 shows weaker risk indicators that are substantially offset by strong resilience factors.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 demonstrates a stronger, more coherent, and higher-magnitude set of predictors of elevated PSS relative to their cohort mean than Participant 1 does relative to theirs.
- Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

3,69831,13,16,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1's study population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed) — PSQI is positively correlated with PSS in this cohort and can drive perceived stress.
- Very late median sleep onset (~01:34 AM) and associated circadian delay, which can be linked to daytime functioning problems and greater perceived stress in population studies.
- Low physical activity (reports no exercise; Z ≈ -1.6 to -1.9), a known risk factor for higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral pattern of heavy passive media/social use (high Z-scores for socializing, music, internet use) that often co-occurs with poorer coping and greater perceived stress.
- Recent academic deterioration (term GPA 1.90) — a salient psychosocial stressor that can raise perceived stress and worry.
- Lower current happiness and health satisfaction (z-scores negative), which are subjective indicators that commonly accompany elevated perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2's study population)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), substantially elevated and moderately correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47).
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) above median and correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.42–0.47), suggesting somatic contributors to stress.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), a potential social stressor even if its sample-level correlation with PSS is small.
- Higher resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ +1.2), which could reflect increased basal autonomic arousal in some individuals and may accompany stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participant summaries conclude the individual's inferred PSS is near their study mean rather than clearly extreme. Thus decisions should hinge on the balance of risk vs. protective indicators relative to each sample.
- Participant 1 shows multiple behavioral and situational risk factors (poor subjective sleep though long duration, very late sleep timing, no exercise, academic decline, low happiness/health satisfaction, heavy passive media use) but has objectively low physiological arousal (low resting HR, robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability) and below-average trait anxiety/depression—features interpreted as protective or indicative of lower physiological stress.
- Participant 2 exhibits several targeted risk factors that are more directly tied to PSS in this sample (very high PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain, slightly elevated physiological arousal), but also has strong, highly predictive protective factors (high general self-efficacy with a strong inverse correlation to PSS, pronounced circadian regularity, low emotional lability, minimal substance use). The summary explicitly weighs the strong NGSE protective effect as outweighing the risks, yielding an inferred stress at-or-slightly-below the population mean.
- The relative magnitudes of the strongest correlates matter: for Participant 2, NGSE (r ≈ -0.63) and GAD-7 (r ≈ +0.77) are the largest predictors; this participant has high NGSE (protective) and only mild GAD-7 (low risk). Participant 1 lacks comparably strong protective or risk predictors tied to the largest sample-level correlations; instead they have multiple moderate behavioral risks but also physiologic protection.

Overall judgement
- Balancing the evidence, Participant 1 presents a broader set of behavioral and situational risk factors that plausibly increase perceived stress (and fewer very strong protective psychological resources), while Participant 2 despite some important risks (notably very poor subjective sleep and pain) has strong psychological resilience (high NGSE) and highly regular routines that the dataset indicates are strongly protective.
- Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress relative to their respective sample.

21,70125,30,29,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated mood symptom scores that are known predictors of PSS in this sample: CES‑D = 24 (Z = 1.11, “Depressed”) and STAI = 50 (Z = 0.86, “anxious”). These are the most salient clinical elevations in this profile.  
- Disturbed and irregular sleep: PSQI > 5, late median sleep onset (~01:44), and high night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep SD Z = 1.32). Sleep/circadian disruption is conceptually and empirically linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Reduced circadian regularity from wearable HR (interdaily stability, amplitude, 24‑h autocorrelation all reduced), which aligns with patterns seen in higher stress and poorer mood.  
- Low social trust and modest health satisfaction (trust Z = -1.74; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95), which may increase vulnerability to stress.  
- Overall weighting in the description: although there are protective factors, the summary concludes the pattern is most consistent with PSS above the sample mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 12). Critically in this study GAD‑7 has a very large correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so even a moderate Z (0.46) is a strong predictor of higher PSS in this population.  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, Z = 1.32) with a substantial correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45). This is an extreme PSQI value in its sample.  
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: large overnight HR deviations (e.g., +11.92 bpm at 12–1am, Z ≈ 1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39), indicating poor nighttime recovery linked to perceived stress.  
- Emotion‑regulation difficulties (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability) and lower self‑efficacy; these measures have strong correlations with PSS in this dataset (BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.68; NGSE r ≈ -0.66), increasing the expected PSS impact.  
- The integrated summary for this participant also concludes the profile is above the study mean, driven primarily by anxiety, extreme subjective sleep problems, and nocturnal physiological arousal.

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s highlighted predictors (GAD‑7, BASIS‑24 emotional lability, PSQI) have much stronger correlations with PSS in their study (roughly 0.45–0.77) than the strongest predictors in Participant 1’s study (CES‑D and STAI correlate with PSS ≈ 0.28–0.31). That means, per their respective samples, a given elevation in Participant 2’s key measures more strongly implies higher PSS than comparable elevations in Participant 1’s measures.  
- Magnitude of elevations: Participant 1 shows larger absolute z‑deviations on mood measures (CES‑D Z = 1.11; STAI Z = 0.86) and substantial sleep irregularity (sleep SD Z = 1.32). Participant 2’s anxiety Z is more modest (0.46) but PSQI is extreme (Z = 1.32) and nocturnal HR deviations are elevated (Z ≈ 1.0).  
- Protective factors: Both participants have some physiological/behavioral protective signals (low resting HR, exercise for P1; adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR, preserved circadian autocorrelation for P2). These mitigate but do not negate the high‑impact predictors.  
- Overall predictive signal: Because Participant 2’s elevated features (even some of moderate Z) map onto measures that are much more strongly predictive of PSS in that study, the net expected PSS elevation is likely greater for Participant 2 than for Participant 1, despite Participant 1’s larger absolute mood z‑scores.

Conclusion
Based on the relative strength of measures’ associations with PSS in each study and the pattern of elevated high‑impact predictors (anxiety, extreme subjective sleep disturbance, nocturnal autonomic arousal, and emotion‑regulation deficits) in Participant 2, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

4,22455,31,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Objective circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32) — features that are modestly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Shorter and more variable sleep: median nightly sleep ~6 h 7 min (Z ≈ -1.33) and increased sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94), both of which have small positive correlations with PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure time (e.g., TV use Z ≈ +2.54) which is weakly associated with higher PSS here.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (5–7 AM with very large Zs) that are physiologically atypical; if they reflect frequent awakenings or stress-related arousal rather than planned activity, they could reflect higher perceived stress (though interpretation is uncertain and may be artifactual).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ +1.51) and anxiety correlates very strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.75) — a major predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83), plus late sleep onset (~1:42 AM) and short median sleep (~4 h 55 min), all associated with higher PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.47).
- High pain and activity interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Zs ≈ +1.4–1.6, which positively correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42) and likely increase perceived stress via reduced coping capacity.
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -1.73; NGSE correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ -0.61), so this is a robust predictor of elevated perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive nightly heart-rate deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = +2.83; 2–3 AM Z ≈ +2.14) that align with subjective insomnia/hyperarousal and have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS (e.g., 1–2 AM r ≈ 0.34).

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each description is framed relative to its own study mean (P1 mean 21.59; P2 mean 20.62). Participant 1 is inferred to be below their study mean, primarily because strong self-report predictors of stress (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, happiness/health) are favorable and have meaningful correlations with PSS in that cohort (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.32). The wearable indicators that point toward higher stress in P1 are weaker predictors (smaller correlations) and/or uncertain in interpretation.
- Participant 2 is inferred to be above their study mean, with multiple strong, convergent indicators (severe anxiety with very high correlation to PSS, high PSQI, low self-efficacy, elevated pain) and corroborating nocturnal physiological signals. Several of these predictors have larger effect sizes/correlations with PSS than the stress-relevant signals in Participant 1.
- The strongest single predictors favoring higher stress for P2 (GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.75; NGSE with r ≈ -0.61) are substantially more predictive of PSS than the strongest stress-related signals in P1 (e.g., wearable circadian features with r values around ±0.15–0.16). Even allowing for uncertainty in wearable anomalies (P1 early-morning HR vs P2 nocturnal HR), the magnitude and coherence of P2’s symptom signal outweigh P1’s mixed profile.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: overall profile points toward lower perceived stress relative to their cohort mean, with some wearable-derived circadian/sleep irregularities that could modestly elevate stress but are weaker predictors and partly ambiguous.
- Participant 2: multiple strong, convergent self-report and physiological indicators point toward higher perceived stress relative to their cohort mean; key predictors have large effect sizes and are coherent (anxiety, sleep disturbance, low self-efficacy, pain, nocturnal HR arousal).
- Conclusion: Participant 2 is much more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

9,59863,12,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which in the sample correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46). This supports higher perceived stress.
- Severe objective sleep restriction: median nightly sleep = 3 h 27 m and high sleep-duration variability (SD = 197 min). Very short sleep quantity is plausibly a strong stressor.
- Fragmented rest–activity/circadian pattern: high intradaily variability (Z = +2.29) with a positive sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.24), consistent with higher stress.
- Increased nap frequency (Z = +1.24), which often accompanies sleep disruption and stress.
- Some interpersonal strain indicated by BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale (Z ≈ +0.94), which could raise stress (though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Elevated cardiac tone: resting heart rate z ≈ +1.13 and heart-rate mesor z ≈ +2.36. These physiological markers have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (RHR r ≈ +0.14, mesor r ≈ +0.07), suggesting possible greater perceived stress or autonomic activation.
- Some hourly heart-rate deviations (early morning/daytime) that show small positive correlations with PSS, consistent with modest physiological arousal.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing the evidence:
- Both participant profiles were interpreted in their source summaries as having perceived stress below their population means. So this is a within-population comparison of who is closer to (or above) their mean.
- Participant 1 has several notable sleep- and circadian-related signals that are associated with higher PSS (PSQI high, extremely short objective sleep, high intradaily variability). However, the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (GAD-7: r ≈ +0.76; NGSE: r ≈ −0.65; BASIS emotional lability very low) point toward substantially lower perceived stress for Participant 1. In other words, Participant 1 is mixed but leans below mean mainly because strong psychological predictors indicate low stress despite pronounced sleep pathology.
- Participant 2 shows a robust, consistent set of low-distress self-report and behavioral indicators (very low depression and trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise, stable sleep timing). These signals are large in magnitude (z-scores often >1) and align strongly with lower PSS. The countervailing evidence for Participant 2 is physiological (elevated mesor and RHR), but those heart-rate metrics have only small correlations with PSS in the sample and could reflect other causes (fitness/metabolic factors or subclinical activation).
- Relative strength of evidence: Participant 2’s protective self-report/behavioral signals are more consistent and larger in standardized effect than Participant 1’s protective signals. Participant 1’s main risk domain is severe sleep disruption (which is important), but the strongest sample predictors (anxiety and self-efficacy) favor lower stress for Participant 1. Overall, Participant 1 appears closer to sample-mean risk for elevated PSS than Participant 2 because Participant 1 carries pronounced sleep/circadian risk markers that are plausibly stress-elevating, whereas Participant 2’s primary stress signals are modest physiological deviations with small PSS correlations and are outweighed by strong low-stress self-report.

- Objective and subjective sleep/circadian disturbance: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), very late median sleep start (~03:38), elevated night-to-night sleep start variability (sleep start SD z = +0.88), reduced interdaily stability (z = -0.82), and increased intradaily variability (z = +0.88). Those sleep/circadian features are noted to correlate positively with PSS in this dataset (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16).
- Elevated evening physiological arousal: large positive mean heart-rate deviations in the evening (e.g., 7–8 pm deviation z ≈ +1.53), which is highlighted as associated with higher PSS.
- Low health satisfaction and lower momentary happiness: health satisfaction z = -1.53 and current happiness z ≈ -0.53, both described as co-occurring with higher perceived stress.
- Convergent mechanistic plausibility: the report emphasizes that the circadian fragmentation and evening arousal plausibly drive subjective sleep disturbance and therefore contribute to perceived stress.
- Commented overall inference: the study text explicitly interprets the participant as “near the mean” with a modest tilt toward “slightly above the mean” PSS (population mean 21.63).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Subjective sleep complaints: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.42), so this could raise PSS relative to peers.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations: larger negative early-morning HR deviations (2–6am) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These are described as a modest possible contributor.
- However, these are comparatively limited/isolated signals and the summary explicitly concludes the participant’s PSS is below the sample mean (population mean 21.5).

Comparative weighting and interpretation (accounting for within-sample baselines)
- Strength and number of signals: Participant 1’s indicators of higher PSS are primarily sleep/circadian irregularity and evening arousal, but their correlations with PSS are relatively small (r ≈ 0.16–0.18). Participant 1 also has several protective factors (below-average CES-D and STAI, good exercise/socializing, low resting HR) that temper the stress inference.
- Participant 2 shows a strong cluster of protective, highly predictive indicators against high PSS: very high self-efficacy (NGSE z = +1.79; NGSE–PSS r = -0.60), very low GAD-7 (z = -1.38; GAD–PSS r = +0.75), low interpersonal/emotional problems (large negative z-scores), and robust circadian regularity and very low resting HR (interdaily stability and amplitude z ≈ +1.8–1.9; RHR z = -2.23). Those protective markers have large correlations with PSS (noted in the text) and are strongly weighted in the summary interpretation.
- The main counter-evidence for Participant 2 is subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and modest nocturnal HR associations; these are important but described as isolated and of smaller predictive weight compared with the large protective signals.
- Both descriptions are explicitly interpreted by the study authors: Participant 1 ≈ near mean with a modest tilt above; Participant 2 ≈ below the mean. Given that both are described relative to their own sample means, the net picture is that Participant 1 is at-or-slightly-above average stress while Participant 2 is below average stress in their respective cohorts.

Decision
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS (more perceived stress) relative to Participant 2.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Severe anxiety: GAD‑7 = 16.5 (z = 1.25). In this dataset GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r = 0.81), making this a high-weight indicator of elevated perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 16 (z = 0.83; “Disturbed Sleep”), a strong correlate of PSS (r = 0.51).

- Pain/interference: PEG/PAPAS elevated (PEG ~5.8, PAPAS 61), which correlate moderately with PSS (r ~0.44–0.48).
- Marked physiological arousal: resting HR 79.8 bpm (z = 1.53), mesor z ≈ 1.49 — larger elevations than Participant 1 and consistent with sustained stress-related activation.
- Severe objective/recorded sleep disruption: wearable median sleep very short (2 h 31 min, z ≈ −0.97) plus late and highly variable sleep timing (sleep start ≈ 01:37, SD 254 min, z ≈ 0.98). Subjective and objective sleep disturbance largely concordant.
- Holistic note: multiple high-weight, converging indicators (severe anxiety, poor sleep, low self-efficacy, elevated HR) point strongly to above-mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective study means. The population means are similar (21.64 vs 21.12), so absolute mean differences do not meaningfully change the comparison.
- Strength and number of high-weight predictors favor Participant 2:
  - Participant 2 has a severe anxiety score (GAD‑7) that is strongly correlated with PSS in the study (r = 0.81). Participant 1’s anxiety marker (STAI‑Trait) is only mildly elevated (z ≈ +0.27).
  - Participant 2 shows larger physiological elevation (resting HR/mesor z ≈ +1.5) than Participant 1 (HR/mesor z ≈ +0.74), indicating greater autonomic activation.
  - Participant 2’s self-report burden (PSQI = 16, severe; and low NGSE) and additional functional stressors (pain/interference) represent multiple, strongly PSS‑linked domains. Participant 1 has elevated PSQI but lower depressive symptoms, better functioning (GPA), limited substance use, and social/exercise engagement that mitigate overall stress inference.
  - Several of Participant 2’s indicators are either more extreme in magnitude or have higher correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD‑7, NGSE) than the corresponding indicators for Participant 1.
- Potential measurement caveats (noted in the descriptions) do not overturn the pattern: even if Participant 2’s wearable sleep undercounts true sleep, subjective PSQI and anxiety strongly corroborate high sleep-related and emotional distress.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 presents a larger number of high-weight, concordant indicators of elevated perceived stress (severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, low self‑efficacy, pain interference, and substantially elevated resting HR), whereas Participant 1 shows a mixed profile with some stress-related features but also multiple protective/mitigating factors and generally more moderate elevations.

- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE below mean; NGSE r = −0.66) and moderate pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS), both associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular arousal (resting HR Z ≈ 1.53; mesor Z ≈ 1.49), consistent with sustained stress.
- Wearable indicators of short, late, and somewhat irregular sleep (median sleep ≈2.5 h; late median start; start-time variability), which concord with subjective disturbance.
- Some functional/emotional lability and small elevations on substance-related items that can accompany stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Very high trait anxiety (STAI trait Z ≈ 2.05), a salient predictor of PSS in that sample.
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ 0.9) and low self-esteem/happiness (RSES/happiness Zs negative), which accompany higher PSS.
- Elevated cardiovascular baseline (resting HR and MESOR Z ≈ 1.1–1.2).
- Pronounced circadian disruption: very low amplitude (Z ≈ −2.13) and very low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −2.06), both associated with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Very large variability in sleep timing (start-time SD Z ≈ 2.89) and late median sleep timing; PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7).
- Convergent physiological and circadian signals pointing to dysregulated daily structure tied to higher perceived stress.

Comparative considerations (within each participant’s population frame)
- Magnitude of deviations: Participant 2 shows multiple large-magnitude deviations (Zs ≈ ±2 or greater) across trait anxiety and circadian metrics (amplitude, interdaily stability, sleep-timing variability). Participant 1 shows several concerning features but most Z-scores are more moderate (generally |Z| ≲ 1.5), except for elevated resting HR and the severe GAD‑7 score (GAD‑7 is highly predictive in P1’s sample).
- Predictor strength in each frame: In Participant 1’s description, GAD‑7 is an especially strong correlate of PSS (r = 0.81), so the severe anxiety is highly weighty for that participant. In Participant 2’s frame, trait anxiety and circadian disruption together provide multiple independent, large signals of elevated PSS.
- Protective/mitigating factors: Participant 1 retains some circadian regularity and a recognizable diurnal HR pattern (mitigating). Participant 2 has preserved functional indicators (strong academic performance, low substance use, some social/exercise) that temper but do not erase the strong anxiety + circadian dysregulation signals.
- Consistency across modalities: Participant 2’s profile contains converging, large-magnitude signals across psychological (trait anxiety, depression) and physiological/circadian domains. Participant 1 has very strong self-report anxiety and sleep disturbance plus elevated HR, but also some physiological regularity that partly mitigates the stress inference.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants are judged in their reports to be above their sample means. Relative to their own populations, Participant 2 exhibits larger, multi-domain deviations (several |Z| > 2) especially in trait anxiety and circadian dysregulation, which in that dataset are linked to higher PSS. Participant 1 has a very strong single-domain predictor (GAD‑7 highly correlated with PSS) and clear sleep disturbance, but overall the magnitudes of deviation and the number of independent, large-effect indicators are greater for Participant 2.

- Low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.41), also modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ -0.12).
- Large evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., +22 bpm at 10–11 pm, Z = 2.46) and some early-morning positive deviations; evening physiological arousal is linked to rumination/work-related stress and shows modest positive correlation with PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, above clinical cut-off), a known correlate of higher perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.2), modestly associated with greater PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Markedly elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53), which has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.65), making it a potent risk signal.
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 12) and PSQI’s strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.50), indicating a domain strongly linked to perceived stress.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (1–4 AM aggregated increases) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), consistent with overnight arousal and reduced recovery.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (resting HR z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18), indicating higher baseline cardiovascular tone that often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Extremely atypical sleep quantity/timing (median 12 h, z = 2.26) and very large night-to-night variability (SD z = 2.38), patterns often seen with dysregulation tied to stress-related processes.

Comparative reasoning in the within-population frame
- Both profiles are characterized as near their respective study means, but Participant 1 is described as “near the mean, leaning slightly below,” whereas Participant 2 is described as “near the mean” with meaningful signs that could support a modest elevation in stress for specific domains.
- The strength of associations (correlation magnitudes) matters: Participant 2’s prominent risk indicators (emotional lability r ≈ 0.65; PSQI r ≈ 0.50; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.36–0.41) are more strongly tied to PSS in that study than Participant 1’s risk indicators (IV r ≈ 0.17; evening HR deviations and resting HR correlations are modest, r ≈ 0.14–small).  
- Participant 1 has multiple relatively strong protective signals (low depression and trait-anxiety, high self-esteem, regular exercise, adequate & regular sleep duration, low resting HR) that the profile explicitly judges to tilt the overall inference to slight below-mean stress.
- Participant 2 has several strong domain-specific risk signals (emotional lability, severe subjective sleep disturbance, nocturnal and baseline HR elevations, extreme sleep instability) that, even though offset by some protective domains (low pain, good interpersonal functioning, mild anxiety), are more directly and strongly associated with higher PSS in that sample.

Balance of evidence and decision
- On balance, Participant 2 displays a cluster of indicators that are both more numerous (for stress-related domains) and more strongly correlated with PSS in their study population than the comparatively weaker risk signals present for Participant 1. Participant 1’s profile contains stronger overall protective features and is explicitly characterized as slightly below the population mean, whereas Participant 2’s profile contains domain-specific signals that plausibly push perceived stress modestly above their population mean.

- Elevated tonic/evening cardiovascular arousal: mesor z = 2.01, resting HR z = 1.62, and pronounced evening HR deviations. Physiological arousal supports inference of elevated stress.
- Low health satisfaction (z = -2.03) and low BMI (17.8) add to an overall distress signal (even if weakly correlated with PSS).
- Although there are protective signals (adequate objective sleep duration, strong interdaily stability, high social time, low substance use), the convergent high depressive/anxiety scores plus physiological arousal are emphasized in the summary as outweighing those buffers and leading to an inference above the population mean (mean PSS = 21.59).

- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability z = 0.53) is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.65) and is identified as a likely contributor to perceived stress.
- Substantial nocturnal HR elevations (1–4 AM) and elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18). Nighttime HR deviations have moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41) in this dataset.
- Marked sleep abnormalities on wearables (very long median sleep 12 hr, z = 2.26; huge night-to-night variability z = 2.38). Even though wearable sleep measures have weak direct correlations with PSS here, such extreme dysregulation plausibly relates to stress-related disruption.
- Subjective sleep problems (PSQI raw = 12) are consistent with higher stress given PSQI’s moderate correlation with PSS (r = 0.50), though the PSQI z reported is modestly negative relative to the study population.

Protective/contraindicating evidence for Participant 2
- Lower pain burden (PEG-3 z ≈ -1.39; PAPAS z ≈ -1.24) and relatively preserved interpersonal functioning (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = -1.77) — both are associated with lower PSS in this sample.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 6; z = -0.59) despite GAD’s strong correlation with PSS — here anxiety is not elevated.
- Several circadian/cardiac metrics have weak correlations with PSS in this sample, reducing confidence that physiological dysregulation alone implies higher PSS.
- The study summary concludes the participant is best characterized as near the population mean (mean PSS = 20.96), with domain-specific elevations possible.

Comparative weighing (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Strength and directness of predictors: Participant 1 shows very large psychological signals (CES-D and STAI with z ≈ 1.6–2.0) that are directly and moderately correlated with PSS in that study. Participant 2’s strongest PSS predictor is emotional lability (z ≈ 0.53) and nocturnal HR elevations (moderate effect), but these z-scores and their net impact are smaller and counterbalanced by notable protective factors (low pain, strong interpersonal function, only mild anxiety).
- Physiological evidence: Both participants have elevated heart-rate metrics, but Participant 1’s mesor and resting HR z-scores are larger and include pronounced evening spikes tied to subjective distress; Participant 2’s elevations are more nocturnal and are balanced by domain protections.
- Overall inference reported by each case summary: Participant 1 is explicitly concluded to be above their study mean PSS; Participant 2 is characterized as near their study mean. Those stated inferences align with the relative strength of risk signals in each case.

Decision
Given the stronger, more direct, and multiple convergent predictors of higher perceived stress in Participant 1 (notably large depressive and anxiety scores plus elevated baseline/evening HR), versus Participant 2’s mixed profile with weaker net elevation after protective factors are considered, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Strong elevations on depression and trait-anxiety scales (CES‑D = 32, z ≈ +1.95; STAI = 54, z ≈ +1.25). Both scales are positively correlated with PSS in this sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), so these are direct indicators pointing toward above‑mean perceived stress.
- Low self‑esteem and low self‑rated happiness (large negative z’s) and a PSQI > 5 (score = 6) — subjective distress signals that align with higher PSS.
- Evening physiological arousal (elevated HR 9–11 PM) and a late habitual sleep onset (~01:21 AM) that could reflect heightened evening stress/arousal.
- Slightly elevated alcohol use (z ≈ +1.0) which can accompany coping under stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe and objectively corroborated sleep problems: PSQI = 13.5 (disturbed), median wearable sleep ≈ 3 h/night (extremely short), and very large night‑to‑night variability in sleep start (SD z = +2.82). Sleep measures in this sample correlate strongly with PSS (PSQI r = 0.50), and the objective extremes are potent risk signals.
- Elevated anxiety/emotional instability: GAD‑7 = 9 (and GAD‑7 correlates with PSS at r = 0.78 in this sample); BASIS‑24 emotional lability elevated (and r ≈ 0.68). These very high correlations mean these measures are particularly informative about PSS here.
- Substance‑related problems (BASIS‑24 substance z ≈ +1.75) and some pain interference—both associate positively with PSS in the sample.
- Circadian/HR rhythm instability (low interdaily stability z ≈ −1.42, low amplitude), adding objective support for dysregulation that aligns with higher PSS.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Strength of predictive signals: Participant 2’s strongest indicators (GAD‑7, PSQI, emotional lability, extreme objective sleep deficits and timing variability) have large sample correlations with PSS (r’s as high as 0.78 and 0.68) and include extreme z‑scores (e.g., sleep timing variability z ≈ +2.82, median sleep ≈ 3 h). Those facts give Participant 2 very strong, convergent evidence for high perceived stress.
- By contrast, Participant 1’s principal signals for higher PSS (CES‑D, STAI) are present and moderately elevated (CES‑D z ≈ +1.95, STAI z ≈ +1.25) but, in this dataset, they have smaller correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.29–0.32). Moreover, Participant 1 has multiple objective/behavioral resilience markers (high interdaily stability, consistent ~7+ h sleep, low intradaily variability, frequent group exercise, low resting HR) that plausibly moderate perceived stress.
- Population variability: Participant 1’s study SD for PSS is small (SD = 3.68), meaning deviations in strong predictors could map onto noticeable PSS differences; however, the magnitudes and predictive strength of Participant 2’s sleep and anxiety signals — and their objective corroboration — outweigh Participant 1’s mixed profile given the much stronger correlations with PSS in Participant 2’s dataset.
- Net balance: Participant 2 shows multiple, highly PSS‑predictive, and sometimes extreme concordant indicators (especially sleep and anxiety) that are only partially offset by high self‑efficacy and lower resting HR. Participant 1 shows elevated mood/anxiety self‑reports but also several objective resilience markers that reduce the net inferred PSS.

Conclusion
Given the relative strength, extremity, and PSS‑predictive value of Participant 2’s disturbances (notably severe objective and subjective sleep loss/irregularity and anxiety measures with very high sample correlations to PSS), Participant 2 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

3,78783,13,21,"Reasons Participant 1 might have higher PSS
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) and this score is clinically meaningful.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG ~4.9; PAPAS ~50). These measures are above the population median and correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which could reduce perceived social support even if its direct correlation with PSS is small.
- Slightly elevated physiological arousal (mesor and resting HR Z ≈ +1.16 and +1.22), which may reflect increased basal autonomic activation in some stressed individuals.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (context for weighting)
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.41), and NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.63) — a major protective factor.
- Very regular circadian/behavioral rhythms (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, strong 24-h autocorrelation), associated with resilience.
- Low emotional lability (Z = −0.67) and minimal substance problems (Z = −1.62).
- Long objective sleep duration and regular sleep timing despite poor subjective sleep.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS
- Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 43) and low current happiness; STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 8) combined with late median sleep start (~02:51), very large night-to-night sleep-start variability (z ≈ +1.99), and frequent napping (z ≈ +2.23) — sleep timing irregularity and fragmentation associate with higher PSS.
- Circadian fragmentation signs (elevated intradaily variability, low interdaily stability) that correlate positively with PSS.
- Low health satisfaction and low current happiness (behavioral/well-being signals that co-occur with higher PSS).

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (context for weighting)
- Regular exercise (≥3×/week), considerable social time, and other protective behaviors.
- Low resting HR and relatively high heart-rate amplitude (z ≈ −0.64 and +0.49), which correlate with lower PSS.
- Moderate-to-high self-esteem and non-elevated depressive symptoms.

Comparative, within-population framing and overall weighting
- Each summary is framed relative to its own sample mean: Participant 1 is characterized as near or slightly below their population mean (mean PSS = 21.38), whereas Participant 2 is characterized as above their population mean (mean PSS = 21.62).
- The protective factors for Participant 1 (especially the strong inverse predictor NGSE and pronounced circadian regularity) are described as large/strong correlations with PSS in this sample and are judged to outweigh the participant’s risk indicators, leading to an inference near or slightly below the sample mean.
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple converging risk signals (trait anxiety, poor and highly irregular sleep timing, circadian fragmentation, low happiness/health satisfaction) that the summary explicitly judges to outweigh the participant’s protective factors and to place them above their sample mean.
- The two population means are very similar, so the critical information is the direction and strength of predictors within each participant’s description. Given that Participant 1 is judged near/below their mean and Participant 2 is judged above their mean, and given the relative strength of the protective factor (NGSE) for Participant 1 versus the multiple stress-relevant indicators for Participant 2, the balance of evidence points to Participant 2 having the higher perceived stress.

- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12) with very strong sample-level correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.77), making this a high-impact predictor of perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5; z ≈ 1.32) that also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (multiple hourly deviations with z up to ≈1.02) that are positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39), consistent with nocturnal autonomic arousal/poor recovery.
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) and high emotional lability (BASIS-24 correlated strongly with PSS), both traits associated with higher perceived stress (self-efficacy r ≈ -0.66; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68).
- Elevated substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ 1.5) may reflect stress-related behaviors (even if its direct correlation with PSS is weak).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 46; z ≈ 0.46), a consistent psychological marker associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Physiological/circadian dysregulation: elevated resting HR (66.1 bpm; z ≈ 0.95), high intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.65), low circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.25) and reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.9). These markers are associated with higher PSS in the sample (though correlations are modest, r ≈ 0.14–0.16).
- Late sleep timing and lower momentary happiness (modest associations with higher PSS).

Factors in Participant 2 that mitigate higher PSS
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; z ≈ -0.8) and near-average depressive symptoms (CES-D ≈ 14, z ≈ 0.07).
- Protective psychosocial features (higher self-esteem, good academic performance, low substance use), which temper the likely magnitude of perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both participants are judged in their summaries to be above their respective population means (P1: above mean PSS; P2: somewhat above mean PSS). However, the predictors in the two summaries differ in predictive strength and clinical severity.
- Participant 1’s elevated markers (notably GAD-7 and PSQI) have larger sample-level correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; PSQI r ≈ 0.45) and clinically notable magnitudes (PSQI z ≈ 1.32, nocturnal HR deviations z ≈ 1.0). Multiple high-impact, convergent signals (strong anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, nocturnal autonomic arousal, reduced self-efficacy/emotional lability) point toward a substantial elevation in perceived stress relative to that study’s mean.
- Participant 2 shows clear physiological/circadian risk signals (intradaily variability z ≈ 1.65, resting HR z ≈ 0.95, low amplitude z ≈ -1.25), but the sample-level correlations of these markers with PSS are more modest (r generally ≈ 0.14–0.16). Crucially, Participant 2 also has several protective/neutral factors (good PSQI, near‑normal depression score, higher self-esteem, academic success, low substance use) that the summary explicitly notes temper the likely PSS elevation.
- In short: P1’s profile includes multiple high‑impact psychological predictors highly correlated with PSS (especially anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) plus corroborating nocturnal autonomic signs; P2’s profile is more mixed with physiological/circadian disruptions but weaker correlations to PSS and stronger psychosocial/sleep protections.

Conclusion (which participant likely has the higher PSS)
- Based on the balance of evidence (strength of predictors, correlation magnitudes, clinical severity), Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Summary label: The provided synthesis explicitly concludes the participant is “above the population mean” (population mean PSS = 21.21).
- Strong risk signals with moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS:
  - Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11.5; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.48).
  - Extremely short objective sleep (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 30 min; very large deviation).
  - Markedly delayed sleep timing (median sleep onset ≈ 03:37 AM), suggesting biologically suboptimal sleep phase.
  - Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z = +1.33; PAPAS Z = +0.43), and pain scales correlate with PSS (~0.5).
  - Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (late-night/early-morning HR Zs up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian amplitude/autocorrelation—physiological patterns linked to higher PSS.
- Multimodal convergence: subjective sleep, objective sleep, pain, and nocturnal physiology all point in the same (higher-stress) direction.
- Caveats/protective signals (reduce certainty but do not override): low anxiety (GAD-7 low, Z ≈ −0.85), high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86), low emotional lability (Z ≈ −0.97). These are strong protective correlates (some with large sample correlations to PSS) but described as insufficient to fully counterbalance the large sleep/pain/physiologic abnormalities.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Summary label: The provided synthesis explicitly concludes the participant is “below the population mean” (population mean PSS = 21.65), but it also notes some signals that modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Wearable/circadian signals that, in the sample, are modestly associated with higher PSS:
  - Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.07) and reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87).
  - Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.74) and attenuated rhythm amplitude (Z ≈ −1.03).
  - Some hourly HR deviations (e.g., pronounced morning peak Z = 3.07 at 6–7am) that have small positive sample correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23).
- These physiological circadian irregularities suggest possible fragmentation/irregularity that, if interpreted alone, could indicate modestly higher perceived stress.
- Caveats/protective signals (strong and numerous): very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI Z = −1.71; CES‑D Z = −1.07), good subjective and objective sleep (median 8h11m, PSQI = 5), high happiness/health satisfaction/self‑esteem, frequent exercise, low substance use, and low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.65). The synthesis treats the circadian signals as smaller-magnitude and insufficient to indicate higher-than-average PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and balance of evidence
- Each description is anchored to its own study’s mean PSS. Participant 1 is interpreted as above their study mean; Participant 2 is interpreted as below their study mean. The two study means are similar (21.21 vs 21.65), so cross-study baseline differences are minimal.
- Magnitude and convergence:
  - Participant 1: multiple large-magnitude abnormalities (very short sleep, high PSQI, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations) that converge across modalities and are tied to moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS. Although strong self-report protective factors exist, they are described as not fully offsetting the large objective/subjective stress signals.
  - Participant 2: many robust protective self-report indicators and favorable sleep that strongly point to below-mean PSS; the opposing signals are primarily physiological circadian irregularities whose associations with PSS are smaller in magnitude and treated as insufficient to overturn the low-stress inference.
- Overall judgment: Participant 1 shows stronger, larger, and multi-modal risk indicators of elevated perceived stress relative to their cohort mean, whereas Participant 2 shows primarily protective indicators with only modest physiological countersignals. Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher PSS.

- Convergence of sleep, pain, and nocturnal arousal signals provides multiple concordant risk indicators above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean):
- Very large depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 42; Z ≈ +2.99), a strong indicator of greater subjective stress in the sample.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +1.75), another robust correlate of PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +2.9), which commonly accompanies higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate (68.6 bpm; Z ≈ +1.24) and blunted nocturnal HR suppression—objective autonomic signs of higher arousal.
- Marked social withdrawal and extreme sedentary screen time (socializing Z ≈ -2.20; large positive Zs for screen leisure), behaviors associated with reduced stress buffering and higher perceived stress.
- Multiple large-magnitude affective and behavioral signals converge above the population mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Participant 1’s strongest stress-related signals are severe objective sleep restriction, poor subjective sleep, elevated pain, and nocturnal physiological arousal. However, several potent protective self-report signals (low GAD‑7; high self‑efficacy; low emotional lability) are well correlated with lower PSS in that study and reduce the overall inferred PSS elevation. The net judgment in-frame was “above the mean,” but with moderate confidence because of these countervailing buffers.
- Participant 2’s profile contains extremely large affective symptom elevations (particularly CES‑D nearly +3 SD) and elevated trait anxiety, plus poor subjective sleep and objective signs of higher autonomic arousal and social withdrawal. Although Participant 2 has some protective signals (adequate total sleep time, regular circadian autocorrelation, frequent exercise), the magnitude of the depressive/anxiety and social-withdrawal signals is large and was judged to place them above their study mean with substantial concern.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- The extremity and breadth of Participant 2’s affective symptom elevations (CES‑D Z ≈ +2.99; STAI Z ≈ +1.75), combined with elevated resting HR and marked social withdrawal, represent larger and more canonical correlates of high PSS than the primary risk signals in Participant 1.
- Participant 1 has severe objective sleep loss and nocturnal arousal, which are important stress indicators, but the participant’s strong protective self-report factors (notably low anxiety and high self‑efficacy) are meaningful and reduce the likelihood that their PSS is as high, relative to their cohort, as Participant 2’s appears relative to theirs.
- Therefore, on balance and within each study’s frame, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Somatic/functional burdens (pain interference PEG-3 mean = 5.0; r ≈ 0.44) that tend to increase perceived stress.
- Some physiological/behavioral signals consistent with elevated arousal: elevated resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ +1.2–1.3) and high night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.12). These also support higher stress, although wearable–PSS correlations are weaker overall.

- Trait anxiety (STAI ≈ 41) which correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), and very low momentary happiness (Z ≈ -1.61) that is associated with greater distress (happiness–PSS r ≈ -0.20).
- Late sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:50) and shorter wearable-measured sleep (median ≈ 6 h 46 m, z ≈ -0.51) — later/shorter sleep can contribute to greater perceived stress or reduced coping.
- Slightly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.32) which has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Some behavioral patterns (high video-game time Z ≈ +1.71, limited reading) that could reflect coping/avoidance associated with stress in some contexts.
- However: these signals are described as modest and the analytic description weighs them as weaker than the objective indicators of resilience.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1 is described as having multiple, strongly correlated self-report risk factors (anxiety, very poor PSQI, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) that in this dataset show large correlations with PSS (many r-values > 0.4 and several ≈ 0.6–0.77).

The correlations linking P2’s elevated rhythms and low RHR to lower PSS are small-to-modest but consistent.

- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 10) — in this dataset anxiety has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), making this a powerful indicator of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5; disturbed sleep; r ≈ 0.49 with PSS).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 score z ≈ +0.93; r ≈ 0.67 with PSS).
- Lower general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.62; NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS, r ≈ −0.66).
- Pain interference and somatic burden (PEG‑3 average 5.0; r ≈ 0.44), which tend to raise stress appraisal.
- Wearable/physiology consistent with higher tonic arousal: relatively high resting HR (z ≈ +1.31), higher MESOR (z ≈ +1.19).
- High night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.12) and late sleep timing — both frequently associated with higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each description is explicitly framed against its own population mean. Participant 1’s interpretation in that frame is “near or slightly below” their population mean (21.6), because the sleep/circadian risk signals are offset by multiple strong protective signals (low depressive and trait anxiety scores, high self‑esteem and happiness, low resting HR, regular exercise, good functioning). The strongest single stress signals for Participant 1 are sleep/circadian disturbances, but these are moderate and counterbalanced by several indicators strongly associated with lower PSS.
- Participant 2’s description concludes they are likely above their population mean (21.08). Crucially, multiple self-report predictors that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (anxiety, emotional lability, low self-efficacy, poor PSQI) converge on elevated perceived stress. Several wearable signals also align with higher stress (higher resting HR, sleep variability), and the strongest predictors in this dataset are present and positive for stress in Participant 2.
- The predictive strength differs: Participant 2’s elevated self-report measures include variables with large correlations to PSS in that sample (especially GAD‑7), whereas Participant 1’s higher-risk signals are largely sleep/circadian and are countervailed by strong protective self-reports and physiological markers with clear associations to lower stress.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows multiple, converging risk factors that are strongly linked to higher PSS in their study sample (particularly anxiety, emotional lability, low self-efficacy, and very poor subjective sleep), and some physiological corroboration (high resting HR, sleep variability).
- Participant 1 shows some sleep/circadian risk signals but stronger and numerous protective indicators (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem/happiness, low resting HR, good functioning) that lead to an inference of PSS near or slightly below the sample mean.

- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6) and short median sleep (6 h 3 min; z ≈ −1.41), both of which are associated with higher PSS in the sample.

- Objective extreme sleep impairment and irregularity (median nightly sleep 2 h 38 min; z ≈ −0.94, and sleep onset SD z ≈ +1.3), indicating severe short and unstable sleep.
- Marked nocturnal physiological arousal (overnight heart-rate deviations with z up to ≈ +1.59), and those nocturnal HR elevations have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically meaningful anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 10); anxiety measures in this dataset have a very strong relationship with PSS (r ≈ 0.78), so even moderate GAD-7 elevation is a strong predictor of higher PSS.
- Pain-related interference modestly elevated (PAPAS z ≈ +0.19), and pain correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the strength and number of high-PSS signals differ.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators are moderate in magnitude and involve factors with modest correlations to PSS (trait anxiety r ≈ 0.31; sleep variability and IV with small-to-moderate correlations). Several protective signals (low resting HR, higher circadian amplitude, low substance use, above-average momentary happiness) partially offset the stress-related signals. Most z-scores for P1 are below or around ±1.2 and correlations cited are generally modest.
- Participant 2 shows more severe sleep pathology (PSQI z = +1.0, extreme short sleep and very high sleep-onset variability) and clearer nocturnal physiological arousal (HR z up to ≈ +1.6). Crucially, several of Participant 2’s elevated measures (GAD-7, PSQI, pain) have relatively strong correlations with PSS in this dataset (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78; PSQI r ≈ 0.47; pain r ≈ 0.48). Although Participant 2 does have protective traits (self-efficacy and low emotional lability), those protections appear insufficient to fully counterbalance the pronounced sleep disruption and nocturnal arousal signals, which are strongly linked to higher PSS here.

Overall weighing of evidence
- Participant 2’s profile contains more severe and more strongly PSS-linked signals (severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance, substantial nocturnal HR elevation, and anxiety symptoms that map strongly onto PSS in this sample).
- Participant 1’s signals indicating higher stress are more moderate and are partially balanced by several protective physiological and affective indicators.
- Therefore, on balance and within the respective population frames provided, Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

24,67177,33,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have higher PSS
- Elevated trait affective symptoms: STAI Z = +0.46 and CES‑D Z = +0.28; both positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28), so these push toward higher PSS.
- Poorer subjective sleep: PSQI = 7 (clinically disturbed) and shorter-than-average sleep (≈6 h 54 m, Z = −0.35) with high sleep-start variability (SD = 87 min); subjective sleep complaints correlate positively with PSS in this sample.
- Low positive psychosocial resources: low happiness (Z = −1.61) and lower self‑esteem (RSES Z = −1.01), which are associated with higher PSS.
- Lifestyle/health risk factors: minimal exercise, low socializing, BMI ≈ 30, low health satisfaction — all can contribute to greater perceived stress.
- Mild physiological arousal: resting HR Z ≈ +0.84 (small positive r with PSS ≈ 0.13).

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (protective factors)
- Very strong circadian/physiological regularity: interdaily stability Z = +1.24 and 24-h autocorrelation Z = +1.40; these metrics correlate negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.12 to −0.18) and act as resilience factors.
- Low intradaily variability (Z = −0.74) and moderate-to-high circadian amplitude (Z = +0.82) also associate with lower PSS.
- No alcohol/drug use or napping (strongly negative Zs) — removes common stressors.

Net appraisal for Participant 1
- Overall a mixed profile, but the symptom elevations and lifestyle risks are modest in magnitude; the narrative concludes a likely modest elevation above the population mean (Population mean = 21.61), not extreme.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS
- Very large and highly predictive subjective symptoms:
  - GAD‑7 = 18, Z = +1.51; GAD‑7–PSS correlation r = 0.74 (the single strongest predictor reported). This strongly favors substantially higher PSS.
  - PSQI Z = +1.65 (strong positive r with PSS = 0.43) — severe subjective sleep disturbance.
  - BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z = +1.03 (r with PSS = 0.63).
- Elevated pain/functional interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS elevated), which correlates positively with PSS.
- Lower generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.44) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r = −0.66), indicating fewer coping resources.
- Convergent, high‑effect-size subjective predictors collectively point to pronounced above‑mean perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective factors)
- Preserved circadian/physiological regularity: interdaily stability Z = +0.65 and low intradaily variability Z = −0.59; amplitude Z = +0.56.
- Relatively low resting HR and mesor (Zs ≈ −0.9, −1.35), suggesting lower tonic arousal or better fitness.
- Some hourly HR deviations (deep night troughs, daytime peaks) align with patterns that, in this sample, are associated with lower PSS.

Net appraisal for Participant 2
- Strong, large‑magnitude subjective indicators (especially GAD‑7 and PSQI) with very high correlations to PSS dominate the profile. The wearable-derived protective signals are present but are weaker predictors of PSS here and do not outweigh the strong subjective signal. The narrative concludes likely above the population mean (Population mean = 20.54), and the elevation appears more pronounced than for Participant 1.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both participants are characterized as likely above their respective cohort means, but the magnitude and predictive strength of the signals differ.
- Participant 1’s predictors of higher PSS are modest in Z‑score and have moderate-to-small correlations with PSS; importantly, Participant 1 also shows very strong physiological resilience features that negatively correlate with PSS, which temper the symptom signal.
- Participant 2 shows large symptom elevations (GAD‑7 and PSQI especially) that are tied to very large correlations with PSS (e.g., r = 0.74 for GAD‑7). These subjective measures are both higher in Z‑score magnitude and more strongly predictive of PSS than Participant 1’s symptom signals.
- The small difference in the cohort means (21.61 vs 20.54) does not offset the much stronger symptom signal for Participant 2.

Conclusion
- On balance, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

7,79167,15,10,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Strong indicators of poor sleep and sleep irregularity that correlate with higher PSS in this sample: very short median sleep (4 h 22 m), very large night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 216 min; z = 0.89) and onset (SD = 204 min; z = 0.34), and a very poor subjective PSQI (15.5; z = 0.67). The PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in the dataset (r = 0.53).
- Circadian/rhythm measures pointing to reduced regularity and dampened amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude), consistent with behavioral/physiological patterns that commonly accompany higher perceived stress.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 Interpersonal Relationships z = 2.34), a contextual risk factor that can contribute to ongoing perceived stress.
- Evening elevations in heart-rate deviations and blunted circadian HR amplitude, patterns that often co-occur with stress-related dysregulation.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (protective signs to weigh against the above):
- Very low current anxiety (GAD‑7 z = −1.38), low pain and interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS z = −1.29), and low emotional lability (z = −1.27).
- Near-average self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.07), and lower resting HR/MESOR, which are associated with lower tonic arousal in this sample.
- Overall study summary concluded near the population mean with a modest tilt toward being above it, not an extreme elevation.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity and fragmentation (low interdaily stability z = −1.07, reduced 24-h autocorrelation z = −0.87, elevated intradaily variability z = 0.74, attenuated amplitude z = −1.03) — these features in this sample modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Some hourly HR deviations (notably a strong morning HR peak at 6–7am, Z = 3.07) that show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23), possibly reflecting schedule-related arousal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (strong protective signs):
- Multiple robust self-report indicators strongly associated with low stress: very low trait anxiety (STAI z = −1.71), low depressive symptoms (CES‑D z = −1.07), high happiness (z = 1.64), high health satisfaction (z = 2.05), and elevated self‑esteem (z = 1.24).
- Good sleep quantity and quality (median 8 h 11 m, PSQI = 5, z = −0.8) and healthy behaviors (frequent exercise, low substance use, low sedentary/screen time).
- Low resting HR and lower mesor consistent with higher fitness/lower tonic arousal.
- Overall synthesis concluded PSS below the population mean (population mean = 21.65, SD = 3.63).

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame):
- Participant 1’s strongest signals for higher PSS are objective and subjective sleep disruption and circadian irregularity plus interpersonal strain. However, several clear protective self‑report markers (very low anxiety, low pain) blunt the overall signal, leading to an inference of PSS near the population mean with a modest tilt above it (population mean = 21.29).
- Participant 2 shows a coherent and strong set of protective self-report and behavioral indicators that favor a PSS below their population mean (population mean = 21.65). The wearable circadian irregularities that point toward higher PSS are present but described as smaller-magnitude and not overturning the dominant low‑stress self-report profile.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s sleep disruption (extremely short sleep and high variability) and interpersonal strain are substantial risk signals for higher perceived stress; Participant 2’s physiological irregularities are measurable but explicitly characterized as weaker and partially ambiguous in origin. Participant 2’s strong low-anxiety/low-depression profile and good sleep point clearly below their mean, whereas Participant 1 is only modestly above theirs.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",7,Pain,15,79167,NetHealth,10
7,27306,15,21,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Slightly fragmented circadian rhythm: intradaily variability mildly elevated (Z = +0.32) and reduced interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.24 to −0.36), which in the sample correlate with higher PSS.
- Shorter-than-average median sleep (≈6 h 42 m; Z = −0.6) and moderate night-to-night variability in sleep timing—both factors that modestly associate with increased perceived stress.
- Pronounced daytime HR peaks (large positive Z-scores around 7–8am and 4–5pm) that could reflect concentrated physiological arousal tied to daily demands; some of those hourly deviations show small positive correlations with PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; z = 0.67) and very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 m) with large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD z = 0.89; sleep onset SD z = 0.34). In this dataset PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53), making sleep disturbance a strong stress-related signal.
- Reduced circadian regularity and blunted amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, cosinor amplitude z ≈ −0.84), patterns that commonly co-occur with elevated stress.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = +2.34), indicating notable social stressors that—while weakly correlated with PSS in the sample—are contextually likely to increase perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing
- Participant 1’s stress-relevant indicators are mostly modest and many point toward lower stress relative to their population mean (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, good subjective sleep, low resting HR, regular exercise). The circadian/sleep risk factors present are small-to-moderate in magnitude and have relatively weak correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Participant 2 shows a cluster of stronger stress-related signals centered on severe/very short and irregular sleep (objective + subjective), a blunted circadian rhythm, and marked interpersonal strain. The PSQI–PSS correlation in this dataset is moderate, so the participant’s very poor sleep is a comparatively potent indicator of higher perceived stress within their study population.
- Although Participant 2 also has notable protective signs (very low GAD-7, low pain, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR), the severity of sleep disturbance and circadian disruption—plus interpersonal strain—are more directly and strongly linked to higher PSS in the provided correlations than the modest circadian/sleep deviations observed for Participant 1.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: overall profile more consistent with PSS at-or-below their study mean.
- Participant 2: overall profile leans toward PSS at-or-slightly-above their study mean, driven primarily by severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance and reduced circadian regularity.

  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63; r with PSS = 0.66).

  - Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r = -0.65).
- Wearable physiological/circadian signals consistent with hyperarousal or dysregulation:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.2) indicating higher tonic cardiovascular activation.
  - Reduced diurnal amplitude, elevated intradaily variability, and low interdaily stability consistent with blunted/fragmented circadian rhythm.
  - Pronounced early-morning HR elevations (1–8 AM hours) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).
- Objective sleep behavior consistent with stress-related disruption:
  - Extremely short median nightly sleep (median 1 h 39 min; Z = -1.27) and very late median sleep start (~04:36 AM).
  - Presence of naps and pattern suggesting chronically limited nighttime sleep rather than wide variability.
- Convergent evidence: multiple independent modalities (subjective symptom scales with high PSS correlations + physiological/circadian signs) point toward higher perceived stress for this participant.
- Mitigating points (temper interpretation): anxiety level is mild rather than severe; some wearable-to-PSS correlations are weak or inconsistent; substance use is low.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.64)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (meets threshold for disturbed sleep), which is commonly associated with higher perceived stress even if objective sleep looks good.
- Some wearable markers of episodic arousal / within-day irregularity:
  - Elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.95; r with PSS ≈ 0.17) suggesting more fragmented within-day physiology.
  - Pronounced hourly HR deviations at midday and late evening (z-scores 2.1–3.1) that could reflect episodic arousal or misalignment; some of these hours show weak positive correlations with PSS.
- Slightly muted momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which modestly associates with higher PSS.
- These signals are relatively limited in scope and have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS in the sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators are numerous and include the measures with the strongest dataset correlations to PSS (especially GAD-7 r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, low self-efficacy r = -0.65). Wearable and sleep metrics largely align with those subjective signals (e.g., elevated resting HR/MESOR, nocturnal HR elevation, blunted amplitude, extremely short and late objective sleep).
- Participant 2’s profile is dominated by protective signals relative to that study’s population mean (low CES-D and STAI-Trait, high self-esteem, robust objective sleep, low resting HR, good interdaily stability). The signals that could push PSS upward (PSQI, intradaily variability, hourly HR spikes) are fewer, episodic, and generally have weaker correlations with PSS in the dataset.
- In short, Participant 1 shows multiple strong, convergent predictors of elevated perceived stress (including the strongest-correlating measures in the dataset), whereas Participant 2 shows mostly protective indicators with a few weaker, episodic indicators of stress.

Weighted conclusion
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS score (i.e., worse overall perceived stress) relative to their respective study population.

- Strong subjective indicators tightly linked to PSS: GAD‑7 = 8 (mild anxiety) with very high correlation to PSS (r = 0.77); elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 0.63; r = 0.66); low self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44; r = -0.65); disturbed sleep on PSQI (score 13; r = 0.49). These measures are both substantively deviant and strongly correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Wearable physiology consistent with hyperarousal and circadian dysregulation: elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.2), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ -1.05), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.07), and early‑morning HR elevations that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).
- Objective sleep timing/quantity consistent with stress-related disruption: extremely short median nightly sleep (1 h 39 m; Z ≈ -1.27), very late sleep onset (~04:36 AM), presence of naps — overall pattern consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and higher perceived stress.
- Multiple independent lines (subjective symptoms with high PSS correlations + physiological/circadian indicators) converge to support above‑mean perceived stress.

Mitigating notes for Participant 1
- Anxiety is mild rather than moderate/severe; some wearable‑PSS correlations are weak or inconsistent; substance‑use score low; self‑efficacy not extremely low. Possible measurement artifacts (very short wearable sleep) are noted.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean of 21.6)
- Wearable-derived circadian/sleep irregularity that can associate with higher stress: very late median sleep start (02:54), modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m; Z ≈ -0.76), high night-to-night sleep variability (SD 172 min; Z = 1.62), elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (Z = 1.30), low 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.87), and slightly elevated naps (Z = 1.49). These metrics have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.13–0.15), so they provide some evidence toward higher perceived stress risk.
- These objective irregularities could contribute to elevated perceived stress if persistent or if subjective wellbeing changes.

Mitigating notes for Participant 2
- Strong subjective and behavioral indicators of low distress: very low depressive symptoms (CES‑D z = -0.86), low trait anxiety (STAI z = -0.62), high self‑esteem and happiness (z = 0.82 and 1.64), good PSQI (score 4, z = -1.26), low substance use, regular sport, high interpersonal trust (z = 2.75). These subjective/behavioral measures are robust and argue for below‑mean perceived stress.
- Most physiological hourly HR deviations have very small correlations with PSS; resting HR and MESOR are near average.

Comparative weighing (within each study frame)
- Participant 1 shows multiple strong subjective predictors of PSS that are highly correlated with PSS in that study (notably anxiety and emotional lability), plus concordant physiological/circadian signs of hyperarousal. The evidence for above‑mean PSS is multi-modal and anchored by high‑correlation subjective measures.
- Participant 2’s elevated‑stress signals are primarily objective circadian/sleep irregularities that have only small correlations with PSS in that study, whereas subjective and behavioral measures decisively indicate below‑mean perceived stress.
- Therefore, relative to their respective population means and based on the strength and convergence of indicators, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait Z = +1.06), a measure that correlates reasonably with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = +0.38), also positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = +1.05) and objectively late, short sleep (median 5 h 58 min, sleep-start ~02:25, sleep-duration Z ≈ −1.52), which clinically cohere with higher stress.  
- Circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = +0.46; 24-hr autocorrelation Z = −0.19) and some elevated heart-rate indicators (mesor Z ≈ +0.95, resting HR Z ≈ +0.47, pronounced evening HR deviation Z ≈ +1.69) that are associated in this sample with higher PSS.  
- Multiple of the above measures have known positive correlations with PSS in the sample (anxiety, depressive symptoms, PSQI, intradaily variability, some HR features), supporting an inference above the population mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 20.33)
- Extremely high anxiety (GAD-7 Z = +2.04, “severe”), and this measure correlates strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.71) — a very strong driver toward higher PSS.  
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +1.49) and dramatic objective sleep restriction/instability (median 3 h 42 min, night-to-night SD ≈ 173 min) — far more extreme sleep disruption than Participant 1.  
- Large elevations in pain/interference (PAPAS/PEG Z ≈ +2.28) and emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability Z ≈ +2.42), both severe signals that align with higher perceived stress.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), which likely amplifies perceived stress; several of these measures (anxiety, PSQI, pain, emotional lability) have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS.  
- Wearable circadian markers show fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.15) and dampened rhythms (amplitude/mesor Zs negative), plus nocturnal HR deviations that have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51) — physiological corroboration of nocturnal arousal/delayed downregulation.

Comparative considerations within each study frame
- Both participants are characterized as having PSS above their respective study means. The question is which is likely higher relative to their peers.  
- Magnitude and number of deviating indicators: Participant 2 has multiple very large standardized deviations (several Zs ≈ ±2 or greater) on measures that have strong sample-level associations with PSS (especially GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.71). Participant 1’s elevations are present but generally more modest in Z (mostly around +1) and include several protective, high-Z features (exercise Z ≈ +1.07, self-rated physical health Z ≈ +1.30, interpersonal trust Z ≈ +1.79) that likely mitigate perceived stress in that sample.  
- Sleep severity: Participant 2’s objective sleep is dramatically worse (median ~3.7 hours vs Participant 1’s ~6.0 hours) with much higher variability — this likely translates into a stronger contribution to perceived stress relative to their sample.  
- Correlation strength: Key measures that are extremely elevated for Participant 2 (GAD-7, PSQI, pain, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) have stronger sample correlations with PSS than many of Participant 1’s elevated measures; thus, Participant 2’s profile maps more directly to predictors of high PSS.

Overall judgment
- Although both profiles are interpreted as above their study means, the preponderance and magnitude of high-Z, high-PSS-correlating indicators (severe anxiety, extreme sleep restriction and fragmentation, high pain/interference, emotional lability, very low self-efficacy) are substantially greater for Participant 2 than the more moderate elevations (and stronger protective features) seen for Participant 1. Therefore Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated baseline physiology: Resting heart rate (65.1 bpm; Z = 0.83) and mesor (Z = 1.32) are above the sample mean; resting HR has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), consistent with greater tonic autonomic arousal.
- Sleep timing and compensatory napping: Late median sleep onset (01:39) and shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 32 min; Z = −0.81), plus elevated mean daily naps (0.3; Z = 2.66), can reflect sleep timing/quantity patterns that co‑occur with increased perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or only near‑mean) PSS
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4; Z = −1.26), which correlates with lower PSS.
- Strong circadian/rhythm protection: high interdaily stability (Z = 1.08), high 24h autocorrelation (Z = 1.48), low intradaily variability (Z = −1.31). These rhythm features correlate negatively with PSS and are robust protective signals.
- Healthy lifestyle/protective behaviors: no alcohol/drug use, good academic performance, some regular exercise, low engagement in potentially stress‑exacerbating recreational habits.
- Overall summary in report: described as near the sample mean with only a slight tendency toward higher PSS (population mean = 21.62).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Strong self‑report signals strongly tied to PSS: GAD‑7 = 7.5 (mild anxiety) and Emotional Lability = 6.33; correlations with PSS are large (GAD‑7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67), making these powerful predictors of elevated PSS.
- Poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 9 (well above threshold), with PSQI–PSS correlation r = 0.59; subjective sleep disturbance is a strong contributor.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG‑3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55, which correlate with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50) and plausibly raise perceived stress.
- Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations during some late‑night hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), suggesting autonomic/nighttime disruption linked to higher stress.
- Report summary explicitly concludes perceived stress likely above the population mean (population mean = 20.75).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or mitigated) PSS
- Robust circadian physiology: high amplitude (Z = 0.95) and 24‑h autocorrelation (Z = 0.91) are protective and negatively correlated with PSS.
- Clear daytime cardiovascular activation and consolidated activity (daytime HR peaks, low nighttime HR) which correlate with lower PSS.
- Long objective sleep opportunity (median 10 h 11 min; Z = 1.64) and low napping (Z = −1.02), which are neutral or possibly protective in this dataset.
- Self‑efficacy (NGSE) near the sample mean and negatively correlated with PSS (r = −0.66), offering some buffering.

Comparative reasoning (taking into account each description is relative to its own population mean)
- Participant 1 is characterized as near the study mean PSS (21.62), with modestly elevated mood/anxiety symptoms and small physiological signs of higher arousal, but with strong and fairly large protective circadian and lifestyle signals that the summary judges to keep perceived stress around the population mean.
- Participant 2 is characterized as above their study mean PSS (20.75). Crucially, the elevated predictors for Participant 2 are high‑weight self‑report measures that have very strong correlations with PSS in that sample (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.80 and Emotional Lability r = 0.67, PSQI r = 0.59). The summary explicitly concludes perceived stress is likely above the population mean and notes that wearable protective signals moderate but do not override those strong self‑report predictors.
- Relative strength of adverse signals: Participant 2’s adverse indicators (anxiety, emotional lability, subjective poor sleep, pain interference) have larger effect/association sizes with PSS in their study than Participant 1’s adverse indicators (moderate CES‑D/STAI elevations and small RHR correlation). Participant 1’s protective circadian metrics are strong and judged sufficient to keep overall stress near the mean; Participant 2’s protective circadian metrics are present but described as insufficient to fully offset strong self‑report predictors.
- Population means are similar (21.62 vs 20.75), but that small difference does not override the within‑sample inference: Participant 2 is inferred to be above their mean with multiple high‑weight predictors, whereas Participant 1 is inferred to be roughly at the mean with mixed signals.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 more likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their peers) than Participant 1.

- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study population means. However, the nature and strength of the predictors differ. Participant 1’s elevated signals (depression, trait anxiety, PSQI, late/short sleep, some circadian blunting) are moderate in magnitude and those variables have only modest correlations with PSS in that cohort. Several protective factors for Participant 1 (no substance use, good GPA, interdaily stability) are substantial and temper the inference, leading to characterization as “modestly above” the mean.  
- Participant 2 presents multiple, convergent, and relatively strong predictors of higher PSS: clinically meaningful anxiety with a very large correlation to PSS (r = 0.77), severe subjective sleep disturbance, notable pain/interference, and emotional lability (r = 0.66). Several of these predictors have larger sample correlations with PSS than Participant 1’s top predictors, and some objective markers (circadian amplitude, very short sleep) are more extreme. Although Participant 2 has meaningful protective factors (high self‑efficacy, low interpersonal problems, low RHR), the risk indicators are both strong and numerous and the summary also concludes PSS > mean.

Overall balance of evidence
- Considering magnitude of self‑report elevations, the strength of their correlations with PSS in the respective cohorts, and the extremity of objective sleep/circadian disruption, Participant 2 shows a stronger and more convergent set of predictors of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1. Participant 1 is above mean but characterized as likely modestly elevated; Participant 2’s profile contains several high‑impact predictors (notably GAD‑7, PSQI, emotional lability, and pain measures) that point to a higher PSS relative to their sample.

20,69057,21,26,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Strongly elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) with a very large sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77).  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5) with a moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- High pain and pain interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86) with moderate correlations to PSS (~0.45–0.49).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9) with a large correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.66).  
- Wearable signals consistent with stress risk: very short median recorded sleep (≈3 h 55 m), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −1.51), and low interdaily stability — all directionally linked to higher PSS in the cohort (though some correlations are modest).  
- Protective factors that attenuate risk but do not fully negate it: high general self-efficacy (NGSE high; r with PSS ≈ −0.68) and low interpersonal problems; lower resting HR/mesor (small-to-modest protective association).

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53) with a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Objective and subjective sleep disruption: median wearable sleep ≈5 h 35 m (Z ≈ −1.99) and PSQI = 7; both commonly linked with higher perceived stress.  
- Circadian irregularity (interdaily stability below mean, intradaily variability elevated) and late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:08) plus a pronounced evening HR peak (Z ≈ +1.79) suggesting elevated evening activation; these features are directionally associated with higher PSS but correlations in the sample are generally small.  
- Contextual stressor: declining academic performance (GPA drop), lower health satisfaction and reduced happiness/self-esteem.  
- Protective factors that meaningfully mitigate risk: very low resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ −1.7 to −2.2), frequent exercise, low substance use, and low depressive symptoms — all of which tend to lower perceived stress or its impact.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and number of high-correlation predictors: Participant 1 shows multiple strong self-report predictors that have large correlations with PSS in their cohort (anxiety r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; PSQI and pain measures r ≈ 0.45–0.49). These high-correlation signals are both numerous and markedly elevated.  
- Participant 2’s most salient psychological predictor (trait anxiety) has a substantially smaller correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Many of Participant 2’s physiologic/circadian indicators are plausibly related to higher stress but their correlations with PSS are small, and several strong behavioral protectors (exercise, very low resting HR, low depressive symptoms) are present.  
- Sleep: Participant 1’s subjective sleep disturbance is more extreme (PSQI 13.5) and their median recorded sleep is shorter (≈3 h 55 m) than Participant 2’s objective sleep (≈5 h 35 m). Given the moderate correlation of PSQI with PSS in Participant 1’s sample, this favors higher PSS for Participant 1.  
- Pain and emotional lability, both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS in Participant 1’s cohort, have no clear counterparts of similar strength in Participant 2’s profile.  
- Overall balance: Participant 1 has multiple, relatively large, converging predictors of higher perceived stress (several with large correlations to PSS), with only a few strong protective factors. Participant 2 has important risk signs but also several strong behavioral/physiological protections and generally weaker predictor correlations.

22,69831,10,16,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Markedly elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = +0.83) — PSQI correlates moderately-to-strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward predictor.
- Wearable-derived indication of severe nocturnal disruption: median recorded sleep duration extremely short (1 hr 44 min, Z ≈ -1.24) and high night-to-night variability in sleep start times — these objective signals align with the PSQI and with higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and activity interference: PEG-3 average 7.78 (Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS composite Z ≈ +0.80; both correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), supporting higher perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal: modest positive midnight–early-morning HR deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.42).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Subjective sleep complaints despite long objective sleep: PSQI = 6 (classified disturbed) — subjective poor sleep can elevate perceived stress, though magnitude here appears smaller than Participant 1’s PSQI elevation.
- Late habitual sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:34 AM): delayed timing can be associated with circadian misalignment and daytime difficulties that increase stress.
- Behavioral/functional stressors: recent academic decline (term GPA 1.90) and low health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2), which are plausible psychosocial stressors.
- Low physical activity and high passive media/social time (exercise z’s ≈ -1.6 to -1.9; socializing and music use with high positive z’s) — lifestyle patterning associated with higher stress or poorer coping in population studies.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength of stress signals: Participant 1’s key upward predictors (PSQI = 16 and pain measures with Z ≈ +0.7–0.8) are comparatively stronger and are reported to have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 2’s stress-related signals (PSQI = 6, late sleep timing, low exercise, GPA decline) are weaker individually and/or are more behavioral/indirect.
- Strength of protective signals: Both participants have notable protective physiological and mood features, but they differ in balance. Participant 1 has very low anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.2, strong inverse correlate with PSS) and other psychosocial strengths (self-efficacy, low emotional lability) that substantially offset risk. Participant 2 shows physiological resilience (low RHR, robust circadian amplitude, low IV) and low trait anxiety/depression (z ≈ -0.3), which also offset risk signals — overall Participant 2’s protective signals appear at least as robust as Participant 1’s.
- Net inference in each description: The text explicitly characterizes Participant 1 as “near the mean” but “modestly above the mean” driven mainly by pronounced sleep disturbance and pain. Participant 2 is characterized as “near the mean,” with a modest tilt toward resilience on physiology and mood despite behavioral stressors. Because both population means are nearly identical, these relative characterizations are directly comparable.

Overall judgment
- Given the relative magnitudes and correlations reported: Participant 1 has stronger, directly PSS-linked elevations (notably a very high PSQI and elevated pain/interference with moderate-to-strong PSS correlations) and is explicitly described as modestly above the study mean. Participant 2 shows some stress-related behavioral signals but weaker subjective symptom elevations and stronger physiological/mood protections, and is described as overall near the mean with a modest tilt toward resilience.
- Therefore Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS) relative to their study population.

- Strong anxiety symptom burden: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) and GAD-7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.80).  
- Marked sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.49), extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 min, Z = -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median ≈ 02:49 AM, start-time SD Z = 1.16).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian disruption: elevated resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Emotional lability and pain-related interference: elevated BASIS-24 emotional lability (r with PSS ≈ 0.66) and PEG-3/PAPAS indicators (pain-burden correlations with PSS ≈ 0.47).  
- Overall synthesis in the description explicitly concludes perceived stress above the population mean (population mean PSS = 21.17).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Behavioral/risk factors that can increase stress: very high sedentary/screen time (large Z-scores for video games, TV, internet), very low exercise frequency (large negative Zs), and low social-trust (Z = -2.39).  
- Later median sleep start (~01:04 AM) and modestly elevated cardiovascular tone (HR mesor Z = 1.35; amplitude Z = 1.72; resting HR Z = 0.51), which have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample.  
- These are noted as potential contributors in the description, but their sample-level correlations with PSS are modest.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each description is framed against its own sample mean: Participant 1 is described as above their population mean (21.17) with multiple strong, converging indicators tied to PSS (especially GAD-7 r = 0.80; sleep and nocturnal HR elevations with moderate PSS correlations). Participant 2 is described as below their population mean (21.64) with very strong protective signals (CES-D = 0, STAI-Trait = 20 with large negative Zs; excellent circadian regularity IS Z = 2.4; PSQI = 3) that are directly associated with lower PSS.  
- The evidence for elevated stress in Participant 1 is both broader (multiple domains: anxiety, sleep, physiology, pain, emotional lability) and includes measures with stronger sample-level correlations to PSS than the risk indicators for Participant 2, which are fewer and have weaker correlations with PSS.  
- The two population means are nearly identical (21.17 vs 21.64), so the within-sample directions (P1 above mean; P2 below mean) and the relative strength of stress-related signals make it very likely Participant 1’s absolute PSS is higher than Participant 2’s.

18,70492,18,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean = 21.17)
- Strong, high-correlation anxiety signal: GAD-7 = 14.5 (z = 0.9) and GAD-7 has a very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.80), making this a powerful indicator of higher perceived stress in that cohort.  
- Severe objective sleep disruption: extremely short median nightly sleep (~2 h 19 m; z = -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median ≈ 02:49 AM; start-time SD z = 1.16), and high PSQI (13) — all measures that in this sample are meaningfully associated with higher PSS.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian disruption: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm; z = 1.67), low circadian amplitude (z = -1.57), low interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability — plus marked nocturnal HR elevations (~+8–9 bpm at midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42). These objective signals converge on heightened night-time arousal, a robust stress-related pattern in this dataset.  
- Elevated emotional lability and pain-related interference (BASIS-24, PEG-3) that correlate positively with PSS, providing further self-report evidence of greater burden.  
- Protective factors (slightly higher self-efficacy) are present but relatively small and explicitly judged unlikely to offset the strong anxiety, sleep loss, nocturnal arousal, and pain indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.61)
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI = 49 (z = 0.76) and CES-D = 16 (z = 0.28); both correlate positively with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.31 and r ≈ 0.28), pointing toward modestly higher perceived stress.  
- Large sleep timing variability and late bedtimes: although median sleep duration ≈ 7:05 (near average), sleep duration SD z = 2.75 and very late median sleep start (≈ 03:03) indicate marked night-to-night irregularity and delayed timing; sleep variability in this dataset associates with higher PSS (correlations ~0.13–0.17).  
- Reduced circadian amplitude and some fragmentation (amplitude z ≈ -0.44; MESOR z ≈ -0.60; lower autocorrelation), and behavioral factors (low exercise, more sedentary hobbies, modest alcohol use) that weakly tilt toward higher stress.  
- However, multiple protective/mitigating features: adequate total sleep time, low resting HR (z ≈ -0.54), above-average reported happiness and social time (both negatively correlated with PSS), and no naps — all of which reduce the strength of inference toward markedly elevated PSS.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Strength and relevance of indicators: Participant 1’s strongest indicators (high GAD-7 with r = 0.80; extremely short objective sleep; pronounced nocturnal HR elevations and circadian flattening) are both large in magnitude and strongly linked to PSS in that cohort. Participant 2’s indicators are more moderate in magnitude and/or have weaker correlations with PSS in that cohort (STAI/CES-D correlations ≈ 0.28–0.31; sleep variability correlations ~0.13–0.17).  
- Severity of objective disturbance: Participant 1 shows extreme objective sleep restriction and clear nocturnal physiological arousal—signs that are more severe than Participant 2’s primarily timing/variability problems (where total sleep time is preserved).  
- Balance of risk vs protective factors: Participant 1 has fewer and weaker protective signals relative to the strength of risk markers; Participant 2 has several notable protective features (social time, happiness, low resting HR, adequate duration of sleep) that mitigate the elevation in inferred PSS.

Conclusion
Based on the relative magnitudes of symptom/physiological abnormalities and their sample-level associations with PSS, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

14,73158,24,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety and emotional lability: GAD‑7 = 10.5 (at clinical screening threshold) and BASIS‑24 emotional lability high; these scales have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD‑7 correlation cited ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.65), so they are high‑weight indicators of higher perceived stress.  
- Disturbed subjective sleep and pain interference: PSQI = 8.5 (clinically disturbed) and high PEG‑3/PAPAS pain scores; these measures show moderate correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.55; pain r ≈ 0.43–0.47), supporting elevated stress.  
- Nocturnal/evening physiological arousal: large positive overnight HR deviations (e.g., +13–14 bpm around midnight–2am; Zs ≈ 1.25–1.36) that correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), indicating physiological activation consistent with higher stress.  
- Sleep variability/fragmentation: high night‑to‑night sleep SD (199 min, Z ≈ 0.65) can exacerbate subjective stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Pronounced early‑morning HR peaks: very large Zs for 5–6am and 6–7am HR deviations (+3.10 and +4.41) and small‑to‑moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.21–0.23), suggesting episodic physiological arousal that is associated with higher PSS.  
- Shorter nocturnal sleep duration: median ~6 h 11 min (Z ≈ −1.25) which can be a stress vulnerability despite good subjective sleep quality.  
- Some sleep‑timing variability (SD ≈ 67 min) that could contribute modestly to stress.

Comparative weighting and interpretation (within each study’s frame)
- Strength of evidence: Participant 1’s self‑report anxiety (GAD‑7) and disturbed sleep have strong-to-moderate correlations with PSS in that cohort (especially GAD‑7, r ≈ 0.77), giving these findings high predictive weight for higher PSS. Participant 1 also has corroborating physiological signs (nocturnal HR elevations) with moderate correlation to PSS.  
- Participant 2’s highest‑severity signals are physiological morning HR spikes (very large Zs) but those metrics have only small‑to‑moderate correlations with PSS in that cohort (r ≈ 0.21–0.23). Participant 2 otherwise shows very low depression/anxiety scores, high self‑esteem and happiness, good subjective sleep quality (PSQI below clinical cutoff), frequent group exercise, and no substance use—all strong indicators of lower PSS relative to that population mean.  
- Relative predictive strength favors Participant 1 being above their sample mean: their strongest indicators (clinical anxiety cutoff, poor PSQI, pain) map to measures that are tightly associated with PSS in that study. Participant 2’s concerning signs are more circumscribed and weaker predictors of PSS in their sample, and they are offset by multiple robust protective factors.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of self‑report and physiological evidence (and taking into account each description is relative to its own study mean), Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Very severe subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15 (Z = +3.83). Extremely elevated subjective sleep problems that commonly co‑occur with and amplify perceived stress.  
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 47 (Z = +0.56), a modest but positive correlate of PSS (r ≈ 0.31).

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 20.92)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD‑7 = 10.5 (meets screening threshold); GAD‑7 strongly correlates with PSS in this sample (r = 0.77). This is a strong predictor of above‑mean PSS.  
- Emotional lability elevated (BASIS‑24 Z = +0.53) and pain/interference elevated (PEG‑3 mean high; PAPAS Z = +1.21); both correlate positively with PSS (moderate r values).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8.5 (above clinical cutoff), associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Nocturnal/evening physiological arousal: sizable HR elevations around midnight–2am (Z ≈ +1.25–1.36) that are positively correlated with PSS in this sample.  
- Sleep variability/fragmentation (sleep SD Z ≈ +0.65) may contribute to perceived stress.  
- Summary: several strong survey predictors (notably anxiety) and nocturnal HR elevations point toward above‑mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Strength and extremity of risk indicators: Participant 1 has extremely elevated subjective sleep problems (PSQI Z = +3.83) and markedly high depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = +2.05), which are large deviations relative to that study’s distribution. Participant 2’s strongest survey predictor is anxiety (GAD‑7 clinically elevated) and nocturnal HR deviations (Z ≈ +1.3), but most of Participant 2’s z‑scores are moderate rather than extreme.  
- Correlation magnitude with PSS: For Participant 2, GAD‑7 has a very high correlation with PSS in that sample (r = 0.77), so the elevated GAD‑7 is especially informative that their PSS is above that study’s mean. For Participant 1, depression and subjective sleep are positively associated with PSS but with more moderate reported sample correlations (STAI/CES‑D r ≈ 0.27–0.31; PSQI correlation not numerically given but described as common comorbidity). Even so, Participant 1’s z‑scores on those measures are larger in absolute terms.  
- Protective factors: Participant 1 shows several protective/ buffering behaviors (long, stable objective sleep duration Z ≈ +1.22; regular exercise Z ≈ +1.07; social time Z ≈ +0.95; low substance use), which temper but do not eliminate the strong symptom signals. Participant 2 has clear protective physiological/circadian markers (high interdaily stability/autocorrelation Zs up to +0.97, low resting HR Z ≈ −0.86, higher self‑efficacy Z ≈ +0.12, low substance problems Z ≈ −0.77) that more substantially offset risk signals.  
- Net balance: Participant 1’s risk indicators include multiple large deviations (notably PSQI and CES‑D) that, even accounting for some protective behaviors, create a stronger overall signal of elevated perceived stress relative to that study’s mean. Participant 2 has important, high‑relevance risk indicators (clinically elevated anxiety and nocturnal HR spikes) but also stronger and more numerous resilience markers that moderate the overall inferred PSS elevation.

Conclusion
- Overall, weighing extremity of symptom scores, physiological corroboration, and the balance of protective factors within each study frame, Participant 1’s profile is more consistent with a higher PSS (worse perceived stress) than Participant 2.

- Elevated sedentary/screen-time behaviors (very high Zs for video games, TV, internet) that can reduce stress-buffering activities and relate modestly to higher PSS.
- Low social-trust score (Z = -2.39) which may reflect reduced perceived social support or interpersonal strain, a potential contributor to perceived stress.
- Late median sleep start time (~01:04 AM) which can create social/scheduling strain despite adequate duration.
- Modestly elevated heart-rate mesor and amplitude (Z ≈ 1.35 and 1.72) and slightly higher resting HR (Z ≈ 0.51) suggesting some tonic cardiovascular activation that correlates weakly with PSS.
- Very low physical activity/exercise (strongly negative Zs), removing an important behavioral stress buffer.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5) — PSQI shows a moderate correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep duration (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) and large night-to-night variability in sleep timing, both of which are linked to higher perceived stress.
- Substantial nocturnal heart-rate deviations (≈ +12 to +15 bpm around midnight–2 AM) with z-scores > 1; the 1–2 AM deviation has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- These sleep-related physiological and subjective indicators are strong, direct risk signals for higher PSS in this sample.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Both descriptions infer PSS below their respective study means (P1 mean 21.64; P2 mean 21.21). The task is to judge who is likely higher relative to the other.
- Participant 1: dominant signals are strongly protective against perceived stress — near-zero depression (CES-D = 0, Z ≈ -1.38) and very low trait anxiety (STAI-Trait Z ≈ -2.11), high self-esteem/happiness, good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 3), and very strong circadian regularity (multiple Zs > 2). Risk signals for P1 exist but are generally smaller in magnitude and/or have weaker correlations with PSS in the sample (sedentary behavior, late sleep timing, modestly elevated HR).
- Participant 2: shows a mixed profile. Protective trait-level signals are meaningful (very low anxiety GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.29 and higher self-efficacy with a strong negative correlation to PSS), but the sleep-related risk signals are large and directly tied to PSS (very high PSQI, extreme short objective sleep, high nocturnal HR deviations with moderate correlations to PSS). These sleep disturbances are more directly and moderately strongly associated with PSS in the sample than many of P1’s risk indicators.
- Relative magnitude and predictive relevance: P1’s strongest signals (very low depression/anxiety and excellent circadian regularity) are robust and point to relatively low PSS (likely near lower quartile). P2’s sleep pathology (objective and subjective) are strong predictors of elevated perceived stress and likely pull P2’s overall inferred PSS higher than would be expected from daytime trait measures alone.
- Net judgement: although both participants are inferred to be below their study means, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 carries more and more directly PSS-related risk (severe sleep loss/irregularity and nocturnal arousal) than Participant 1, whose major indicators are strongly protective. Therefore Participant 2 likely has the higher PSS (i.e., is less low relative to their peers).

- Extreme objective sleep deprivation and irregularity: median sleep ~5 h 27 min (Z = -2.16) and very large night-to-night variability (sleep-start SD Z = +7.44; sleep-duration SD Z = +5.88). These are highly deviant and strongly linked to higher PSS in the sample.
- Circadian disruption: low interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation and reduced amplitude (Zs ~ -1.5 to -1.8), consistent with poorer stress regulation.
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 42) and some wearable-derived nocturnal HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (hourly correlations up to ~0.21).
- The summary explicitly integrates these severe sleep/rhythm deviations and infers PSS above the study mean (21.61).

Countervailing factors (reduce likelihood of high PSS): low depressive symptoms, relatively high self-esteem, minimal substance use, normal BMI, good GPA, and somewhat low resting HR — these moderate but do not offset the very large sleep/circadian deviations.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very short objective sleep (median ~4 h 21 min) and substantial variability in sleep timing; these are strong risk markers for elevated perceived stress.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5) with a relatively large correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Large overnight heart-rate elevations around midnight–2 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm) with the 1–2 AM deviation showing a moderately strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.46). These nocturnal arousal signals are important predictors of higher PSS.

Countervailing factors (reduce likelihood of high PSS): very low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 2, z = -1.29) and high self-efficacy (NGSE z = +0.30). Importantly, these trait measures have very strong correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.65), providing robust protective evidence. Daytime physiology (low resting HR, strong interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation) also points toward lower PSS. The study summary infers PSS below the population mean (21.21).

Comparative reasoning (within their respective population frames)
- Both participants show notable sleep deprivation and objective sleep disturbance; Participant 2’s sleep appears numerically worse (≈4 h 21 min vs ≈5 h 27 min) and has stronger nocturnal HR arousal signals that correlate moderately with PSS.
- However, the strength of trait-level protective signals differs markedly: Participant 2 has very low anxiety and high self-efficacy, both of which are strongly (and more steeply) related to PSS in that study (large correlations), and the study’s integration concludes P2 is likely below that study’s mean. Participant 1’s protective signals (low depression, higher self-esteem) are weaker predictors of PSS in that sample (smaller correlations), while their sleep/circadian disruptions are extremely deviant and were weighted by the study toward an above-mean inference.
- The relative magnitudes of the predictive associations matter: P2’s protective trait measures have larger correlations with PSS than many of their sleep-risk metrics do; P1’s sleep/circadian metrics are both extremely deviant within that sample and are judged by the investigators to be the dominant drivers of inferred higher PSS.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 1 was explicitly inferred to be above their sample mean (21.61) primarily because of extreme sleep restriction/irregularity and circadian disruption, and the protective signals were weaker predictors in that dataset.
- Participant 2, despite having very short sleep and nocturnal arousal, has very strong protective trait signals (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy) that in that sample are strongly predictive of lower PSS; the study’s integration concluded P2 is likely below their sample mean (21.21).
- Therefore, when judged relative to each participant’s study-specific baseline and taking into account the strength of predictive associations reported, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 2.

- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z = 1.51) and a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.75) — a primary driver of higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ 0.83), plus very short median sleep (~4 h 55 min) and late sleep onset (~01:42) — sleep measures correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- High pain and activity interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6, which relate positively to PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z = -1.73, with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ -0.61) — signals reduced coping resources.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive night-time HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83) that align with self-report and correlate with PSS (e.g., 1–2 AM r ≈ 0.34).
- Note on magnitude: several of these indicators have large Z-scores and are directly linked to PSS via moderately large correlations.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning:
- Each profile is given relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.61); Participant 2 is inferred to be above their population mean PSS (mean = 20.62).
- The stress-related deviations in Participant 2 are larger in magnitude and include multiple strong, directly relevant self-report measures (severe anxiety, extreme sleep disturbance, high pain interference, low self-efficacy) that correlate strongly with PSS. Physiological data (notably pronounced nocturnal HR deviations and short sleep) further reinforce the elevated-stress inference.
- Participant 1 shows many robust protective indicators (low depression and trait anxiety, high happiness/self-esteem, good sleep duration/regularity, frequent social exercise) that outweigh the moderate circadian irregularities; the stress-relevant signals for Participant 1 are smaller and described as secondary/vulnerability markers rather than primary stress indicators.

Overall balance of evidence:
- Participant 2 displays a stronger, multi-domain high-stress signal (large Z-scores on anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, and self-efficacy; pronounced nocturnal arousal) that places them above their sample mean.
- Participant 1 displays multiple strong protective signals and only modest physiological circadian deviations that do not outweigh the low self-report distress; they are inferred below their sample mean.

25,69831,21,16,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed) despite long objective sleep — may reflect poor sleep quality/perception linked to stress.
- Very late median sleep onset (~01:34 AM) and possible circadian misalignment that can raise perceived stress.
- Low physical activity (reports no exercise), which correlates with higher stress in the sample.
- High passive media and social time (large positive z-scores), which in this cohort associate with stress/vulnerable coping.
- Lower current happiness and low health satisfaction, and recent academic decline (GPA 1.90), each are psychosocial stressors that could elevate PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6). GAD‑7 has very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78), making this a highly influential indicator of higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Pain interference (PEG ≈ 6.78) and PAPAS (z = 0.24), both positively correlated with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).
- Objective circadian/sleep instability: low interdaily stability (IS = 0.19, z ≈ -0.68) and very high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 273 min, z ≈ 1.7), patterns commonly linked to higher stress.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z ≈ 0.54).

Comparative weighting and within-frame reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean, so we compare how strongly each participant’s within-sample predictors point above their respective means.
- Participant 1’s most salient signals for elevated stress are behavioral/subjective (late sleep, PSQI just above cutoff, low exercise, low happiness/health satisfaction, poor GPA). However, several relatively strong protective signals (low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self‑esteem, low resting HR, robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability, long objective sleep duration) argue against a substantially elevated PSS. The original integrative judgment for P1 was “near the mean,” with a modest tilt toward resilience.
- Participant 2 shows multiple indicators that are both strongly correlated with PSS and clearly elevated: notably GAD‑7 (highest sample correlation with PSS) and very high PSQI, plus pain interference and marked circadian/sleep irregularity (high sleep SD and low IS). Although Participant 2 has protective factors (higher self‑efficacy, no substance problems, normative RHR), the indicators that most strongly predict PSS in this dataset are elevated for P2. The original integrative judgment for P2 was “slightly above the mean.”
- Because P2’s elevated features include measures that have larger sample correlations with PSS (especially GAD‑7 and PSQI) and because objective circadian/sleep instability is pronounced (higher z-scores), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to have a higher perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs.

Final determination
{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",69831,NetHealth,16,25,Pain,21
25,87032,21,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6). GAD‑7 correlates strongly with PSS in the sample (r = 0.78), so even mild anxiety is a salient risk signal.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Pain-related interference (PEG‑3 avg = 6.78; PAPAS z ≈ +0.24), which correlate moderately with PSS.
- Circadian / sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = −0.68), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (z = −0.35), and very high night‑to‑night sleep duration variability (SD z = +1.7) — patterns often associated with higher stress.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z ≈ +0.54).
- Offset/moderation: substantial protective factors (self‑efficacy z ≈ +0.3; substance problems z ≈ −1.62; normative resting HR z ≈ +0.15). Overall summary in the source: slightly above the study mean (probabilistic, modest elevation).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ +1.53), a strong psychological risk for higher PSS.
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ +0.27) plus PSQI z ≈ +1.52 (substantial subjective sleep disturbance).
- Pronounced circadian disruption: interdaily stability z ≈ −1.15, 24‑h autocorrelation z ≈ −1.87, high intradaily variability z ≈ +1.44 — indicating fragmented, irregular daily structure linked to worse stress outcomes.
- Elevated physiological arousal: higher MESOR (z ≈ +1.56) and resting HR (69.4 bpm, z ≈ +1.34); these physiology measures correlate positively (small–moderate) with PSS in the sample.
- Late and variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:00, start-time SD z ≈ +1.36), which commonly co-occurs with and amplifies perceived stress.
- Some protective factors (low substance use, good GPA, preserved self‑esteem), but source summary: overall likely above the population mean, with several z‑scores around +1.4 to +1.6.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both profiles are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the magnitude and breadth of risk signals differ.
- Participant 1 presents several risk signals (mild anxiety, poor subjective sleep, pain interference, high sleep variability) but also strong protective factors (notably high self‑efficacy and no substance problems). Many of Participant 1’s objective circadian deviations are moderate (z scores mostly < |1|) except sleep variability (z ≈ +1.7). The overall assessment in the description was “slightly above” the population mean (modest elevation).
- Participant 2 shows multiple, relatively large deviations from the sample mean across psychological (CES‑D z ≈ +1.5), subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ +1.5), circadian regularity (multiple z’s ≤ −1.1 to −1.9), intradaily fragmentation (z ≈ +1.44), and physiology (MESOR z ≈ +1.56; resting HR z ≈ +1.34). These are numerous and of larger magnitude than Participant 1’s signals and include sustained physiological activation, which is positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Taking into account that each description is calibrated to its own population mean, Participant 2’s deviations from that mean are larger and more consistent across psychological, behavioral, and physiological domains than Participant 1’s. Participant 1’s profile is more mixed with prominent protective factors that likely attenuate perceived stress relative to their population mean.

Decision
- Participant_2 shows the stronger and more consistent pattern of indicators that map to higher PSS relative to their study population; therefore Participant_2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

15,79167,15,10,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean = 21.29)
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ +0.67). In this sample PSQI correlates fairly strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Elevated pain / functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93), another measure with a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.62), and NGSE correlates negatively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.69), so this is a likely contributor to higher PSS.
- Elevated heart‑rate mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ +0.7 and +0.61) and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (hourly Zs up to ≈ +1.38) — these physiological signals show moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83), which in this sample has a small association with higher PSS.
- The summary explicitly concludes the weighted pattern supports PSS above the population mean.

Participant 1 — mitigating factors that temper but do not negate higher PSS
- Lower-than-average anxiety (GAD‑7 Z ≈ −0.76) — anxiety is strongly correlated with PSS in the sample, so this pulls expected PSS downward.
- Long median nightly sleep (Z ≈ +0.92), low mean naps (Z ≈ −0.56), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ −1.28), and slightly lower emotional lability (Z ≈ −0.37) — these are protective or neutral features.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.65)
- Wearable circadian irregularity and fragmentation: low interdaily stability (IS Z ≈ −1.07), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87), elevated intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +0.74), and reduced HR rhythm amplitude (Z ≈ −1.03). These features in this sample modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Some hourly HR deviations (early morning HR elevations, pronounced morning peak Z = +3.07) that have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23). (Overall these physiological/circadian signals have smaller effect sizes than the strong self‑report indicators below.)

Participant 2 — reasons for lower PSS
- Very low trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ −1.71) and low depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ −1.07); both are robust, direct self‑report indicators that typically track PSS closely.
- High positive well‑being: happiness Z ≈ +1.64, health satisfaction Z ≈ +2.05, elevated self‑esteem Z ≈ +1.24 — these strongly favor below‑mean PSS.
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z ≈ −0.8) and long median sleep (Z ≈ +1.25).
- Healthy behavioral profile (frequent exercise Zs > +1.0, low substance use, low sedentary time) and lower resting HR (Z ≈ −0.65) consistent with lower perceived stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes the balance favors PSS below the population mean.

Comparative evaluation (within each study’s frame)
- Each description is anchored to its own study mean. Participant 1’s strongest signals for elevated PSS are measures that, in that sample, show relatively large associations with PSS (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.31–0.47). Multiple converging indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, pain, lower self‑efficacy, nocturnal physiological arousal) point toward above‑mean PSS.
- Participant 2’s strongest signals are robust self‑report indicators of low distress (very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high happiness/health satisfaction, good subjective sleep) that typically correspond strongly to lower PSS; the physiological/circadian signals suggesting higher stress are present but described as smaller in magnitude and with weaker correlations to PSS in that sample.
- In short: Participant 1 shows several moderate-to-strong, PSS‑related stress signals; Participant 2 shows several strong protective, low‑stress signals with only smaller physiological/circadian countersignals.

Conclusion
- The overall balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ 0.67). PSQI correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r = 0.53), so this is a robust stress-related signal.
- Elevated pain / functional impairment (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ 0.93). PAPAS also correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.53), adding independent stress-related burden.
- Lower general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62). NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.69), so below-average NGSE is likely to raise perceived stress.
- Elevated heart-rate mesor and resting HR (Mesor Z ≈ 0.7; RHR Z ≈ 0.61) and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–early-morning deviations with Zs up to ≈1.38). Nocturnal HR deviations correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47), supporting physiological stress signals.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83) and late acrophase (10:58 PM), which in this dataset are associated (albeit more modestly) with higher PSS.
- The combination of multiple moderately-to-strongly correlated stress indicators (sleep, pain, self-efficacy, nocturnal HR) points toward elevated perceived stress relative to the population mean.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 41; near-sample-mean). STAI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), so trait anxiety could elevate perceived stress under some conditions.
- Some circadian fragmentation signals: modestly elevated intradaily variability (IV z ≈ 0.39) and low 24-hour autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.78). These metrics have small positive/negative associations with PSS (r ≈ 0.16 and r ≈ -0.17, respectively), indicating some vulnerability to higher stress.
- Low self-reported leisure/social time and very low solitary exercise frequency—behavioral features that could reduce stress-coping opportunities and thus modestly increase perceived stress.
- Notes on magnitude: these “higher risk” signals are generally small-to-modest in magnitude and their correlations with PSS in this sample are weak-to-moderate compared with the stronger signals observed for Participant 1.

Comparative reasoning (within-population frames and signal strengths)
- Both descriptions are relative to their own study populations and the population PSS means are nearly identical (21.29 vs. 21.61), so absolute mean differences are negligible for comparison.
- Participant 1 shows multiple indicators that are not only above/below the mean in stress-related directions but also tied to relatively strong sample-level correlations with PSS (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53 each; NGSE r ≈ -0.69; nocturnal HR deviations r ≈ 0.31–0.47). Several of these have Z-scores near or above ~0.7–0.9, and some HR deviations reach Zs >1.
- Participant 2’s risk indicators (trait anxiety, modest IV, low 24-h autocorr, low leisure) are smaller in both effect size and in their correlations with PSS (r values ~0.16–0.31) and several strong signals for low stress are present (very low RHR, high HR amplitude, stable sleep, high happiness).
- In short, Participant 1’s pattern shows multiple moderately-to-strongly weighted contributors that align with higher PSS, whereas Participant 2’s few risk signals are weaker and are outweighed by solid protective physiological and subjective markers.

Decision
- Based on the balance of evidence (magnitude of Z-scores, number of stress-related indicators, and strengths of sample-level correlations with PSS), Participant 1 is much more likely to exhibit a higher PSS score than Participant 2.

- Strong, convergent self-report indicators that strongly predict PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16, r ≈ 0.78), high emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = +1.23), low self-efficacy (NGSE z = −1.55, r ≈ −0.66), elevated pain interference (PEG-3 z = +1.18). These measures have large correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Objective wearable corroboration of distress: extremely short median nightly sleep (~2 h 58 m), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z = +1.3), low amplitude and low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ −1.4), and nocturnal heart-rate elevations that positively correlate with PSS. The physiological pattern (nocturnal arousal + circadian disruption) aligns with elevated perceived stress.
- Multiple converging domains (affect, sleep, physiology) consistently point above the population mean PSS (mean = 20.92), with limited and ambiguous counterevidence.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS
- Elevated affective symptoms and subjective distress: high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 28, z = +1.53), above-average trait anxiety (STAI z = +0.56), poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI z = +1.05), and low self-reported happiness (z = −1.61). These correlate positively with PSS (though correlations are modest, e.g., CES-D r ≈ 0.29).
- Objective indicators of sleep/timing risk: very large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = +2.68) and late/variable sleep onset (median ~03:11, start-time variability z = +1.43), which modestly relate to higher PSS.
- However, substantial protective features mitigate the risk: high circadian amplitude (z = +2.06), above-average autocorrelation (z = +1.06) and interdaily stability (z ≈ +0.42) — all negatively correlated with PSS — plus low resting HR, near-average total sleep time, higher self-esteem and robust social time. The evidence is mixed rather than uniformly high-risk.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and consistency of indicators: Participant 1 shows more consistent and stronger indicators that are tightly linked to PSS in this sample (e.g., GAD-7 with large r, objective nocturnal HR elevations correlated with PSS, very short sleep). Participant 2’s risk signals (depression, sleep variability, late timing) are meaningful but have smaller correlations with PSS and are counterbalanced by strong physiological circadian regularity and other protective factors.
- Severity of objective dysfunction: Participant 1’s median nightly sleep (~3 hours) and marked nocturnal physiological arousal are more extreme and more directly tied to stress-related correlates than Participant 2’s primarily timing/variability problems accompanied by preserved overall sleep duration and strong circadian amplitude.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s indicators are more uniformly indicative of elevated perceived stress, whereas Participant 2 presents a mix of elevated risk and substantive resilience/protective physiology.

11,45076,24,29,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean of 21.6)
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27) and mild depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 15; Z = 0.18), both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, above clinical cutpoint) and late/variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~00:57; SD ≈ 63 min), which tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.74) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.32), plus some early‑morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS — signals consistent with greater nocturnal arousal/stress for some participants.
- Lower recent happiness and lower health satisfaction (small negative Zs) that align with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might NOT have a higher PSS (protective/mitigating)
- Strong protective resources: high self‑esteem (Z = 1.38), frequent exercise (Z > 1), moderate social support/trust, low substance use, good academic performance — all negatively correlated with PSS.
- Healthy physiological baseline and adequate objective sleep duration (median 7 h 38 m; Z = 0.56), low resting HR, low BMI — factors linked to lower perceived stress.
- Net inference in their report: near the population mean with only a modest tilt above it.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean of 20.92)
- Strong, convergent self-report elevations that are highly predictive of PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16; Z = 1.16; r with PSS ≈ 0.78), very high emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 1.23; r ≈ 0.65), high pain/interference scores (PEG-3 z = 1.18), very low self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55; r ≈ -0.66). These are large effects and tightly linked to PSS in this dataset.
- Extreme wearable-derived sleep/circadian disruption: very short median sleep (≈2 h 58 m; Z = -0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.3), low interdaily stability/autocorrelation and markedly reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.4). These physiological markers strongly corroborate subjective distress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive HR deviations during typical sleep hours (e.g., 1–2am z = 1.18) with moderate positive correlations with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.36–0.40), consistent with stress-linked nocturnal activation.
- Holistic inference in their report: multiple large, convergent signals point to PSS above the sample mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might NOT have a higher PSS (moderators)
- Resting HR and mesor slightly below sample mean (not elevated), and some daytime HR deviations are lower than mesor, which could reflect fitness, medication, or lifestyle rather than low stress; these do not strongly argue for low PSS given the strong nocturnal/self-report signals.
- Some circadian flattening can be lifestyle-related rather than purely stress-driven, but that does not outweigh the strong anxiety/sleep evidence.

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Both summaries are given relative to similar population PSS means (21.6 vs 20.92), so absolute mean levels are comparable.
- Participant 1 shows only small-to-moderate risk signals (small positive Zs for anxiety/depression, PSQI = 6) that are substantially counterbalanced by large protective factors (self‑esteem Z = 1.38, frequent exercise, healthy sleep duration). The study summary explicitly infers PSS near the mean with only a modest tendency above it.
- Participant 2 shows large, convergent risk signals across the most PSS‑predictive self-report measures (large Zs and high correlations) and strong wearable corroboration (extremely short, late sleep and nocturnal HR elevations, marked circadian disruption). The study summary explicitly infers PSS above the mean, and the effect sizes/consistency are much larger than for Participant 1.
- Therefore, on balance of magnitude, convergence, and predictive relevance of indicators, Participant 2 is much more likely to have the higher perceived stress.

4,45641,31,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Very high clinical anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ +1.51) and anxiety has one of the strongest correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.75). This is a large, direct predictor of elevated perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance and short sleep: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83) and median sleep ≈ 4 h 55 min — severe sleep problems strongly linked to higher PSS; nocturnal HR elevations (late-night HR deviation Zs up to ≈ 2.8) support physiological hyperarousal.
- Elevated pain and activity interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ +1.4–1.6, which are positively associated with PSS and would increase daily strain and perceived stress.
- Low general self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -1.73, a fairly large effect in the direction known to increase PSS (r ≈ -0.61).
- Convergent physiological signal: multiple nocturnal HR deviations correlate with PSS (e.g., 1–2 AM r ≈ 0.34), aligning physiology with self-reported symptoms.

Counterpoints noted in the description (but not strong enough to outweigh the above): relatively preserved circadian amplitude and interdaily stability (protective, modest effects), low intradaily fragmentation, and average resting HR/substance use scores.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety: CES-D Z ≈ +0.9 and STAI-T Z ≈ +0.46; both positively associated with PSS and supportive of above-mean stress.
- Behavioral risk factors: very low exercise, low socializing, and very high sedentary hobby time (sedentary hobby Z ≈ +2.01) — these reduce coping resources and relate to higher PSS.
- Lower self-esteem and low health satisfaction (RSES Z ≈ -0.87; health satisfaction Z ≈ -1.45), which commonly coincide with greater perceived stress.
- Some physiological signs of arousal: modestly elevated resting HR/mesor (RHR Z ≈ +0.6; mesor Z ≈ +0.83) and evening/late-night HR elevations, which can reflect greater tonic or evening arousal.

Counterpoints in the description (protective, likely to lower PSS): strong and consistent circadian organization (interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.41, 24-h autocorrelation Z ≈ +0.81, amplitude Z ≈ +0.81), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -0.53), and adequate, consistent sleep duration (median ≈ 7 h 54 min, Z ≈ +0.89). The report frames the likely PSS elevation as moderate rather than extreme.

Comparative reasoning (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Strength and specificity of top predictors: Participant 1 shows several large, directly stress-relevant signals with large effect sizes (severe clinical anxiety Z ≈ +1.5 with a very strong correlation to PSS, severe sleep restriction ~5 h, high pain/interference Zs ≈ +1.4–1.6, low self-efficacy Z ≈ -1.73). Participant 2’s symptom elevations are generally more moderate (CES-D Z ≈ +0.9, STAI Z ≈ +0.46) and many key physiological/behavioral features are mitigated by strong circadian regularity and adequate sleep duration.
- Convergence across modalities: Participant 1’s self-report (anxiety, sleep, pain, self-efficacy) and physiological signals (large nocturnal HR deviations, short sleep) converge toward a high-stress profile. Participant 2’s risk signals (affective symptoms, sedentary behavior) are partly offset by robust wearable-derived circadian and sleep quantity measures.
- Likely magnitude of perceived stress: Although both participants are inferred to be above their respective sample means, the intensity and clinical severity of Participant 1’s indicators (clinical-range anxiety, severe sleep restriction, high pain, low self-efficacy, prominent nocturnal physiological arousal) point to a higher absolute perceived-stress burden than Participant 2’s more moderate affective elevations that are substantially buffered by preserved circadian structure and adequate sleep duration.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of evidence (stronger, clinically severe symptomatology and convergent physiological signs in Participant 1 versus more moderate self-report elevations partly offset by robust circadian/sleep metrics in Participant 2), Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

- Elevated affective symptom measures: CES-D = 22 (z ≈ +0.9) and STAI–Trait = 46 (z ≈ +0.46), both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and low self-esteem (RSES z ≈ -0.87) — factors that covary with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral risk profile: very low exercise, minimal socializing, and very high sedentary hobby time (sedentary hobby z = +2.01), which reduce coping resources and associate with higher stress.
- Low health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.45), modestly elevated resting heart rate/mesor (RHR z ≈ +0.6, mesor z ≈ +0.83), and evening HR elevations — physiological signs compatible with tonic/evening arousal and higher stress.
- Holistic interpretation in the description: the authors weigh the affective and behavioral signals more heavily and infer PSS above that population mean.

Protective/tempering signals to note (but not negating the above): strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability z ≈ +1.41; 24-h autocorrelation z ≈ +0.81), adequate median sleep duration (~7 h 54 min, z ≈ +0.89), and low intradaily variability (z ≈ -0.53), which make the inferred elevation more likely moderate than extreme.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5) and very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) with large sleep timing variability — strong behavioral/physiological stressors.
- Pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z-scores > 1) and a noted positive correlation of the 1–2 AM deviation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46). These nocturnal arousal markers can push inferred PSS upward.
- The description explicitly identifies these sleep-related disturbances as the primary risk signals that would elevate inferred PSS.

Protective/tempering signals for Participant 2:
- Very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 2.0; z ≈ -1.29) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +0.30). In this sample GAD-7 and NGSE have strong correlations with PSS (r ≈ +0.77 and r ≈ -0.65 respectively), so these are powerful protective signals against elevated PSS.
- Low pain and substance-use problems, low daytime emotional lability, low resting heart rate/mesor, and very strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability z ≈ +1.98; 24-h autocorrelation z ≈ +1.77) that are generally associated with lower PSS.
- The study authors weigh the trait/daytime indicators more heavily and infer PSS below that population mean.

Comparative reasoning (within each study frame) and overall judgment:
- Participant 1’s risk profile is broad and affective/behavioral: multiple symptom scales elevated (depression, trait anxiety), poor subjective sleep, low self-esteem and health satisfaction, and pervasive behavioral risk (low exercise/socializing, high sedentary hobby). Several physiological signs (elevated RHR, evening HR) also align with greater perceived stress. Although circadian regularity and sufficient sleep duration temper the conclusion, the overall pattern is multidomain and the original summary infers PSS above that sample mean.
- Participant 2’s main risks are severe but domain-limited to sleep and nocturnal arousal (very short objective sleep, high PSQI, midnight–2am HR elevations). However, Participant 2 shows strong protective signals on trait and daytime measures that have stronger sample correlations with PSS (notably very low GAD-7 and higher self-efficacy) and strong circadian regularity; the original summary infers PSS below that sample mean.
- Given that Participant 1 shows elevated affective symptoms and multiple behavioral and physiological risk factors that are directly and strongly linked to perceived stress, while Participant 2’s elevations are concentrated in sleep-related metrics but counterbalanced by strong trait protections, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely has the higher overall perceived stress relative to their respective population.

19,92038,28,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean)
- Strong sleep disturbance signals vs population: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0, “disturbed sleep”) and wearable median nightly sleep 2 h 38 min (Z = -0.94) with extremely late median sleep onset (03:12) and very high night-to-night onset variability (SD Z = +1.3). Sleep measures in this sample have a moderate positive correlation with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.47), so these are meaningful contributors.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations at 1–2 AM and 3–4 AM (Z ≈ +1.17 to +1.59). Overnight heart-rate elevations are moderately correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.32–0.38), consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Clinically relevant anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety); anxiety showed the strongest sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.78), so even a modest elevation on this scale strongly increases likelihood of higher PSS.
- Pain-related interference: PAPAS = 65 (Z = +0.19) and pain correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48), adding further upward pressure on perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation: interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation below average and intradaily variability elevated; these patterns, when combined with poor sleep and nocturnal arousal, are associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Although protective traits exist (higher self-efficacy Z = +0.3, low emotional lability Z = -0.97), they do not fully negate multiple strong sleep/anxiety/physiology signals that — given their correlations with PSS — point toward greater perceived stress than the sample mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean)
- Mild subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (slightly above common clinical cutoff) and late/variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:27, sleep start SD z ≈ +0.69; sleep duration SD z ≈ +1.0). Sleep timing variability and fragmentation correlate positively with PSS (though weakly).
- Circadian fragmentation and intradaily variability: intradaily variability z ≈ +1.23 and low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.87). Some hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated afternoon/evening peaks (z > +2), which have small positive correlations with PSS (up to ≈ 0.19).
- Elevated daytime/evening HR deviations could indicate sustained activation or evening arousal that modestly associates with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s adverse indicators (very poor subjective sleep, objectively extreme short sleep and irregularity, nocturnal HR elevations, and clinically meaningful anxiety) align with the strongest predictors of PSS in that study (notably anxiety r ≈ 0.78 and PSQI r ≈ 0.47). Several of these signals have moderate-to-large sample correlations with PSS and multiple stress-linked metrics are simultaneously present and pronounced relative to that population mean.
- Participant 2’s strongest signals are protective and substantially shifted in directions associated with lower perceived stress relative to their population (CES-D z ≈ -1.18, STAI-Trait z ≈ -1.02, Rosenberg self-esteem z ≈ +1.66, current happiness z ≈ +1.64). These affective/self-esteem measures have moderate correlations with PSS in that sample and carry substantial weight in the inference. The adverse signals for Participant 2 (circadian fragmentation, some evening HR elevations, PSQI ~6) are weaker predictors in this dataset (smaller correlations) and many physiological/behavioral markers (adequate sleep duration, low resting HR, frequent exercise) point toward lower tonic stress.
- In short: Participant 1 shows multiple, moderately-to-strongly weighted markers that elevate PSS relative to their cohort; Participant 2 shows several moderately-to-strongly weighted markers that lower PSS relative to their cohort, with only weaker/ambiguous signals pointing upward.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress (above their study mean), whereas Participant 2 is more likely to be below their study mean. The magnitude and relevance of Participant 1’s sleep and anxiety signals (and their established correlations with PSS in that sample) outweigh Participant 1’s protective traits; conversely, Participant 2’s strong protective self-report and physiological markers outweigh the weaker wearable-derived risks.

9,92038,12,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Mild subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, just above cutoff) and late/variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:27, high night-to-night variability). These indices correlate positively with PSS in the sample (sleep timing variability and PSQI have modest correlations).
- Elevated intradaily variability/fragmentation (z ≈ +1.23) and reduced circadian regularity (some rhythm measures below average). Intradaily variability correlates modestly with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Hourly heart-rate deviations (afternoon/evening peaks) that show small positive correlations with PSS (up to ~0.19), suggesting some elevated physiological activation at certain times.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and very short objective median sleep duration (3 h 27 min). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r = 0.46), and objective sleep restriction plus high sleep-duration variability are risk factors.
- Very high intradaily variability (z = 2.29) indicating substantial rest–activity fragmentation; this metric correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.24).
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale z ≈ +0.94), which could contribute to perceived stress (even though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).

Comparative framing within each study population
- Each description is relative to its own sample mean. Both participants are inferred to be below their respective sample means overall, but the contributors differ in type and magnitude.
- For Participant 1 (pop mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the strongest signals are protective: very low depression (CES‑D) and trait anxiety (STAI) and high self-esteem/happiness — these measures have moderate correlations with PSS in that sample and strongly favor lower PSS. The circadian/sleep irregularities that point to higher PSS are present but comparatively smaller in their sample-level associations.
- For Participant 2 (pop mean PSS = 21.42, SD = 7.28), the profile is mixed: the strongest predictive measures (GAD‑7 low, NGSE high, low emotional lability) strongly favor lower PSS (notably, GAD‑7 correlates with PSS at r ≈ 0.76 and NGSE at r ≈ -0.65). Countervailing indicators (PSQI = 10, very short objective sleep, high intradaily variability) are pronounced and have moderate associations with PSS (e.g., PSQI r = 0.46), so they represent substantial risk for higher perceived stress.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple, convergent protective psychological signals (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness) plus physiological/behavioral protections (low resting HR, frequent exercise, adequate median sleep duration). The risk signals (sleep fragmentation, circadian irregularity, mild PSQI elevation) are present but smaller in magnitude and have weaker sample-level correlations with PSS than the protective measures.
- Participant 2: the profile includes severe and objectively measurable sleep pathology (very short nightly sleep, high PSQI, large intradaily variability) that directly and moderately correlates with PSS. However, Participant 2 also shows very strong protective indicators (low GAD‑7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) whose correlations with PSS in that sample are larger than many of the sleep–PSS correlations (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.76, NGSE r = -0.65), which pushes inference toward lower PSS overall in that study’s frame.

Final judgement
- Although Participant 2 has extremely poor sleep indices (which are important risk factors), Participant 1’s profile presents fewer and weaker large-magnitude risk signals and a broader set of convergent protective indicators. Participant 2’s severe sleep disturbance and very high intradaily variability are nonetheless substantial red flags that could elevate perceived stress above Participant 1’s level in practice.
- On balance, given the severity of Participant 2’s sleep/circadian pathology (strongly associated with higher PSS in that sample) combined with some psychosocial strain, and despite Participant 2’s strong protective psychological scores, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit higher overall perceived stress than Participant 1.

24,18111,33,28,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS:
- Strong, highly predictive subjective elevations: GAD-7 = 18 (Z = +1.51) with very high correlation to PSS (r = 0.74); PSQI = 18.5 (Z = +1.65) with moderate correlation (r = 0.43); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = +1.03 (r = 0.63). These convergent, strongly PSS-related self-reports point to substantial perceived stress above the cohort mean (20.54).
- Additional subjective risk factors: elevated pain/interference (PEG-3), and reduced self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; NGSE r = -0.66), which further predict higher PSS.
- Although objective physiology shows some protective features (low RHR, organized circadian metrics like higher interdaily stability and lower intradaily variability), those objective features have weaker or modest correlations with PSS in this sample and do not outweigh the strong subjective signal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS:
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES-D = 27 (Z = +1.42) and STAI–Trait = 48 (Z = +0.66), both above the cohort mean and positively correlated with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Sleep/circadian disturbance: PSQI = 8 (Z ≈ +0.59), late and variable sleep timing, high nap burden (nap mean Z = +2.27), and notably reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.48) and interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.40). Elevated evening HR deviations (8–9pm Z ≈ +1.85) indicate evening physiological arousal that relates to stress.
- Some protective/neutral signs (normal resting HR, adequate average sleep duration, good academic functioning) moderate the inference, and many wearable–PSS correlations are modest, increasing uncertainty.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study mean PSS. Crucially, Participant 1’s elevated measures include variables that are both large in magnitude (z ≈ +1.5–1.65) and have very strong sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74 and Emotional Lability r = 0.63). That pattern implies a larger expected increase in PSS relative to their cohort mean.
- Participant 2 shows multiple concerning features (depressive symptoms, circadian blunting, evening arousal, high nap burden), but the self-report predictors that map to PSS have smaller correlations in that sample (CES-D, STAI r’s ≈ 0.28–0.31). Several of Participant 2’s strongest objective deviations (low amplitude/stability, evening HR) are meaningful but their links to PSS are less robust than Participant 1’s top predictors.
- In short: P1’s profile contains stronger, more PSS-predictive subjective elevations that are likely to translate into a larger above-mean PSS deviation than the combination of moderate self-report elevations plus rhythm disturbances observed for P2.

6,18111,20,28,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS (as described relative to P1’s study mean = 21.6)
- Elevated internalizing symptom scores: CES-D = 27 (z ≈ +1.42, “Depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 48 (z ≈ +0.66, “anxious”), both of which are associated with higher perceived stress in the sample (though reported CES-D/STAI correlations with PSS are modest: CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Disturbed sleep: PSQI = 8 (z ≈ +0.59) with late sleep timing, high night-to-night variability (sleep SD ≈ 113 min), and high mean daily naps (z ≈ +2.27) — sleep disruption often co-occurs with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian/physiological rhythm disruptions: low circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.48), low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.40), and pronounced evening HR elevations (8–9pm deviation z ≈ +1.85), which the summary interprets as consistent with elevated stress.
- Reduced restorative behaviors and low self-rated happiness (happiness z ≈ -1.61), which align with greater psychological strain.

Counterpoints noted in the description: resting HR and fitness-like physiology are normal (RHR z ≈ 0.0), adequate average sleep duration (~7+ hours), intact academic functioning and modest substance use — and many wearable–PSS correlations are small, which limits strength of physiological inference.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (as described relative to P2’s study mean = 21.08)
- Self-report measures that are both elevated and strongly predictive of PSS in this sample: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety; although z small, GAD-7 has very large sample correlation with PSS, r ≈ 0.77), high emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ +0.93; r ≈ 0.67), poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r ≈ 0.49), and low general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.62; r ≈ -0.66). These measures are described as the strongest and most directly relevant predictors of higher PSS.
- Some physiological/behavioral indicators consistent with stress: high resting HR (77.6 bpm; z ≈ +1.31) and MESOR (z ≈ +1.19), large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.12), and late sleep timing — all of which commonly accompany higher perceived stress.
- Pain interference and functional burden (PEG-3 ≈ 5.0; r ≈ 0.44) also contribute to stress appraisal.

Counterpoints noted: some wearable/circadian metrics are protective or mixed (circadian amplitude z ≈ +0.43, low intradaily variability z ≈ -1.20, median sleep duration ~7 hr), and many wearable–PSS correlations are weak or inconsistent (some even negative), so physiological signals are treated as secondary to self-report.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both participants are judged in their summaries to have perceived stress above their respective study means. The question is which participant likely exhibits the higher absolute PSS relative to their own mean-informed inference.
- Participant 1’s strongest objective signal is a large depressive symptom elevation (CES-D z ≈ +1.42) and several circadian disturbances (amplitude and stability z ≈ -1.4 each plus evening HR z ≈ +1.85). However, the summary emphasizes that CES-D and STAI correlations with PSS are only modest (r ≈ 0.28–0.31) and many wearable–PSS associations are small, so the link from these elevated indicators to higher PSS is weaker at the sample level. Participant 1 also shows several functional/physiological protective signals (normal RHR, healthy BMI, good GPA, adequate average sleep) that mitigate the inference.
- Participant 2 shows more direct convergence on measures that, in this sample, have strong associations with PSS: anxiety (GAD-7, r ≈ 0.77), emotional lability (r ≈ 0.67), low self-efficacy (r ≈ -0.66), and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI, r ≈ 0.49). Even if the standardized magnitudes of some of these scores are moderate, their strong sample-level correlations mean they are especially informative and predictive of higher PSS for this individual. Physiological indicators (high resting HR, MESOR, sleep variability) further support elevated stress for P2, albeit with some mixed rhythm measures that are partially protective.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: meaningful elevations in depressive/anxiety symptoms and circadian disruption suggest above-mean stress, but key predictors of PSS in the study are only modestly elevated or weakly associated with PSS; several protective signals are present.
- Participant 2: multiple self-report predictors that have large sample-level correlations with PSS are elevated (anxiety, emotional lability, low self-efficacy, poor sleep); wearable physiology also shows elevated baseline activation. The predictors for P2 are both conceptually and statistically stronger indicators of higher perceived stress within that study sample.

Conclusion
Given that P2’s elevated measures map onto the variables most strongly associated with PSS in their study (large r values) and there is converging physiological support, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",18111,NetHealth,28,6,Pain,20
16,74899,23,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 12 (classified as disturbed sleep), which is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Emotional dysregulation: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = +0.53 and this measure correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.65), indicating mood instability likely elevates perceived stress.
- Nocturnal and baseline cardiovascular arousal: elevated nocturnal HR deviations (1–4 AM) and elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = +1.37; mesor z = +1.18)—physiological signals that often accompany increased perceived stress.
- Highly irregular and extreme sleep timing/variability (very long median sleep and large night-to-night SD) which, although weakly correlated with PSS in this dataset, behaviorally aligns with dysregulation that can increase stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower or not-elevated PSS (protective signals)
- Low pain burden and interference (PEG-3 z = −1.39; PAPAS z = −1.24), both of which are positively correlated with PSS, so these are stress-protective.
- Relatively intact interpersonal functioning (BASIS interpersonal z = −1.77) and low substance-related problems.
- Only mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 6; z ≈ −0.59) despite its strong correlation with PSS in the sample, limiting one major stress driver.
- Several circadian metrics have weak correlations with PSS in this sample, reducing confidence that physiological circadian differences reflect higher perceived stress.

Net for Participant 1 (within-sample frame): Mixed—several domain-specific signals point toward elevated perceived stress (sleep disturbance, emotional lability, nocturnal HR), but multiple protective factors and only moderate-to-weak associations for some physiological metrics lead to an overall inference near the population mean (i.e., not clearly above).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI trait z = +1.06, and trait anxiety is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). This is a substantive contributor.
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D z = +0.38 (classified “Depressed”) and positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).
- Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 9, z = +1.05, classified as disturbed sleep—another strong stress-associated signal.
- Objective short, late sleep: median sleep ≈ 5 h 58 min (z = −1.52) with very late sleep onset (~02:25 AM); combined with disturbed PSQI supports reduced restorative sleep and higher stress.
- Circadian fragmentation/instability: higher intradaily variability (z = +0.46) and lower 24-hr autocorrelation (z = −0.19), which in this sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Physiological activation patterns: elevated mesor and resting HR (z ≈ +0.95 and +0.47) and pronounced evening HR deviation (5–6 pm deviation z ≈ +1.69), indicating periods of sustained physiological activation compatible with greater perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower or not-elevated PSS (protective signals)
- Frequent exercise (z ≈ +1.07), good self-rated physical health (z ≈ +1.30), high interpersonal trust (z ≈ +1.79), and moderate social contact—behaviors/resources that can buffer stress.

Net for Participant 2 (within-sample frame): Multiple moderately strong and convergent indicators (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed PSQI, short/late objective sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening physiological activation) point to perceived stress above the study mean. Protective behaviors are present but described as insufficient to outweigh the elevated symptom/physiological profile.

Comparative reasoning (taking each description relative to its own population)
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as near their population mean (PSS mean = 20.96) with mixed signals: some domain-specific elevations but also notable protective features. The strongest within-sample predictors of PSS for Participant 1 are emotional lability and nocturnal HR, but other high-correlation predictors (e.g., anxiety) are not elevated.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as above their population mean (PSS mean = 21.59) with multiple convergent elevations in psychological symptoms (trait anxiety, depression), subjective sleep disturbance, objective short/late sleep, circadian fragmentation, and physiological activation—several of which have nontrivial correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Both participants show some elevated physiological markers (e.g., higher mesor/resting HR), but Participant 2 has stronger and more numerous psychosocial/subjective symptom elevations that are known and reported in the summaries to correlate with PSS.

Weighing the balance of evidence: Participant 2 shows a clearer, multi-domain pattern consistent with higher perceived stress relative to their study population, whereas Participant 1’s profile is mixed and interpreted as near their population mean. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Nocturnal autonomic signs linked to stress:
  - Late-night heart-rate deviations at hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), suggesting sleep-related arousal that relates to higher perceived stress.
- Integrative note: although wearable circadian metrics are relatively protective, the strongest predictors in this dataset (anxiety, emotional lability, subjective poor sleep) point toward perceived stress above the population mean (20.75).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Short objective sleep duration:
  - Median nightly sleep 5 h 33 min (Z = -2.02), a marked deviation that is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian/sleep timing irregularity:
  - Late median sleep start (~01:20 AM), nontrivial variability (~54 min SD), and reduced interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.9 and -0.78), which in this sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Early-morning HR deviation pattern:
  - Deeper nocturnal HR drops and sharper morning rises with modest positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Strength and direction of signals:
  - Participant 1’s elevation in likely-PSS is driven by multiple self-report variables that are both directly relevant to perceived stress and have large correlations with PSS in the study (notably GAD-7 r = 0.80, Emotional Lability r = 0.67, PSQI r = 0.59). Those offer a strong within-sample signal for being above their population mean.
  - Participant 2’s risk signals are primarily objective sleep/circadian markers (very short objective sleep, timing variability, reduced interdaily stability). While these are meaningful (and the sleep duration Z is large), their correlations with PSS in this dataset are described as modest relative to the self-report predictors. Critically, Participant 2 also shows multiple large-magnitude protective self-report indicators (very low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction) that the summary treats as outweighing the objective sleep risks, leading to an inference of PSS below that population mean (21.62).
- Relative magnitudes and predictive weight:
  - The dataset notes that some self-report predictors (anxiety, emotional lability, subjective sleep disturbance) are among the strongest correlates of PSS. Participant 1 exhibits multiple such strong-risk self-report signals.
  - Participant 2’s largest deviations include strong protective self-report Z-scores (e.g., health satisfaction Z ≈ +2.05, STAI-Trait Z ≈ -2.11) that are associated with lower PSS and are judged to dominate their risk signals in the original interpretation.

Overall judgment
- Balancing the number, effect sizes, and direct correlations with PSS, Participant 1 displays a more compelling profile for elevated perceived stress (above their study mean) driven by high-weight self-report predictors that strongly track PSS. Participant 2, despite a pronounced objective short-sleep signal, has multiple large protective self-report indicators and lower anxiety/depression scores that the original synthesis concludes place them below their population mean.
- Therefore, Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Short objective sleep duration (median 5 h 33 min; Z = -2.02), late sleep timing and timing variability (~01:20 AM start, SD ~54 min), and reduced interdaily circadian stability (IS = 0.30, Z = -0.9). These objectively link to higher PSS in the study (though correlations are described as modest).
- Wearable heart-rate patterns (deeper nocturnal drops and sharper morning rises) that showed small positive correlations with PSS (~0.19–0.21) at pre-dawn hours — a pattern sometimes seen with sleep debt or physiological arousal.
- The description notes that these objective sleep/circadian features are meaningful risk factors that could elevate stress over time or under increased demands.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe and objectively/subjectively confirmed sleep disruption: median sleep ~3 h 4 min and very large night-to-night sleep-start variability (SD = 401 min), plus very high PSQI (13.5, “Disturbed Sleep”). PSQI and objective short/irregular sleep are strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (PSQI r = 0.50).
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9.0 with very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated and strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75; pain measures that correlate positively with PSS), which plausibly raise perceived stress.
- Marked circadian instability and reduced rhythm amplitude (multiple rhythm metrics with negative Zs), which are associated with higher PSS.
- Multiple high-PSS–correlating measures point in the same direction (sleep, anxiety, emotional lability, substance issues), giving a coherent high-stress signal.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its study’s mean PSS. Participant 1 is explicitly judged below their population mean (21.62) primarily because very low depression/anxiety scores (CES-D = 1; STAI-Trait = 20), high self-esteem/happiness, healthy behaviors, and low resting HR are strong protective signals with substantial negative associations with PSS in that sample. The objective sleep/circadian signals that point toward higher stress are described as having only modest correlations with PSS in that study and are outweighed by multiple large-magnitude protective self-report indicators.
- Participant 2 is explicitly judged above their population mean (21.33) because several of their strongest measures (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, circadian instability) have large positive correlations with PSS in that study (notably GAD-7 r = 0.78, emotional lability r = 0.68). Their sleep disruption is both subjectively severe and objectively extreme — a stronger and more coherent set of high-PSS indicators than seen in Participant 1.
- Effect-size and coherence matter: Participant 1’s stress-related signals are mostly modest objective metrics versus large-magnitude protective self-reports. Participant 2 shows multiple large/strongly PSS-correlated risk indicators that are internally consistent (sleep + anxiety + substance issues + circadian instability), with fewer and weaker protective signals (primarily high self-efficacy and modestly low RHR).

Weighting the balance of evidence
- The magnitude and concordance of high-PSS correlates in Participant 2 (especially very short/irregular sleep and high anxiety with strong sample correlations to PSS) outweigh Participant 1’s objective sleep/circadian concerns.
- Participant 1’s profile is dominated by strong protective psychosocial and mental-health signals that were judged sufficient to place them below their study mean despite some objective sleep irregularities.

11,82986,24,19,"Brief answer
- Based on the described data, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence favoring elevated stress)
- Markedly short sleep duration (median 5 h 6 m; Z = -2.6) and very late sleep timing (median start 02:24) — sleep loss and late timing tend to raise perceived stress.
- Circadian disruption: reduced amplitude (Z = -1.04), lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability — these objective rhythm disruptions are associated with greater stress and poorer recovery.
- Elevated resting heart rate (66.8 bpm; Z = 1.03) and modest daytime HR elevations — signals of increased autonomic arousal that correlate positively (albeit modestly) with PSS in the sample.
- In sum: objective physiology and sleep behavior provide several plausible mechanisms that could increase PSS over time.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence favoring elevated stress)
- Strong, convergent self-report markers that are tightly correlated with PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16; z = 1.16; r ≈ 0.78 with PSS), very poor PSQI (15), elevated emotional lability and pain interference — these are direct predictors of higher PSS.
- Low perceived coping resources (NGSE z = -1.55) — a strong negative correlate of PSS, which increases vulnerability to stress.
- Severe sleep/circadian disruption corroborated by wearables: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m), very late sleep timing (~02:23), greatly reduced amplitude (z = -1.4), high intradaily variability and very low interdaily stability — objective pattern consistent with high stress.
- Marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations during typical sleep hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am deviation z = 1.18; that hourly HR correlates with PSS) — physiological arousal during sleep that parallels reported anxiety/stress.
- In sum: strong, mutually reinforcing subjective and objective indicators that have known large correlations with PSS in this dataset.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is inferred to be near-to-slightly-below their population mean PSS (population mean 21.62), because subjective self-report measures (low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness) strongly predict lower PSS despite physiological risk signals.
- Participant 2 is inferred to be above their population mean PSS (population mean 20.92), because multiple self-report scales with high predictive power for PSS are elevated and are supported by clear objective sleep/circadian and nocturnal-arousal signals.
- Although Participant 1 shows an extreme sleep-duration Z (−2.6), their protective subjective profile (very low depression/anxiety and high psychosocial resources) argues that current perceived stress was not elevated in this sample; the objective risks may reflect future vulnerability but not necessarily current high PSS.
- Participant 2 shows both strong subjective distress (especially severe anxiety and low self-efficacy) and objective physiological corroboration (very short/late sleep, circadian flattening, nocturnal HR elevations) — a convergent pattern that more directly indicates higher current perceived stress relative to their sample.

Overall weighing of evidence
- The weight of convergent evidence (strong self-report predictors + concordant wearable physiology and HR signatures that are correlated with PSS) is substantially greater for Participant 2 than for Participant 1.
- Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to have the higher PSS score.

3,82986,13,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Very short objective sleep (median 5 h 6 m; Z = -2.6) and late/irregular sleep timing (sleep start ~02:24; PSQI = 6). Short, late, and disturbed sleep are established contributors to higher perceived stress in this sample.
- Circadian fragmentation/reduced amplitude (low interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability, reduced cosinor amplitude). These objective rhythm disruptions are associated with greater physiological strain and can precede rises in perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate (66.8 bpm, Z = 1.03) and some daytime HR elevations consistent with increased autonomic arousal, which is modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample (resting HR r ≈ 0.14).
- Taken within this study’s frame, these objective physiological/sleep signals push toward higher PSS even though correlations with PSS are modest.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5). In this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), so severe self-reported sleep problems are a likely contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) are elevated and show moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47), making them plausible stress drivers.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54) could reduce social support and elevate perceived stress for this person.
- Elevated resting HR/mesor (Z ≈ 1.2 each) are additional physiological signs, though weakly correlated with PSS.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5) is present; GAD-7 has a strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.77), so any anxiety elevation is noteworthy even if mild.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- PSS is a subjective measure; therefore self-report indicators that strongly correlate with PSS in each study are especially informative. In Participant 1’s profile, the strongest subjective predictors of PSS (depression, trait anxiety) are low, favoring a PSS at or below that study’s mean despite strong objective physiological stress signals. The objective markers (very short sleep, circadian fragmentation, elevated HR) are concerning but are only modestly correlated with PSS in that sample.
- In Participant 2’s profile, several subjective indices that have moderate-to-strong links to PSS (very poor PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain, and some anxiety) are elevated. The participant also has strong protective factors (high NGSE, robust circadian regularity, low emotional lability) — NGSE is a strong inverse predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.63) and pushes toward lower perceived stress — but the presence of multiple subjective risk factors that are moderately correlated with PSS gives more direct evidence for elevated perceived stress than the primarily objective risks seen in Participant 1.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: objective physiological/sleep risk is high, but subjective self-reports tied strongly to PSS (depression/anxiety, self‑esteem/happiness) indicate low distress; the overall inference in the original summary is “near to slightly below” the study mean.
- Participant 2: has a mix of strong protective resources (notably NGSE and regularity) but also several subjective risk factors (PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain) that map more directly onto PSS and have moderate correlations with PSS. The original summary also places this participant near or slightly below the mean but notes the subjective sleep/pain factors as meaningful stress contributors.

Conclusion
- Because PSS is subjective and Participant 2 shows multiple elevated subjective risk factors that have moderate-to-strong relationships with PSS in their study (notably very poor PSQI and pain/interference), whereas Participant 1’s strongest signals are objective physiology while their subjective symptom scores are clearly protective, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS relative to their respective study population.

14,29257,24,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = -1.23) indicating inconsistent daily timing of physiological rhythms, a feature in this dataset that correlates with higher PSS.  
- Sleep timing and variability: late median sleep onset (~01:32) and elevated night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD = 151 min, z = +1.14), behaviors that can co-occur with or exacerbate perceived stress.  
- Dampened circadian physiology: reduced cosinor heart-rate amplitude (z = -0.75) and some nocturnal HR deviations that in the sample correlate positively with PSS.  
- Unusual behavior correlated with stress in this sample: high relative time listening to music (z = +2.06), which in this dataset showed a positive association with PSS (could be coping-related but aligns with higher stress here).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated anxiety/emotional dysregulation: GAD-7 = 10.5 (at clinical screening threshold) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z ≈ 0.53); GAD-7 in this dataset has a very strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77).  
- Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 8.5 (clinically “disturbed sleep”), a measure moderately correlated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Pain/interference: Elevated PEG-3 and PAPAS (PAPAS Z = 1.21), which correlate positively with PSS and add to overall distress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Marked overnight HR elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (+13.9 to +14.1 bpm; Z ≈ 1.25–1.36), and these hourly HR deviations are positively correlated with PSS in the sample.  
- Sleep variability/fragmentation: Substantial night-to-night variability in sleep (SD = 199 min, z = 0.65), which can worsen perceived stress even if median duration is long.

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is relative to its own study mean: Participant 1’s integrated profile is explicitly judged below their sample mean PSS (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), whereas Participant 2’s profile is judged above their sample mean PSS (mean = 20.92, SD = 7.51).  
- Strength of evidence for lower vs. higher stress: Participant 1 has very strong direct protective indicators (CES-D and STAI both >1 SD below sample means; PSQI z ≈ -1.26; RSES z = +1.10). These are measures with high construct overlap with perceived stress and collectively provide a robust signal toward lower PSS in that population. The countervailing indicators for Participant 1 (circadian irregularity, late sleep, variability, reduced amplitude, music listening) are meaningful but appear secondary in the integrated synthesis.  
- Participant 2 has multiple, strong indicators pointing toward higher perceived stress: clinically notable anxiety (GAD-7 at threshold with very high correlation to PSS), clinically disturbed sleep (PSQI > 5), elevated pain/interference, and corroborating nocturnal HR elevations that are themselves correlated with PSS. Protective features (good circadian stability, low resting HR, self-efficacy, low substance use) are present but the synthesis explicitly weights the survey-based anxiety/sleep/pain signals and nocturnal arousal as the primary drivers of above-mean PSS.  
- Magnitude/context: Although Participant 2’s study has a larger PSS SD (7.51) than Participant 1’s (3.68), Participant 2’s indicators include clinical-threshold scores and physiological arousal with moderate-to-large z-scores (e.g., nocturnal HR z ≈ +1.25–1.36, PAPAS z = +1.21), supporting a meaningful elevation above that study’s mean. Participant 1’s protective indicators include multiple >1 SD negative deviations on mental-health scales, arguing for a substantially below-mean PSS in their study.

Overall judgment
- The preponderance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (i.e., PSS above their study mean), while Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit lower perceived stress relative to their study mean. Therefore Participant 2 likely has the worse overall perceived stress.

- Very short objective nightly sleep (median 3 h 27 m; Z ≈ -0.66) — extreme sleep restriction is a strong stress-related risk factor in many studies and in this sample wearable sleep duration and PSQI trends relate to PSS.  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 197 min) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.46), so disturbed subjective sleep points toward higher perceived stress.  
- Very high intradaily variability in rest–activity rhythms (Z = 2.29) — this large positive deviation reflects fragmented circadian organization and, in the sample, trends with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.24).  
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 0.94) — some psychosocial stressor signal even if its correlation with PSS in the sample is small.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.23) and reduced HR circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.75) — these rhythm irregularities in the sample are associated with higher PSS.  
- Late average sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:32) and elevated night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD = 151 min; Z ≈ +1.14) — behavioral patterns that can co-occur with or contribute to greater perceived stress.  
- Unusually high time listening to music (Z ≈ +2.06) — in this dataset this behavior was positively correlated with PSS (could be a marker rather than cause).

Comparative, within-population perspective and weighing of evidence:
- Both profiles are described as overall below their respective population mean PSS, but the balance of risk vs. protective indicators differs.  
- Participant 1: the most salient high-stress signals are extreme objective sleep restriction and very high intradaily variability (one indicator >2 SD above the population mean). However, several of the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (GAD-7, NGSE, emotional lability) point toward lower stress for this participant: GAD-7 is low (Z ≈ -0.94), NGSE is relatively high (Z ≈ +0.49), and emotional lability is very low (Z ≈ -1.67). The protective indicators are strong because anxiety/self-efficacy measures have high correlations with PSS in this sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). Overall, the profile is mixed but the single very large circadian/sleep abnormalities create a meaningful upward pressure on perceived stress despite generally low self-reported anxiety and good self-efficacy.
- Participant 2: multiple robust indicators point toward lower stress (CES-D and STAI both >1 SD below mean, PSQI Z ≈ -1.26, high self-esteem Z ≈ +1.10, near-8-hour sleep duration Z ≈ +0.79). The circadian irregularities and some dampened HR amplitude are notable vulnerabilities but are generally secondary relative to very low depressive and anxiety symptom scores. Also, the population SD for PSS in Participant 2’s study is smaller (SD ≈ 3.68), so large deviations in CES-D/STAI (>1 SD) are particularly informative of lower stress relative to that sample.

Net judgment:
- Participant 2’s profile shows multiple strong, consistent indicators of lower perceived stress (very low depression/anxiety, good subjective sleep, high self-esteem, adequate objective sleep).  
- Participant 1’s profile is more mixed: although several high-weight self-report predictors point to lower stress, the severity of objective sleep restriction and extremely elevated intradaily variability are substantial risk signals that likely push their perceived stress higher than Participant 2’s.

- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12) with a very strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.77) — a high-impact predictor of perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, z = 1.32) that correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight heart-rate deviations above the sample mean (midnight–3am z ≈ 0.7–1.02) that show positive correlations with PSS (~0.22–0.39).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24) with a strong positive correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.68).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association to PSS (so lower self-efficacy predicts higher perceived stress).
- Although some signals are protective (adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR, low pain), the most salient indicators (anxiety, very poor PSQI, nocturnal HR, emotional lability) are high-impact and point to above-mean perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, z = 0.59) which positively correlates with PSS.
- Extremely large night-to-night sleep duration variability (sleep SD z = 3.37), a strong stress-risk signal linked to dysregulated routines and higher perceived stress.
- Blunted circadian amplitude (z = -0.81) and lower mesor (z = -1.28), which in this dataset modestly align with higher PSS.
- Some trait anxiety (STAI), which has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- However, multiple protective/offsetting signals are present (low resting HR/mesor, very low intradaily variability z = -1.73, frequent exercise, high social time, above-average self-esteem, no depressive/substance signals), and the summary judged P2 as only modestly above their population mean.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Both participants are described as above their respective study population means, but the strength and quality of evidence differ.
- Participant 1’s highest-impact predictors of PSS (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability) have large correlations with PSS (particularly GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77 and BASIS-24 r ≈ 0.68) and show clear elevations (clinically meaningful anxiety, very high PSQI, nocturnal HR arousal). These indicators are tightly linked to perceived stress and were judged to place P1 above their population mean with moderate confidence.
- Participant 2’s stress-relevant signals (sleep variability, modest PSQI, blunted amplitude) are meaningful but generally have smaller correlations with PSS in this dataset, and many strong protective signals counterbalance them; the net judgment for P2 was only “slightly above” their population mean.
- Given the relative magnitudes and correlation strengths, Participant 1’s profile contains more and stronger predictors of elevated perceived stress than Participant 2’s profile does within their respective sample contexts.

Weighing the evidence
- On balance, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 2.

- Very large night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep duration SD Z = 3.37), which is commonly linked to stress and irregular routines.
- Blunted heart‑rate circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.81) and lowered MESOR (Z = -1.28), both modestly associated with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Modest trait anxiety (STAI = 40) and below‑average current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), each positively correlated with PSS.
- Holistic summary in the study: characterized as “somewhat above” the population mean rather than markedly elevated.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5) with a large sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Extremely short objective sleep (median ~3 h 30 min) and very late sleep timing (median start ~03:37 AM) — severe sleep restriction that strongly favors higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z = +1.33; PAPAS Z = +0.43), with pain measures showing moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations during typical sleep hours (hourly Z up to ~0.67), with these nocturnal deviations correlated with higher PSS (up to r ≈ 0.43).
- Reduced circadian robustness (reduced amplitude and 24‑h autocorrelation), which in this sample links to higher PSS.
- Holistic summary in the study: judged “above the population mean,” with these sleep/pain/nocturnal‑arousal signals described as large and concordant.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are assessed relative to their own study means and are described as “above the mean.” The critical question is which profile contains stronger, higher‑impact signals that are more predictive of elevated PSS in their respective samples.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators are principally sleep disturbance and extreme night‑to‑night sleep variability, plus modest trait anxiety and blunted circadian amplitude. However, multiple moderately strong protective factors counterbalance risk (frequent exercise and socializing Zs are high, intradaily variability is very low Z = -1.73, low resting HR/MESOR), and several of the physiological correlations with PSS are small-to-moderate (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.16).
- Participant 2’s elevated indicators include objectively and subjectively severe sleep pathology (very short sleep, very late timing, high PSQI), elevated pain scores (with substantial PSS correlations), and nocturnal physiological arousal (with moderate correlations to PSS). Although Participant 2 has strong protective self‑report signals (very low GAD‑7 and high self‑efficacy, which have large sample correlations with PSS), the magnitude and consistency of the sleep/pain/nocturnal‑arousal abnormalities are described as large and concordant and were judged by the original summary to outweigh the protective factors.
- Put another way: Participant 1’s risk signals are mixed and partly offset by robust behavioral/physiological buffers, leading to a modest elevation above mean. Participant 2 shows multiple high‑impact, convergent risk factors (objective severe sleep loss, high pain, nocturnal arousal) that, despite meaningful psychological protections, are more likely to produce a larger net increase in perceived stress relative to their cohort.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The magnitude and coherence of Participant 2’s core risk signals (severe objective sleep restriction, high PSQI, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations) and their moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS make Participant 2 the more likely to have the higher PSS score overall.

  - Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7).
  - Delayed sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:14 AM) and a pronounced evening HR spike (8–9pm deviation Z = 2.32), which can reflect evening physiological arousal.

- Participant 2’s strongest signals are protective self-reports (very low CES-D and STAI–Trait, high self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise) which are also the strongest predictors of lower PSS in that dataset. The risk signals for Participant 2 (intradaily variability, PSQI, evening HR) are either weaker predictors of PSS or plausibly behavioral (late bedtime, evening activity) rather than clear indicators of higher perceived stress.

- Elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.77, Z = 1.58), which in this sample correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16) and indicates circadian fragmentation linked to stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, “Disturbed Sleep”), which is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:14 AM) and a pronounced evening HR elevation (+22.8, Z = 2.32), consistent with evening physiological arousal that can increase perceived stress or reduce recovery.
- Low reported socializing (15 minutes or less, Z = -2.20), a social-context vulnerability that can elevate perceived stress under strain.
- Possible behavioral contributors (late bedtime, evening activity, some alcohol use) that may drive physiological signs of arousal and raise stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Marked subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 10.5) — in this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), making this a substantial risk factor.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3 ~4.9; PAPAS ~50), which correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47) and can elevate perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54), which could reduce perceived support and contribute to stress.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5); GAD-7 is very strongly correlated with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77), so even mild anxiety is relevant.
- Elevated mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 1.16 and 1.22), which may reflect higher basal autonomic arousal associated with stress for some individuals.

Comparative within-sample weighting and inference
- Both descriptions are anchored to their own study means (P1 mean = 21.62; P2 mean = 21.38). The question is which participant is inferred to be higher relative to their own peers.
- Participant 1: strongest, most predictive self-report measures (CES-D, STAI–Trait) are very low, and self-esteem/happiness are high — these variables are among the strongest inverse predictors of PSS in that sample. Although there are physiological/sleep/circadian signals that point toward strain, the dominant, high-weight predictors (low depression/anxiety, high self-evaluations) argue for PSS below the population mean and likely meaningfully below it.
- Participant 2: presents a mix of substantive risk factors that have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample (high PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain, and some anxiety). The participant also has strong protective factors (high NGSE, strong circadian regularity), and the integrated inference in the description places this participant near the sample mean, perhaps slightly below it. Importantly, several of Participant 2’s risk factors (notably PSQI and pain) are more directly tied to higher PSS in that dataset than Participant 1’s objective circadian markers are tied to PSS.
- Net assessment: Participant 1’s profile is inferred to be below the mean mainly because of very low internalizing symptoms and high well-being; Participant 2 is inferred to be near the mean (and therefore higher than someone inferred to be below the mean) because notable, correlated risk factors (poor subjective sleep, pain/interference, interpersonal issues) counterbalance protective factors.

On balance, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their respective study population.

- Greater intradaily variability/fragmentation (Z ≈ 0.74), indicating more within‑day rhythm disruption linked to stress.
- Attenuated HR rhythm amplitude (Z ≈ −1.03) and some early‑morning relative HR elevations (morning peak Z = 3.07) that correlate modestly with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23).
- These wearable circadian/physiologic signals could reflect schedule-driven or stress-related arousal that would push perceived stress upward relative to the sample.

- Substantial nocturnal heart‑rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z‑scores > 1) with the 1–2 AM deviation showing a moderately strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- These nighttime sleep/physiology disturbances are strong, direct signals for higher perceived stress or sleep‑related distress, even if daytime trait measures are protective.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing of evidence
- Both profiles were interpreted by their study summaries as overall below their respective population means, but the strength and distribution of risk/protective signals differ.
- Participant 1: multiple robust protective self‑report indicators (very low trait anxiety STAI Z = −1.71; low depressive symptoms; high happiness, self‑esteem, health satisfaction), good subjective and objective sleep duration, regular exercise, and low RHR. The higher‑stress signals are primarily wearable circadian irregularity metrics that have only small-to-moderate correlations with PSS in the study. Overall, the protective signals are numerous and fairly strong relative to the modest physiological risk signals.
- Participant 2: strong daytime/trail protective signals (very low anxiety GAD‑7 Z ≈ −1.29, high self‑efficacy) that correlate strongly with lower PSS, but also very pronounced sleep disturbance (clinically high PSQI, extreme short sleep ~4.3 h, large sleep timing variability) and clear nocturnal HR arousal signals that have moderate correlations with PSS. The sleep-related risk in Participant 2 is more severe in magnitude than Participant 1’s wearable circadian irregularities and involves measures (subjective sleep disturbance, extreme short sleep) that are directly tied to perceived stress.
- Considering effect sizes noted in each summary: Participant 1’s strongest protective indicators are numerous and sizable (especially trait anxiety and overall well‑being), while their risk signals are smaller‑effect wearable circadian markers. Participant 2 has some very strong protective signals but also very large, direct sleep‑related risk signals (objectively extremely short sleep, clinically poor PSQI, nocturnal HR elevations) with moderate correlations to PSS. Those sleep risks are more likely to push overall perceived stress upward than the modest circadian fragmentation seen in Participant 1.

Conclusion
- On balance, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (i.e., a PSS closer to or higher above their study mean) than Participant 1, because Participant 2’s severe sleep disturbance and nocturnal physiological arousal are substantial, direct stress‑related risk signals that outweigh Participant 1’s chiefly modest wearable circadian risks.

Many of these measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in the sample (notably anxiety r ≈ 0.75).  
- Participant 2’s risk signals are milder and more mixed: trait anxiety is elevated but more modest (Z ≈ 0.86) and trait–PSS correlations are smaller (r ≈ 0.31); physiologic and behavioral risks are small-to-moderate and are substantially offset by multiple protective factors (good sleep duration/PSQI, strong circadian amplitude/stability, social exercise).  
- Both descriptions are relative to their own population means; even so, the magnitude and convergence of high-risk indicators in Participant 1 are larger and more consistent with a higher departure from the cohort mean than the milder, partially offset elevations seen in Participant 2.

Overall judgment
Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

17,22138,19,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean = 21.61):
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 50; Z ≈ +0.86) — the strongest single self‑report signal and moderately correlated with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.31).
- Modest depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 15), which is positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).
- Behavioral risk markers: variable/late sleep timing (median sleep start 01:15, SD = 121 min) and greater evening/online engagement and moderate alcohol use — sleep timing variability shows a small positive correlation with PSS.
- Wearable physiology: resting HR and mesor modestly above sample mean (Z ≈ +0.3–0.5) and small positive wearable‑PSS correlations suggesting mildly reduced overnight recovery in those with higher PSS.
- Overall summary in the report: judged “near to, but modestly above” the population mean, driven mainly by trait anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean = 21.12):
- Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z ≈ +1.25) — very strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (r = 0.81), a high‑weight predictor.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83), strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.51).
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.62), which inversely correlates with PSS in that sample (r = -0.66).
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS moderate; correlations with PSS ~0.44–0.48), adding psychosocial strain.
- Elevated physiological arousal: resting HR 79.8 bpm (Z ≈ +1.53) and mesor 88.5 (Z ≈ +1.49), consistent with sustained arousal linked to stress.
- Wearable sleep metrics indicating very short/late/irregular sleep (median 2 h 31 min, late median sleep start, high SD) — though wearable estimates may undercount, subjective sleep disturbance corroborates poor sleep.
- The summary conclusion in the report: multiple converging, high‑weight signals indicate perceived stress above the study mean.

Comparative weighting (within each study frame)
- Strength and number of high‑weight indicators: Participant 2 has multiple strong/high‑weight predictors of PSS (severe GAD‑7 with very high sample correlation; very poor PSQI with moderate–strong correlation; low NGSE with strong inverse correlation; high resting HR with large Z). Participant 1’s strongest predictors are weaker by comparison (trait anxiety moderate Z and smaller correlation with PSS; CES‑D modest).
- Magnitude of biometric deviation: Participant 2’s resting HR/mesor Zs (~+1.5) are substantially larger than Participant 1’s modest elevations (~+0.3–0.5).
- Convergence across modalities: Participant 2 shows convergence of severe subjective anxiety, severe subjective sleep disturbance, low self‑efficacy, pain, and physiological arousal. Participant 1 shows a mix of risk (anxiety, irregular sleep timing) and protective features (adequate sleep duration, good PSQI, strong circadian amplitude, nocturnal HR dips, social exercise), leading to only a modest elevation relative to that study mean.
- Population SD/context: Although Participant 2’s study has a larger SD for PSS (7.52) than Participant 1’s (3.68), the participant‑level Zs and very strong correlations with PSS in Participant 2’s dataset nonetheless indicate a clearer, stronger deviation toward higher perceived stress within that study’s frame.

Conclusion (which participant likely has the higher PSS):
Given the greater number, larger magnitude (Z‑scores), and higher predictive weight of convergent risk indicators for Participant 2 (severe anxiety, very poor sleep, low self‑efficacy, elevated resting HR and mesor, pain/interference), Participant 2 is most likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

11,79834,24,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report indicators tightly linked to PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16, z = 1.16), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15, z = 0.5), high pain interference (PEG-3 z = 1.18), and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 1.23). These scales have strong positive correlations with PSS in the cohort.
- Low perceived coping resources: low general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55), which correlates negatively with PSS and predicts higher perceived stress.
- Convergent wearable physiology showing sleep/circadian disruption consistent with stress: extremely short median sleep duration (~2 h 58 m, z = -0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low interdaily stability and amplitude (z ≈ -1.4), and very low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.4).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal that correlates with PSS: marked heart-rate elevations during typical sleep hours (e.g., 1–2am deviation z = 1.18) with positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40), providing physiological corroboration of nocturnal hyperarousal.
- Holistic assessment in the participant’s study explicitly concludes PSS above the sample mean (mean = 20.92).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (above clinical cutoff), indicating self-reported disturbed sleep which often associates with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral/social vulnerabilities: relatively late median sleep onset (~00:46), low physical/social recreation, low interpersonal trust (z ≈ -1.42), and elevated alcohol use (z = 1.68) — factors that can contribute to or reflect increased perceived stress.
- Mismatch between objective and subjective sleep: objectively long/regular sleep but subjective disturbance could reflect perceived poor sleep quality or awakenings that track with stress.

Comparative reasoning in the within-population frame
- Each summary is written relative to its study’s mean PSS (P1 mean = 20.92; P2 mean = 21.62). Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as having PSS above their study mean with multiple, strongly correlated self-report measures (large z-scores) and physiological markers (short/late sleep, circadian flattening, nocturnal HR elevations) that align with higher PSS. The associations reported for P1 with PSS are relatively strong and multimodal (subjective + objective).
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely below their study mean. The strongest and most consistent signals for P2 are objective physiological and symptom measures indicating lower stress (low resting HR, high 24-h autocorrelation and amplitude, low intradaily variability, low CES-D/STAI-T). The features suggesting higher PSS for P2 are weaker/more circumstantial (borderline PSQI, lifestyle factors, alcohol use, low trust) and the summary explicitly weighs physiology/symptoms more heavily and concludes below-mean PSS.
- In short, P1 shows multiple, convergent high-PSS signals (strong self-report correlations and physiologic corroboration), while P2 has stronger convergent evidence for lower perceived stress despite some behavioral risk signals.

Overall weighing of evidence
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (i.e., a higher PSS relative to their study mean) than Participant 2 does relative to theirs. Participant 1’s large-magnitude, convergent indicators of distress and nocturnal physiological arousal outweigh Participant 2’s mixed profile, in which physiological and symptom markers favor lower perceived stress and only a few behavioral/subjective measures weakly suggest elevated stress.

5,79834,14,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Very severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (classified “Disturbed Sleep,” strongly correlated with PSS) plus wearable median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 4 m and extremely large night-to-night sleep timing variability (SD sleep start = 401 min, Z = 2.82). These are large, high-weight signals linked to higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 (mild) and elevated BASIS-24 Emotional Lability (Z = 0.43); both measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in this cohort (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance-related difficulties and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse (Z = 1.75) and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS provide additional stress-related contributors.
- Circadian instability: reduced interdaily stability, low amplitude, and low 24-h autocorrelation (Zs negative) — these rhythm disruptions have modest positive associations with PSS in this sample.
- Convergent multimodal signal: several of the strongest PSS-correlated measures point in the same direction (sleep, anxiety, emotional lability), increasing confidence that perceived stress is above the population mean.

Protective/moderating factors (reduce but do not negate the above)
- Very high generalized self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79; strongly negatively correlated with PSS).
- Lower resting heart rate / lower mesor (Zs negative), suggesting lower tonic arousal or good fitness.
Overall balance in the within-sample frame: strong, convergent indicators of elevated stress outweigh the protective factors, leading the original summary to infer PSS above the study mean (21.33).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Subjective sleep complaint: PSQI = 6 (above typical cutoff), indicating disturbed sleep by self-report despite long objective sleep.
- Lifestyle and social-buffer deficits: late median sleep onset (~00:46), low exercise and leisure engagement, low interpersonal trust (z ≈ -1.42) — factors that can contribute to or maintain perceived stress.
- Elevated alcohol use (wine/liquor 3+ times/week; z = 1.68), which may reflect coping behavior and can co-occur with stress for some individuals.
- Mismatch between objective and subjective sleep (long objective sleep, yet PSQI >5), which can reflect sleep fragmentation or perceived nonrestorative sleep linked to stress.

Protective/moderating factors (strong)
- Low depressive/anxiety symptom scores (CES-D and STAI–Trait below sample mean) — these are robust negative correlates of PSS in the cohort.
- Robust circadian and cardiovascular markers consistent with low stress: high 24-h autocorrelation, higher amplitude, low intradaily variability, and low resting HR; these physiological features are associated with lower PSS in the sample.
- Long, regular objective sleep (median 8 h 18 m, Z = 1.39) — typically linked with lower perceived stress.
Overall balance in the within-sample frame: objective physiology and symptom scales strongly favor below-mean PSS; the indicators that could elevate PSS are more moderate/behavioral and less strongly correlated with PSS in this dataset. The original summary infers PSS below the study mean (21.62).

Comparative weighing (explicitly within each study’s frame)
- Strength and convergence of evidence: Participant 1 shows multiple, large, and convergent indicators that are strongly correlated with PSS in that cohort (extremely short objective sleep + very high PSQI, high GAD-7 correlation, substance problems, circadian instability). The magnitude of the sleep disturbance alone (median ≈3 h/night) is extreme and likely to push perceived stress well above the population mean.
- Participant 2’s strongest signals are protective and physiological (low symptom scores, robust circadian metrics, low resting HR, long objective sleep). The possible stress-elevating signs (PSQI = 6, late schedule, low trust, alcohol use) are more moderate in magnitude and less convergent; several key correlates with PSS (physiology, mood scales) point toward lower stress.
- Because each description is interpreted relative to its own sample mean, we compare direction and strength of within-sample signals rather than absolute PSS values. Within their respective contexts, Participant 1’s pattern is a stronger, more consistent elevation relative to peers than Participant 2’s pattern is.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of multimodal evidence and the relative strength and convergence of PSS-related indicators within each participant’s study frame, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

21,17020,30,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean = 21.61)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (>5) indicating poor sleep quality, a symptom that correlates with higher PSS in this sample.
- Late and irregular sleep timing: median sleep onset ~02:12 and high night-to-night variability (SD = 108 min) — circadian misalignment and irregularity are associated with higher PSS in the population.
- Elevated intradaily variability in activity/HR (Z = 0.67): linked positively with PSS in this sample and interpreted as greater fragmentation of arousal.
- Low social and recreational engagement and elevated internet use: behavioral patterns that tend to accompany greater perceived stress/reduced coping.
- Lower momentary happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and presence of trait anxiety (STAI ~40) that correlates with PSS — both point toward increased subjective stress burden.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not strongly elevated) PSS (protective signals to weigh)
- Low resting HR (48.2 bpm, Z = -1.18) and adequate median sleep duration (~7 h): physiological markers typically associated with better recovery and lower chronic arousal.
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, below-mean) and high global self-esteem (Rosenberg = 40): psychosocial buffers against perceived stress.
- Some preservation of interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of rhythms, and midday HR elevations that correlate negatively with PSS — these temper the stress interpretation.
- Overall conclusion in description: mildly above the population mean (i.e., only modest elevation).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean = 20.67)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 12, and this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a high-impact predictor of above-mean PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 17.5 (z = 1.32) which also correlates substantially with PSS.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (large hourly deviations around midnight–3am, z ~0.7–1.0) that positively correlate with PSS — objective evidence of nocturnal autonomic arousal.
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24) correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.68), supporting higher stress susceptibility.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ -0.66) — reduced coping reserves consistent with higher perceived stress.
- The holistic summary explicitly judges the participant as above the sample mean, driven by high-impact psychological and nocturnal physiological signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or mitigating) signals
- Objective sleep duration is adequate (median ~7 h 19 min, z = 0.66) and sleep variability is not elevated — but these have weak correlations with PSS in this dataset, so they are weak mitigators.
- Lower resting HR (57.9 bpm, z = -0.64) and modestly preserved circadian metrics (amplitude and autocorrelation) — these are protective but have weaker associations with PSS than the prominent psychological signals.
- Lower pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS z ≈ -1.1) — reduce stress contribution from somatic burden but again are less central than anxiety/sleep findings.

Comparative weighing of evidence (within each population frame)
- Strength and number of high-impact predictors: Participant 2 has multiple strong, highly PSS-correlated signals (GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77; PSQI z = 1.32; BASIS-24 emotional lability r ≈ 0.68; nocturnal HR elevations with positive correlations). These are both large in magnitude and high in predictive correlation with PSS in that study. The study summary explicitly rates these as the primary drivers of above-mean PSS.
- Participant 1’s above-mean indicators are present but weaker/more mixed: subjective sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity and behavioral/social withdrawal point toward higher PSS, but physiological markers (low resting HR, adequate sleep duration) and low depressive symptoms/high self-esteem are substantial protective signals. The study conclusion is only mildly above the mean.
- Relative certainty: Participant 2’s profile shows stronger, convergent psychological and nocturnal physiological evidence tied to PSS, whereas Participant 1’s profile is more ambivalent with important protective factors.

Final judgment
- Participant 2 more likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their respective population mean) than Participant 1.

- Strong anxiety signal: GAD-7 = 14.5 (moderate–high) and GAD-7 has a very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).  
- Severe objective sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 (disturbed); wearable median sleep ≈ 2 h 19 min (Z = -1.04) and very late/variable sleep onset (median ~02:49, start-time SD high). Sleep duration/variability metrics are known correlates of higher PSS in this sample.  
- Nighttime physiological arousal: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability—plus marked nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Emotional lability and pain burden: elevated BASIS-24 Emotional Lability and PEG-3 / pain-related interference correlate positively with PSS and are elevated here.  
- Multiple converging signals: self-report (anxiety, sleep complaints), objective sleep deprivation, and nocturnal physiological arousal all point in the same direction toward elevated perceived stress.  
- Limited protective offset: only modestly elevated self-efficacy (small buffering effect) and some weak physiological–PSS correlations for daytime HR.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), very late median sleep onset (~02:12) and elevated night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 108 min), features that associate with higher PSS.  
- Behavioral risk factors: low social/recreational engagement, minimal exercise, elevated internet use—patterns that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.67) and some daytime fragmentation which correlates positively with PSS in the sample.  
- Lower momentary happiness and trait anxiety present (STAI = 40) which relates to PSS in this cohort.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective)
- Good objective sleep duration: median ~7 h 7 min (healthy), which typically protects against higher perceived stress.  
- Low resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, Z = -1.18) and low MESOR (Z = -1.95), suggesting lower physiological arousal / possible fitness-related protection.  
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10) and high self-esteem (Rosenberg = 40) — psychosocial buffers that reduce PSS.  
- Some preserved interdaily stability and daytime activation patterns that are not consistent with chronic hyperarousal.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participant summaries conclude each individual is likely above their respective study mean PSS. However, the magnitude and consistency of stress-linked signals differ. Participant 1 shows multiple, strong, and convergent markers that are tightly linked to PSS in that sample (very elevated anxiety with r = 0.80 to PSS; extreme objective sleep restriction; nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS). These markers are severe (objectively very short sleep, high resting HR, flattened circadian amplitude) and together form a coherent high-stress profile.  
- Participant 2 shows a mixed profile: some subjective/behavioral risk factors (late, irregular sleep; PSQI > 5; low social/exercise) but also several fairly strong protective physiological and psychosocial indicators (healthy sleep duration, low resting HR, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem). The risk signals for P2 appear milder and less uniformly convergent than those for P1.

Overall weighing of evidence
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits worse (higher) perceived stress than Participant 2: P1’s severe sleep loss, strong anxiety score (with very strong sample correlation to PSS), nocturnal physiological arousal, and pain/emotional-lability signals outweigh their single modest protective factor. P2’s risk signals are present but tempered by multiple protective physiological and psychosocial factors and by less extreme objective markers.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), which in the sample has a positive (though modest) association with PSS.  
- Very late sleep timing: median sleep start ~01:27 AM—timing mismatch can contribute to stress or reflect lifestyle/contextual strain.  
- Low social/leisure engagement: very low socializing (Z = -2.20) and limited leisure time, which can reduce buffering/social support and is plausibly linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Lower momentary happiness: “Happy” score below sample mean (Z ≈ -0.53), a modest correlate of higher PSS.  
- Behavioral signals that could reflect demand/coping: moderate alcohol use (beer 1–2×/wk) and frequent group exercise (could reflect social demand or performance pressures).  
Overall note: these factors are present but described as modest-to-moderate contributors; physiological and trait indicators largely point toward resilience, and the integrated impression for this participant was near the population mean with a slight tilt below it.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Clinically relevant anxiety: GAD-7 = 10.5 (at/above screening threshold), with a very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a primary indicator of higher perceived stress.  
- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z ≈ 0.53) and strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8.5 (disturbed sleep) with moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Pain and interference: PEG-3 mean 8.33 and PAPAS Z = 1.21; these pain/interference measures correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47) and add to overall burden.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: substantial overnight HR elevations (~+14 bpm at 12–2am, Z ≈ 1.25–1.36) that correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), indicating physiological activation that aligns with higher subjective stress.  
- Sleep variability/fragmentation: large night-to-night sleep variability (SD 199 min, Z = 0.65), which can exacerbate stress even if median duration is long.  
Overall note: several of these indicators have relatively strong correlations with PSS in the sample and together form a coherent signal of perceived stress above the study mean, despite some protective features (self-efficacy, circadian regularity, low resting HR).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is reported relative to its own study population mean PSS (P1: population mean 21.62; P2: population mean 20.92). The descriptions explicitly place Participant 1 near the population mean with a modest tilt toward below-mean perceived stress, while Participant 2 is described as meaningfully above their population mean.  
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s elevated anxiety (GAD-7) and emotional-lability scores are strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (r’s ≈ 0.65–0.77), and nocturnal HR elevations and pain measures further corroborate an above-mean PSS. By contrast, Participant 1’s stress-relevant signals (PSQI, late timing, low socializing) are weaker/more domain-specific and are counterbalanced by multiple physiological and trait-level resilience markers (robust circadian metrics, adequate objective sleep duration, low depressive/anxiety trait scores).  
- Net evidence: Participant 2 has multiple high-importance, converging indicators that are tightly associated with higher PSS in their cohort; Participant 1’s indicators that could increase PSS are fewer and less strongly associated, and are outweighed by protective physiology and low trait symptom burden.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their cohort, and therefore to have the worse overall perceived stress when comparing the two participants within the context provided.

- Severe and objectively-confirmed sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 4 m (extremely short), and very large night-to-night sleep timing variability (sleep start SD Z = +2.82). In the study these sleep measures are strongly positively correlated with PSS and are among the most weighty indicators of elevated stress.
- Elevated anxiety and emotional lability: GAD-7 = 9.0 (mild anxiety) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z = +0.43); both measures have large positive correlations with PSS in the sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78, emotional lability r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: Substance Abuse subscale Z = +1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS—factors that plausibly increase perceived stress.
- Circadian instability and reduced 24-h rhythm amplitude/regularity (interdaily stability Z = -1.42; amplitude Z = -1.10), which in this dataset are associated with higher PSS.
- Balance note: protective factors (very high general self-efficacy Z = +1.79, lower resting HR/mesor) attenuate but do not fully offset the strong, highly PSS-correlated signals above.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), and late sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:27 AM). PSQI is positively associated with PSS in the sample, so this could raise perceived stress relative to peers.
- Low social/leisure engagement: socializing Z = -2.20 and broadly low leisure time—reduced social support/renewal opportunities can contribute to higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and some behavioral markers (moderate alcohol use, frequent group exercise) that could reflect situational demands or coping needs; these have small/ambiguous correlations with PSS in the cohort.
- Balance note: Most objective physiological and trait measures (robust circadian stability/amplitude, adequate objective sleep ~7.5 h, low depressive/anxiety trait scores, good nocturnal autonomic down-regulation) point toward lower or near-mean PSS; the higher-PSS signals for Participant 2 are fewer and less strongly correlated with PSS than the signals in Participant 1.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is referenced to its own population mean PSS: Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their population mean (mean = 21.33) driven by multiple strong, highly PSS-correlated indicators (especially extremely short/irregular objective sleep and elevated anxiety/substance problems). Participant 2 is described as near their population mean (mean = 21.62) with a slight tilt toward below-mean, because the dominant signals (robust circadian physiology, adequate objective sleep, low trait symptom burden) are protective; the countervailing indicators (PSQI = 7, late sleep time, low socializing) are weaker or less consistently correlated with PSS in the sample.
- The magnitude and coherence of stress-related signals differ: Participant 1 presents multiple convergent, strongly PSS-associated abnormalities (objective sleep extremely short, subjective sleep disturbance, high anxiety correlation, substance problems), whereas Participant 2’s risk indicators are fewer, more domain-specific, and opposed by strong physiologic/trait resilience markers.
- Given that PSS inference in both cases relies on measures with known correlations to PSS in their respective samples, the stronger and more numerous PSS-linked abnormalities in Participant 1 imply a higher inferred PSS relative to their study mean than the comparatively modest and mixed signals for Participant 2 relative to theirs.

- Strong, highly PSS-linked anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (severe; Z ≈ 1.51) and anxiety–PSS correlation in the sample is large (r ≈ 0.75). This is the single strongest predictor in the profile.
- Marked subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ 0.83) plus objectively late sleep onset (~01:42) and short median sleep duration (~4 h 55 m). Sleep loss amplifies perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large positive nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83) consistent with hyperarousal and correlated with PSS in night windows (e.g., 1–2 AM r ≈ 0.34).
- High pain and activity interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS elevated (Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) and positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42), increasing daily strain.
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -1.73; NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.61), so low self-efficacy is a substantial risk factor for higher perceived stress.
- Integrated pattern: multiple large-effect symptom measures that are directly and strongly associated with PSS (anxiety, sleep, pain, self-efficacy), plus physiological night-arousal, produce a coherent high-stress signal.

Countervailing (mitigating) features for Participant 1
- Relatively preserved circadian amplitude and interdaily stability (Z ≈ 0.58–0.91) and low intradaily fragmentation (Z ≈ -0.52), which modestly protect against stress.
- Resting HR near average and low substance signals, suggesting no broad chronic autonomic overactivation or substance-related coping.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 33 (Z ≈ 2.05) and STAI–Trait = 58 (Z ≈ 1.65). These are clinically meaningful signals that correlate positively with PSS (though correlations are more moderate: CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Low self-esteem and low happiness (Rosenberg Z ≈ -1.71; happiness Z ≈ -1.61), which are associated with higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (Z ≈ 1.05), indicating poor perceived sleep quality which commonly accompanies higher PSS.
- Within-day physiological markers of irregularity and arousal: high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.02) and notable evening HR elevations (6–8 pm deviations up to Z ≈ 2.24) that are associated with stress and irregular demands.

Countervailing (mitigating) features for Participant 2
- Objective nocturnal physiology preserved: adequate median sleep duration (7 h 37 m; Z ≈ 0.54) and robust nocturnal HR decline—these suggest physiological restoration overnight.
- Interdaily stability above average (Z ≈ 0.67), indicating regular day-to-day timing that buffers stress.
- Modest substance use and some exercise; resting HR typical—no signs of major physiological dysregulation.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both descriptions conclude the participant is likely above their study’s mean PSS. However, the nature, magnitude, and PSS-relevance of predictors differ:
  - Participant 1’s profile contains several high-impact, tightly PSS-linked features: severe clinical anxiety with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.75), objectively short sleep and nocturnal HR hyperarousal, high pain interference, and low self-efficacy (strong negative correlate). These multiple large-effect signals converge on mechanisms known to strongly elevate perceived stress.
  - Participant 2 has marked depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ 2.05) and elevated trait anxiety, plus within-day fragmentation and evening arousal, which do indicate elevated stress. But the key self-report predictors in this profile have more moderate correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and objective restorative physiology (adequate sleep duration and nocturnal HR decline) is relatively preserved—factors that mitigate the overall stress signal.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 shows a stronger, more convergent set of high-impact predictors (severe anxiety with a large PSS correlation, objective short sleep and nocturnal arousal, high pain, low self-efficacy). These are likely to produce a higher individual PSS relative to their cohort than Participant 2’s constellation, which—while clinically meaningful—relies on predictors with more moderate PSS associations and includes stronger objective restorative signs.

1,28327,17,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 1’s population mean)
- Strong sleep-related risk signals: clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5) and extremely short objective sleep (median ~3 h 30 m; very late sleep onset ~03:37 AM). Sample-level correlations reported tie poor/short sleep moderately to PSS (subjective r ≈ 0.48).  
- Elevated pain and interference: PEG-3 Z = +1.33 and PAPAS Z = +0.43; pain scales correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.5), supporting greater perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian attenuation: nighttime heart-rate elevations (late-night Z up to ~0.67), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.34) and reduced 24-h autocorrelation—these are modestly associated with higher PSS (e.g., nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.43).  
- Convergence of behavioral, subjective, and physiological sleep/pain signals creates several concordant stress-related abnormalities that in the summary drove an “above mean” inference.

Reasons Participant 1 might NOT have a higher PSS score (protective signals to consider)
- Low general anxiety (GAD-7 = 4.5; Z ≈ -0.85). GAD-7 showed one of the largest sample correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so this low score is a strong indicator of lower perceived stress.  
- High self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97), both inversely related to PSS in the sample and thus substantial buffers.  
- Resting/mesor HR near average; some circadian metrics close to mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s population mean)
- Large, clinically meaningful elevations in mood/anxiety symptomatology: CES-D = 33 (Z ≈ +2.05) and STAI–Trait = 58 (Z ≈ +1.65). These are substantial deviations from the sample mean and point to marked psychological distress; both correlate positively with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).  
- Low self-esteem and low positive affect: Rosenberg self-esteem Z ≈ -1.71 and happiness Z ≈ -1.61 — these negatively associated features are additional sizable signals of reduced resilience and greater perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05) and within-day physiological fragmentation: intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.02 and pronounced evening HR elevations (Z up to ~2.24) indicating late-day arousal—these align with higher perceived stress.  
- Multiple large self-report abnormalities converge (depression, trait anxiety, low self-regard, low happiness), which the summary treated as primary drivers of above-mean PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might NOT have a higher PSS score (protective signals)
- Objective nocturnal physiology relatively preserved: median sleep duration above sample mean (~7 h 37 m; Z ≈ +0.54) and robust nocturnal HR decline—these mitigate autonomic/stress interpretations.  
- Interdaily stability above mean (Z ≈ +0.67) implying some day-to-day regularity, and typical resting HR; modest substance use and some exercise—these are buffering behaviors.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are judged by their summaries to be “above” their study-specific population means, but the nature and strength of the signals differ.  
- Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are objective/behavioral physiology (extreme short sleep, late timing, nocturnal HR elevations) and pain—features that have moderate correlations with PSS in the sample. However Participant 1 also has a notably low GAD-7 score, and GAD-7 has a very high sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77). That protective signal is both large in predictive weight (strong correlation) and meaningfully below the cohort mean, which reduces confidence that Participant 1’s PSS is extremely high despite the severe sleep/pain anomalies.  
- Participant 2’s strongest signals are large, concordant self-report psychopathology elevations (CES-D Z ≈ +2.05, STAI Z ≈ +1.65) and low self-regard/happiness. Although correlations of CES-D/STAI with PSS are described as more modest than GAD-7’s correlation in the other study, the magnitudes of these Z-scores are substantial and multiple related psychological measures are elevated together, producing a coherent pattern of psychological distress. Evening physiological activation/intradaily fragmentation provide additional corroboration. The mitigators for Participant 2 (adequate objective sleep duration, nocturnal HR decline, interdaily stability) are meaningful but appear less central than the marked self-report symptom burden.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: strong behavioral/physiological stressors (very short sleep, pain, nocturnal HR), but counterbalanced by a very low anxiety score and high self-efficacy—one extremely predictive protective variable (GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77) reduces the likelihood that perceived stress is extremely high relative to that study’s mean. The summary itself was “above mean” but with moderate confidence.  
- Participant 2: multiple large self-report psychopathology elevations (depression, trait anxiety, low self-esteem/happiness) that coherently indicate psychological strain; objective data partly mitigate but do not overturn the strong self-report signal. The pattern is consistent and of high magnitude across several interrelated measures.

Final determination
- Overall, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their study population, because Participant 2 shows multiple large, concordant psychological symptom elevations and corroborating physiological fragmentation/ evening arousal, whereas Participant 1’s extreme sleep/pain signals are substantially offset by a very low anxiety score and strong self-efficacy, which—given their high sample-level predictive value—reduce the net likelihood that Participant 1’s perceived stress exceeds Participant 2’s.

24,48013,33,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z = +1.51) — this scale has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74), making it a powerful predictor of elevated perceived stress.  
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = +1.65), with PSQI positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = +1.03; r with PSS = 0.63), increased pain/interference (PEG-3 elevated), and lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.44; NGSE r with PSS = −0.66) — several subjective measures that each relate substantially to PSS and converge on higher stress.  
- Convergence and effect‑size weighting: several of the strongest correlates of PSS in this dataset are markedly elevated for this participant, which the summary explicitly treats as the dominant evidence for above‑mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = +1.35) and elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = +0.59), both positively associated with PSS (correlations ~0.28–0.31).  
- Marked circadian/rhythm disruption: very low interdaily stability (Z = −1.48), low 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = −1.54), and reduced cosinor amplitude (Z = −1.08). These objective rhythm deviations are large and in this sample track with higher PSS.  
- Large night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep duration SD Z = +1.13; sleep start SD Z = +0.80) and somewhat late sleep timing — features that modestly associate with higher PSS.  
- Low current happiness and low self‑esteem (Z’s ≈ −1.4 to −1.6), which further align with higher perceived stress in aggregate.

Comparative interpretation within each study frame
- Strength and specificity of predictors: Participant 1’s elevated measures include multiple scales that (in this dataset) have strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.74 and BASIS‑24 r = 0.63). Those strong, convergent subjective signals are large Z deviations (GAD‑7 Z ≈ +1.5; PSQI Z ≈ +1.65). By contrast, Participant 2’s largest self‑report Z (STAI Z ≈ +1.35) is important but the STAI→PSS correlation is more modest (~0.28–0.31).  
- Objective data weighting: Participant 2 shows pronounced objective circadian disruption (Zs ≈ −1.5), a clear risk factor for higher PSS in their dataset. Participant 1 shows objective physiology that trends in the opposite (protective) direction (e.g., low RHR, higher interdaily stability, consolidated rhythms). Thus objective wearables pull Participant 1 toward lower PSS and Participant 2 toward higher PSS.  
- Net balance: For Participant 1, very strong subjective indicators of stress (high‑effect predictors) outweigh objectively protective physiology in the provided assessment. For Participant 2, objective rhythm disruption plus moderately elevated anxiety/depression produce above‑mean inferred PSS, but the self‑report predictors are generally lower effect sizes than the strongest predictors for Participant 1, and there are more behavioral protective factors (regular exercise, limited substance use).

Weighing overall evidence
- Participant 1: multiple high‑impact subjective elevations (GAD‑7, PSQI, emotional lability, pain, low self‑efficacy) — large correlations with PSS — strongly indicate above‑mean perceived stress despite objectively protective physiology.  
- Participant 2: clear and large objective circadian dysregulation plus moderate self‑report distress indicate above‑mean perceived stress, but the self‑report predictors are less strongly correlated with PSS in the sample and there are notable protective behaviors (exercise, near‑normal median sleep) moderating risk.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",24,Pain,33,48013,NetHealth,25
8,48013,20,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35) and elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = +0.59) — these psychosocial measures are positively associated with PSS and are substantive deviations from the sample mean.
- Marked circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z = −1.48; 24‑hr autocorrelation Z = −1.54; amplitude Z = −1.08) and increased night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep duration SD Z = +1.13) — objective rhythm disruptions that in the study are associated with higher PSS.
- Low subjective well‑being indicators (happiness Z = −1.61; self‑esteem Z = −1.43) that, in aggregate, align with greater perceived stress.
- These multiple convergent psychosocial and wearable signals lead the summary to infer PSS above the study mean (population mean = 21.61).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 8) and very strong correlation of GAD‑7 with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.77) — a single measure here carries strong predictive weight for PSS.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13, r ≈ 0.49 with PSS) and objective sleep showing extremely short median nightly sleep (median 1 h 39 m, Z = −1.27) and very late sleep onset — patterns consistent with high perceived stress (noting study caveat about possible device non‑wear/artifact).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = +0.63) and pain/interference (PEG-3) — both measures that correlate moderately/strongly with PSS (emotional lability r ≈ 0.66).
- Physiological signs of hyperarousal: elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.19–1.24), reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −1.05), intradaily variability high (Z ≈ +1.07), and nocturnal/early‑morning HR deviations that correlate with PSS — multiple independent wearable indicators pointing to stress-related arousal.
- The summary explicitly concludes PSS is likely above the sample mean (population mean = 21.08).

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Strength of predictors: Many of Participant 2’s strongest signals (GAD‑7, emotional lability, PSQI, self‑efficacy) have very high correlations with PSS in the dataset (e.g., r up to ~0.77, 0.66, 0.49, -0.65). By contrast, Participant 1’s primary self‑report predictors (STAI, CES‑D) show more modest correlations with PSS in this sample (~0.28–0.31). This means that, relative to their respective populations, Participant 2’s elevated measures are more tightly linked to PSS than Participant 1’s are in the corresponding dataset.
- Magnitude and convergence: Both participants present multiple convergent lines of evidence for elevated stress (self‑report and wearables). Participant 1 shows pronounced circadian irregularity and psychosocial low well‑being but also notable protective behaviors (regular exercise, near‑normal median sleep). Participant 2 shows physiological hyperarousal (elevated resting HR/MESOR, nocturnal HR elevation), very short and late objective sleep, and high‑correlation self‑report measures — a combination that appears more strongly tied to higher PSS in this dataset.
- Uncertainty/artifacts: Participant 2’s extremely short objective sleep raises a caveat (possible device non‑wear), which reduces confidence somewhat, but the subjective PSQI is also very elevated and strongly correlated with PSS, supporting the inference of high perceived stress despite the artifact concern. Participant 1 has mitigators (exercise, limited substance use) that materially temper the inferred PSS relative to their population.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Because Participant 2’s elevated measures include several variables that are highly predictive of PSS in that study (notably GAD‑7 and emotional lability), and because multiple wearable indices indicate physiological hyperarousal that aligns with higher PSS, the overall evidence for a higher-than-average PSS is stronger for Participant 2 than for Participant 1 when judged relative to their own samples.
- Participant 1 shows clear signals of above‑mean stress, but the relevant predictors in that sample are less strongly correlated with PSS and there are more prominent mitigating behaviors.

21,67177,30,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 12 (z = 0.46) and this measure has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), making it a high-impact predictor of elevated perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 17.5 (z = 1.32) with a moderate sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45), a large-magnitude signal toward higher stress.
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight hourly HR deviations above the sample mean (e.g., midnight–1am z ≈ 1.02) that positively correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39), suggesting impaired overnight recovery.
- Lower self-efficacy: NGSE z ≈ −0.25 with a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.66), consistent with greater perceived stress due to lower coping resources.
- Substance-related difficulties: BASIS-24 substance subscale z ≈ 1.5 (stress-relevant even if its direct correlation with PSS here is negligible).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI z = 0.46 (r with PSS ≈ 0.31) and CES-D z = 0.28 (r with PSS ≈ 0.28) — both point toward higher perceived stress but have more modest correlations than Participant 1’s anxiety measure.
- Some sleep and recovery concerns: PSQI slightly elevated (z = 0.13), median sleep duration a bit low (z = −0.35), and large sleep start variability — these can increase perceived stress.
- Low positive affect / self-worth and lifestyle risks: low happiness (z = −1.61) and self-esteem (z = −1.01), low exercise and socializing, BMI ≈ 30 — these behavioral/affective factors tend to co-occur with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting HR (z ≈ 0.84) which modestly correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.13).

Factors in Participant 2 that work against a high PSS estimate (important for comparison)
- Strong, regular circadian physiology: very high interdaily stability (z = 1.24) and 24-h autocorrelation (z = 1.40), moderate amplitude (z = 0.82), and low intradaily variability (z = −0.74). These features correlate negatively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.12 to −0.18) and represent notable protective/resilience signals.
- No substance use and no napping (protective behaviors).

Comparative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective sample means, but the nature and magnitude of stress-linked signals differ.
- Participant 1 shows several high-impact indicators that are strongly tied to PSS in that sample: particularly the GAD-7 (very strong correlation with PSS) and a large PSQI elevation (z = 1.32). Objective nocturnal HR elevations further converge on a picture of physiological arousal at night. These are relatively large-magnitude signals pointing toward above-mean PSS.
- Participant 2 shows multiple above-mean affective and behavioral risk factors (anxiety, depressive symptoms, low happiness/self-esteem, low activity/socializing) but these individual signals have more modest correlations with PSS and smaller z-scores overall than Participant 1’s strongest signals. Crucially, Participant 2 also has strong physiological resilience markers (high interdaily stability and autocorrelation, moderate amplitude, no substance use) that are associated with lower PSS and substantially mitigate the symptom-based risk.
- Weighting impact by both magnitude and sample-level correlation with PSS, Participant 1’s combination of a highly PSS-correlated anxiety score and very poor subjective sleep (with supporting nocturnal HR arousal) provides stronger evidence of a higher perceived stress burden relative to their population than Participant 2’s more mixed profile, where protective circadian regularity markedly offsets modest symptom elevations.

- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 7 (disturbed; Z = 0.13) and median sleep ≈ 6 h 54 min (Z = −0.35) with high night-to-night sleep-start variability (SD = 87 min). PSQI correlates positively with PSS in the sample.  
- Low positive affect and self-worth: happiness score Z = −1.61; RSES Z = −1.01 — both directions that track with higher PSS.  
- Elevated resting HR (65.2 bpm, Z = 0.84), small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.13).  
- Lifestyle/behavioral risk factors: minimal exercise, low socialization, limited recreation, BMI ≈ 30, low health satisfaction — all plausibly contributing to stress burden.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean)
- High anxiety and emotion-lability: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) with a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.80); BASIS-24 emotional lability Z = 0.33 (r = 0.66).  
- Severe sleep disruption (self-report and objective): PSQI = 13 (disturbed; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.49); median nightly sleep only ~2 h 19 min (Z = −1.04); very late/variable sleep onset (start-time SD = 269 min, Z = 1.16).  
- Marked physiological arousal and circadian disruption: high resting HR 81.23 bpm (Z = 1.67); low circadian amplitude (Z = −1.57); low interdaily stability (Z = −1.34); high intradaily variability (Z = 1.23). Nocturnal HR elevations (~+8–9 bpm near midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 elevated (Z = 0.44) and pain-related burden correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).  
- Minor protective factor: modestly higher self-efficacy (Z = 0.12) that correlates negatively with PSS (r = −0.65) but small in magnitude relative to multiple strong risk signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population PSS means. Participant 1’s deviations above mean are generally modest (many Zs close to 0.3–0.8) and some strong protective circadian features (interdaily stability Z = 1.24, 24-h autocorrelation Z = 1.40; intradaily variability Z = −0.74) are explicitly linked to lower PSS in that sample. The write-up characterizes Participant 1 as “modestly above” the study mean.  
- Participant 2 shows larger-magnitude deviations and multiple converging high-impact signals: higher anxiety with a very strong sample-level correlation to PSS (r = 0.80), extreme objective sleep loss and timing irregularity, large resting HR elevation (Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = −1.57), and nocturnal HR arousal that maps to PSS. Several of these features have strong sample-level associations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.80; emotional lability r = 0.66; PSQI r = 0.49; pain r ≈ 0.47). The synthesis explicitly concludes Participant 2 is above their study mean and the profile is more severe.

Balance of evidence
- Participant 2 presents with more severe, multi-domain stress indicators (larger Z-scores, extreme objective sleep deprivation and timing disruption, strong correlations between key measures and PSS) than Participant 1. Participant 1’s risk signals are moderate and substantially offset by strong circadian regularity and absence of substance use. Therefore, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS) compared with Participant 1.

  - Severe generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = 1.51) — GAD-7 has very high correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74).  
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5; Z = 1.65) — PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.43).  
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63).  
  - Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3, PAPAS composite) which also correlate positively with PSS.  
  - Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) where NGSE is negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.66).
- These subjective indices are high-magnitude signals and several have large correlations with PSS in this cohort, so they strongly push the inferred PSS above the study mean.
- Although objective physiology (stable circadian metrics, low resting HR, clear amplitude) points toward resilience, those signals are weaker (smaller correlations) and do not outweigh the strong subjective signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some mild risk indicators:
  - Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 43; Z = 0.17). STAI–Trait correlates modestly with PSS (~0.31).
  - Above-average alcohol use frequency (1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), which can co-occur with stress (small correlation here).
  - Modestly reduced circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24-hr autocorrelation negative Zs), which can be associated with stress-related dysregulation.
  - Some intraday HR deviations that could reflect greater daytime cardiovascular demand.
- However, these risk signals are modest in magnitude and have smaller predictive associations with PSS in this study compared with Participant 1’s strong self-report predictors.
- Importantly, Participant 2 also shows multiple protective signals (good sleep quantity and stability, low depressive symptoms, frequent exercise, high happiness/health satisfaction, low RHR/mesor) that the study authors interpret as making overall PSS near the cohort mean rather than clearly above it.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each description is written relative to its own cohort mean. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their study mean (population mean PSS = 20.54) based primarily on very strong subjective indicators that have large correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74, PSQI r = 0.43, BASIS r = 0.63, NGSE r = -0.66). The magnitude (Z-scores) and effect-size correlations of these variables strongly favor higher perceived stress.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). The putative risk indicators for Participant 2 (trait anxiety, alcohol use, reduced interdaily stability) are smaller in magnitude and have weaker associations with PSS in this sample; moreover, several robust protective factors are present.
- Given the relative strength of predictors and their correlations with PSS in each cohort, the evidence that Participant 1 is above their cohort mean is stronger and more decisive than the modest, mixed evidence that Participant 2 is above theirs.

Weighted conclusion
- Overall evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their cohort) compared with Participant 2 (who is described as near the mean with more protective signals).

- These risk signals are present but relatively small in magnitude and counterbalanced by multiple protective features.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = 1.25). In this dataset GAD‑7 is very strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.81).
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83) and corroborating wearable indications of short, late, irregular sleep (median sleep 2 h 31 min, late start, high start-time variability).
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), which strongly inversely correlates with PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS moderate) and emotional/functional disturbance (BASIS‑24 elevations) that have moderate correlations with PSS.
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (resting HR 79.8 bpm, Z = 1.53; mesor Z = 1.49), indicating sustained physiological arousal consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Multiple high-weight indicators converge (severe anxiety + poor sleep + physiological arousal + low self‑efficacy), outweighing the modest protective circadian signals.

- Each summary is written relative to its own sample mean. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as near the population mean (PSS mean 21.61, SD 3.68), with mostly modest risk markers and several strong protective markers (good sleep quantity/stability, low CES‑D, frequent exercise, low resting HR). The net balance in that participant is neutral-to-resilient.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as above the population mean (PSS mean 21.12, SD 7.52). The participant shows multiple strong, converging indicators that in this study have high correlations with PSS (especially GAD‑7 and PSQI), plus physiological evidence of sustained arousal. Although there are some modestly protective rhythm features, the high-weight signals point clearly toward elevated perceived stress.
- Relative magnitude and predictive weight favor Participant 2: Participant 2’s high-anxiety and severe sleep disturbance are stronger and more directly predictive of elevated PSS (based on provided correlations) than Participant 1’s modest trait anxiety and circadian irregularities. Participant 1’s protective physiological and behavioral markers further reduce the likelihood that their PSS markedly exceeds their sample mean.

14,98760,24,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, classified as disturbed sleep), which in this sample correlates with higher PSS.
- Late median sleep-start (~01:58 AM) and elevated night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 102 min), which can increase perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily variability / circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.67, z ≈ 0.88), a metric that in this sample correlates positively with PSS.
- Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (notably 6–9 PM, z up to ≈ 2.9), indicating incomplete evening downregulation that can co-occur with higher subjective stress.
- Low daily socializing time (z ≈ -1.41), which can reduce psychosocial buffering against stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10.5) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale), both described as strongly/moderately correlated with PSS in this sample (GAD-7 correlation reported ~0.77).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8.5) and large night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD = 199 min), both linked with higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z ≈ 1.21), which correlate positively with PSS and can increase perceived stress burden.
- Nocturnal/evening heart-rate elevations around midnight–2am (HR +13.9 to +14.1 bpm, Z ≈ 1.25–1.36) that are reported to correlate with PSS in this dataset.

Comparative consideration within each study’s frame
- Both participants show some indicators of disturbed sleep and nocturnal/evening physiological arousal, which tend to align with higher PSS in their respective samples.
- Participant 1’s sleep disturbance and circadian fragmentation are notable, but they are offset by multiple strong protective signals (low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, strong circadian amplitude). The integrated interpretation provided explicitly rated Participant 1’s PSS as near to slightly below their study mean (population mean = 21.62).
- Participant 2 shows several strong, survey-based predictors of higher PSS (moderate/clinical anxiety, emotional lability) and elevated pain interference; these predictors are stated to have strong correlations with PSS in that sample. The integrated interpretation explicitly rated Participant 2’s PSS as above their study mean (population mean = 20.92), despite some physiological protections (self-efficacy, circadian regularity, low resting HR).

Balance of evidence and determination
- Participant 1: mixed profile, but protective psychological and physiologic markers are prominent; the provided synthesis concluded P1 is near/slightly below their population mean.
- Participant 2: multiple, strongly PSS-associated survey measures (GAD-7, emotional lability), elevated pain, and corroborating nocturnal HR elevations—these together constitute a stronger and more direct signal of above-mean perceived stress in that sample.

- Clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). In this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), making poor perceived sleep a substantive risk factor.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3 ≈ 4.9; PAPAS ~50). These measures are above median and correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54), which can reduce social support and contribute to stress in context.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), which could reflect higher basal autonomic arousal in this individual and sometimes accompanies higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9, z ≈ 1.05) and late sleep timing (~01:58 AM) — sleep complaints and delayed timing are associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily variability / circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ 0.88), which correlates positively with PSS in this sample.
- Low daily social engagement (socializing z ≈ -1.41), a psychosocial vulnerability that can reduce buffering against stress.
- Marked evening heart-rate elevations (hourly HR deviations z up to ≈ 2.9 in 6–9 PM), potentially indicating evening arousal that can exacerbate sleep complaints and stress.

Comparative framing (each description is relative to its own sample mean)
- Both descriptions explicitly place the individual near or slightly below their respective population mean PSS (Participant 1: near/slightly below mean 21.38; Participant 2: near/slightly below mean 21.62).
- Participant 1’s strongest protective signals are very high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 1.41, and NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS, r ≈ -0.63), pronounced circadian/behavioral regularity (large interdaily stability and low intradaily variability), low emotional lability, and minimal substance use. These are robust within-sample protective factors that the summary judges to outweigh the participant’s risk factors, yielding an overall inference near or slightly below that sample’s mean.
- Participant 2’s strongest protective signals are low depression/anxiety symptom scores (CES-D, STAI-T z’s negative), high self-esteem and current happiness, regular exercise, low resting heart rate, and high circadian amplitude — again robust buffers that the summary judges to keep overall PSS near or slightly below that sample’s mean.
- Comparing risk profiles: P1’s notable risks are worse subjective sleep (PSQI 10.5 > P2’s 9) plus pain/interference and interpersonal strain. P2’s risks are sleep timing/fragmentation, low socializing, and evening physiological arousal. The pain/interference and very poor PSQI in P1 are risk factors that have documented moderate correlations with PSS in this dataset; P2’s principal risks are offset by multiple strong physiological and psychological protections (low resting HR, exercise, high amplitude, low depressive/anxiety symptoms).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants are characterized as near or modestly below their population means, but Participant 1 carries additional moderate risk signals (worse PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain, elevated resting HR) that are not present for Participant 2.
- Participant 2 has multiple convergent protective markers (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem/happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, high amplitude) that appear stronger and more numerous than their risk signals.
- Given the relative strengths and the known within-sample correlations (notably strong inverse link between NGSE and PSS but also moderate links of PSQI and pain with PSS), the net pattern suggests Participant 1 is more likely to have a higher perceived stress than Participant 2 (even though both are estimated near/slightly below their respective population means).

19,47810,28,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their cohort)
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05), which is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Short nocturnal sleep (median ~6 h 40 min; Z ≈ −0.65) and frequent naps (0.27 naps/day; Z ≈ +2.34) suggesting compensatory daytime sleep/fatigue.
- Marked intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +2.01) and low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.95), indicating within‑day instability linked to stress and mood disturbance.
- Elevated evening physiological arousal (late acrophase, positive HR deviations in afternoon/evening), which can reflect rumination/activation that impairs recovery.
- Slightly lower happiness and health satisfaction and a small elevation in depressive symptoms (CES‑D).
- Note: several protective traits (below‑average trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low resting HR, low substance use, good academic functioning) mitigate the risk; the profile is described as a mild-to-moderate elevation above the cohort mean (mean = 21.61).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their cohort)
- Very severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16.5; Z = +1.0) and extremely short objective sleep (median ~2 h 38 min; Z ≈ −0.94) — far worse than typical poor sleepers and tightly linked to higher PSS.
- Very late and highly variable sleep timing (median sleep start 03:12 AM; sleep onset SD Z ≈ +1.3) and irregular circadian metrics (IS and autocorrelation substantially below average).
- Marked nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (overnight HR deviations with Z ≈ +1.17 to +1.59), and these nocturnal HR elevations correlate moderately with PSS in this sample.
- Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10). Importantly, anxiety symptoms in this study have a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.78), so even a modest Z for GAD-7 is highly predictive of higher PSS here.
- Some pain‑related interference (PAPAS) that correlates positively with PSS.
- Countervailing protective factors (higher self‑efficacy Z ≈ +0.3 and low emotional lability Z ≈ −0.97) but they are less able to offset the combination of extreme sleep deprivation/irregularity, nocturnal arousal, and anxiety.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means. Participant 1 is characterized as a mild‑to‑moderate elevation above mean PSS (21.61), driven mainly by sleep/circadian fragmentation but moderated by multiple protective traits (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low RHR, low substance use).
- Participant 2 shows more extreme, objectively measured disturbance: dramatically reduced sleep duration, severe sleep timing irregularity, pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal, and presence of clinically relevant anxiety. In Participant 2’s study, anxiety and sleep metrics have strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78 and PSQI r ≈ 0.47), so these features are especially consequential for elevating PSS in that cohort.
- The magnitude and clinical severity of Participant 2’s sleep deprivation/physiologic arousal and the strong link between anxiety and PSS in their sample outweigh Participant 2’s protective factors and also exceed the severity of Participant 1’s stress‑related signals, despite Participant 1’s high intraday fragmentation and elevated napping.
- Therefore, even accounting for different cohort means, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely to have a higher absolute perceived stress score.

7,47810,15,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; z = +0.67) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.53) in this sample.  
- Extremely short wearable-recorded median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) and very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = +0.89) and sleep onset time (SD = 204 min; z = +0.34). Short, irregular sleep is a strong correlate of higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = +2.34), which, while only weakly correlated with PSS in this cohort, are a plausible contextual driver of ongoing perceived stress for this individual.  
- Multiple circadian/rhythm markers indicating reduced regularity and dampened amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24‑h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude), consistent with disrupted daily structure that commonly accompanies higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; z ≈ +1.05) and objectively short nocturnal sleep (median 6 h 40 min; z ≈ −0.65).  
- Markedly elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.83; z ≈ +2.01) and low 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ −0.95) — a pattern of within-day fragmentation that is strongly linked to stress, sleep disturbance, and mood problems.  
- Elevated daytime napping (mean daily naps 0.27; z ≈ +2.34), which often reflects compensatory behavior for poor/nighttime sleep and is associated with fatigue and stress.  
- Pronounced evening physiological arousal (positive hourly HR departures late afternoon/evening, late acrophase) which can reflect stress-related rumination or activity patterns that impair sleep onset.  
- Lower-than-average happiness and health satisfaction and a slight elevation in depressive symptoms (CES‑D modestly above mean), consistent with higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participant summaries are written relative to their cohort means (P1 population mean PSS = 21.29; P2 population mean PSS = 21.61). The two population means are very similar, so comparisons focus on each participant’s pattern relative to their own cohort.  
- Participant 1 shows some strong sleep-related risk signals (very short median sleep, high variability) and a very high interpersonal-problems score; however, several protective/mitigating signs are pronounced (very low current anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, near‑average self‑efficacy, lower resting HR). The summary explicitly concludes P1 is likely near the cohort mean with only a modest tilt above it.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple converging risk signals (subjective poor sleep, short sleep, very high intradaily fragmentation, compensatory napping, evening physiological arousal, some negative affect indicators). Although Participant 2 also has protective traits (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low resting HR, low substance use), the balance in their summary is described as clearly above the cohort mean (mild-to-moderate elevation). Several of P2’s risk indicators have large z-scores (IV and naps ≈ +2.0 to +2.3), indicating substantial deviation from cohort norms in stress‑relevant dimensions.  
- Importantly, P1’s most extreme objective marker is very short sleep, but that participant’s other self-report indicators (notably very low anxiety) and physiological baseline are protective enough that the integrative judgment was only a modest tilt above mean. P2’s risk indicators are broader (sleep quality, fragmentation, daytime compensation, evening arousal, affect) and were judged collectively to place them above their cohort mean.

Overall balance and decision
- Weighing the relative strength, breadth, and cohort-relative extremity of stress‑linked signals, Participant 2 has the more consistent and multi-domain profile pointing to an above-mean PSS (mild-to-moderate elevation) in their cohort, whereas Participant 1 is characterized as near the cohort mean with only a modest tilt above. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

4,17569,31,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51). Anxiety has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75) — one of the strongest single predictors reported.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) and objectively late/short sleep (median start ≈ 01:42; median duration ≈ 4 h 55 m). Sleep measures correlate positively with PSS.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS; Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which are positively associated with PSS.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a strong negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), implying reduced coping resources.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive nocturnal hourly HR deviations (some Zs >2) that map onto hyperarousal and correlate with PSS (e.g., 1–2 AM r ≈ 0.34).
- Integrated pattern: multiple high-impact, converging symptom signals (anxiety, sleep, pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal arousal) that the summary explicitly states produce an above-mean PSS inference.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) and objectively short sleep (median ≈ 5 h 44 m; Z ≈ -1.81), both known to elevate perceived stress.
- Mildly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.46), associated modestly with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Lower current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), which correlates negatively with PSS.
- However, these risk features are counterbalanced by several protective factors (see below), and the summary explicitly places this participant near/slightly below their population mean.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each profile is reported relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is characterized as above their population mean PSS (mean = 20.62); Participant 2 is characterized as near or slightly below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.61).
- Strength and coherence of signals: Participant 1 shows multiple, large, convergent risk signals with substantial Z-scores (anxiety Z ≈ 1.51; NGSE Z ≈ -1.73; nocturnal HR deviations up to Z ≈ 2.8) and strong correlations with PSS — a coherent high-stress profile. Participant 2’s primary risk is short sleep (Z ≈ -1.81), but most other measures are protective (lower trait anxiety/depression, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction, strong interdaily stability and amplitude, low resting HR).
- Relative impact: Because anxiety and self-efficacy have large effect sizes/correlations with PSS in this dataset, Participant 1’s severe anxiety and low self-efficacy likely drive a larger upward deviation in PSS than Participant 2’s mainly sleep-related risk signal drives an upward deviation for them.
- Directional summaries provided in the source text already place Participant 1 above their sample mean and Participant 2 at or slightly below theirs; combining that with the magnitude and number of elevated stress indicators favors Participant 1 as having the higher perceived stress overall.

23,17569,17,24,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), a known stress correlate.
- Objectively short sleep duration (median ~5 h 44 m; Z = -1.81), which commonly elevates perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily heart-rate variability/fragmentation (Z ≈ 0.46), which correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16).
- Reduced current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), which correlates negatively with PSS and thus aligns with higher perceived stress.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (if any)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), which correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 m) and large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), both linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Substantial nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (z-scores > 1; 1–2 AM deviation r ≈ 0.46 with PSS), indicating nocturnal arousal associated with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is described as having a mixed profile but the report concludes their inferred PSS is near to or slightly below their study mean (mean = 21.61). Protective signals (lower depressive/anxiety trait scores, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR) are highlighted, but sleep problems and modest intraday fragmentation are risk factors that could push PSS upward toward the mean.
- Participant 2 also presents a mixed profile but the report concludes they are likely below their study mean (mean = 21.21). Crucially, the low GAD-7 (z ≈ -1.29) and higher self-efficacy (NGSE; r = -0.65 with PSS) are strong predictors of lower PSS in that sample. Although sleep disturbance and nocturnal arousal are severe for this participant, the trait measures that have larger correlations with PSS outweigh those sleep signals in the investigators’ integrated inference.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants show sleep-related risk indicators, and Participant 2’s sleep disturbance is objectively more severe (shorter median sleep, higher PSQI) and shows stronger nocturnal HR deviations.
- However, the relative predictive weights matter: Participant 2’s daytime/trait measures (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy) have large correlations with PSS in that sample and are taken as dominant protective signals, leading to an overall inference of PSS below the population mean.
- Participant 1’s protective signals are present but generally weaker in their associations with PSS (smaller correlations), and the summary explicitly places Participant 1’s inferred PSS near to or only slightly below their mean — i.e., closer to the population average than Participant 2 is to theirs.
- Therefore, relative to their respective sample means and given the described strengths of predictors, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (or at least a PSS nearer to the mean), while Participant 2 is more likely to be further below their population mean.

These measures have large correlations with PSS in the cohort and collectively point to elevated perceived stress.  
- Pain and functional interference: PEG‑3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55 (both positively correlated with PSS, r ≈ 0.47–0.50), suggesting ongoing somatic burden that plausibly elevates stress.  
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations during some late-night hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with arousal-linked stress signatures.  
- Integrative note: Although wearable circadian metrics (high amplitude, strong 24‑h autocorrelation, long objective sleep opportunity) are protective, the strongest predictors in this dataset are the self‑report measures listed above, and the summary explicitly infers PSS above the population mean (20.75).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Minor/weaker signals that could reflect stress: modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.46; small positive correlation with PSS), pronounced daytime HR peaks (e.g., 1–2pm Z = 2.22), modest weekly alcohol use (Z ≈ 1.0), and slightly below‑average momentary happiness (Z = −0.53).  
- Integrative note: these signals are characterized in the summary as secondary/weak and have small correlations with PSS in the cohort; the overall profile is described as below the sample mean (21.62).

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is framed relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is explicitly interpreted as above their population mean (20.75) based primarily on multiple strong self‑report predictors that have high correlations with PSS in that cohort (notably GAD‑7 and Emotional Lability). Participant 2 is explicitly interpreted as below their population mean (21.62) with several strong protective signals (low depressive and trait‑anxiety scores, high health satisfaction and self‑esteem, very high circadian amplitude Z = 1.9, and low resting HR Z = −1.29).  
- The magnitude and predictive weight of Participant 1’s self‑report stress signals are larger and more directly tied to PSS in their dataset than the weaker stress hints in Participant 2. Participant 2’s risk signals are relatively small and outweighed by robust protective signals.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
- Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their study population than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62); NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.69), so this is a sizable risk factor.
- Elevated cardiac markers associated with stress: higher mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ +0.6–0.7) and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (Zs up to ≈ +1.38), which in this cohort are positively associated with PSS.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83), indicating irregular daily timing that is modestly associated with higher PSS.

Mitigating signals noted: low-to-mild current anxiety (GAD-7 Z = -0.76), relatively long median sleep duration (Z ≈ +0.92), low intradaily variability (Z = -1.28), slightly lower emotional lability (Z = -0.37). These temper but do not negate the multiple moderate-to-strong stress-related signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)

- Pronounced daytime heart-rate peaks (e.g., 1–2 pm Z ≈ +2.22) and some mid-day cardiovascular arousal, which could reflect situational stressors.
- Modest weekly alcohol use (Z ≈ +1.0) and slightly reduced momentary happiness (Z ≈ -0.53); these are weakly associated with higher PSS in this cohort.

Mitigating/strong protective signals for Participant 2 (supporting below-mean PSS)
- Low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES-D Z ≈ -0.76; STAI-T Z ≈ -0.62).
- Very high health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.8) and above-average self‑esteem (Z ≈ +0.82).
- Strong circadian robustness (amplitude Z ≈ +1.9; interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.0; 24-h autocorr Z ≈ +1.23).
- Low resting heart rate (47.3 bpm; Z ≈ -1.29) and generally adequate sleep (PSQI Z ≈ -0.8).
- The integrated summary explicitly concludes this participant is likely below the population mean PSS.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Participant 1’s profile contains multiple moderate-to-strong indicators that are directly and positively associated with PSS in that sample (poor PSQI, high PAPAS, low NGSE with strong correlations to PSS, and nocturnal HR elevations). These are not merely weak or isolated signals; several have medium correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2’s profile is dominated by robust protective signals (low depression/anxiety, very high health satisfaction, high circadian amplitude/stability, low RHR, good PSQI) and only a few weaker/ambiguous risk signals (modest IV, daytime HR peaks, alcohol). The strongest signals point toward below-mean perceived stress.
- Both summaries explicitly interpret Participant 1 as above-mean and Participant 2 as below-mean relative to their respective population means. Given the number, magnitude, and strength of stress-associated indicators for Participant 1 versus the stronger protective and larger-magnitude signals for Participant 2, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely has the higher PSS score.

- Extreme objective sleep disruption: median nightly sleep ~2 h 38 min (Z = −0.94), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median start 03:12, SD Z = +1.3) — patterns strongly associated with increased stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart‑rate deviations (e.g., +13.54 bpm at 1–2 AM, +9.79 bpm at 3–4 AM; Zs ≈ +1.2–+1.6) with moderate correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).

- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation consistent with nocturnal arousal and shifted schedule (interdaily stability and autocorrelation low, intradaily variability elevated).

Comparative within‑frame reasoning:
- Each summary is written relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is characterized as having perceived stress “near the sample mean or modestly below” their study mean PSS = 21.62. The stress‑related signals that push upward are modest and have small correlations with PSS; several strong protective psychosocial and behavioral factors (low depressive symptoms, high happiness and self‑esteem, regular adequate sleep duration, frequent exercise, low substance use) argue for a near/below‑mean PSS within that cohort.
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely above their study mean PSS = 20.75. The upward signals for Participant 2 are stronger both in magnitude and in correlation with PSS (notably GAD‑7’s very strong relation to PSS, severe subjective plus objective sleep disruption, and nocturnal HR elevation). Although Participant 2 has protective traits (higher self‑efficacy, low emotional lability), the primary risk signals are more numerous, larger, and tied to metrics that correlate substantially with PSS in that sample.
- Relative weighting: Participant 2’s deviations are both larger in effect size (extreme short/irregular sleep and notable nocturnal HR elevation) and tied to variables with higher sample correlations with PSS (GAD‑7, PSQI, pain). Participant 1’s risk indicators are weaker and offset by multiple strong protective factors.

- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93). PAPAS also correlates substantially with PSS (r = 0.53), supporting higher perceived stress.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62). NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS in the sample (r = −0.69), so below-average self-efficacy points toward higher stress.

- Slightly elevated resting heart rate (59.8 bpm; Z ≈ +0.20) and a PSQI = 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), which could push perceived stress upward to some degree.
- The summary notes these signals could create a plausible pathway to higher stress but characterizes their associations as modest.

Comparative framing within each study population
- Participant 1’s stress-related indicators are described as strongly tied to PSS in that sample (large correlations for PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53; NGSE r ≈ −0.69; nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.47). The integrated interpretation explicitly places Participant 1 above their study population mean (21.29).
- Participant 2’s stress-related indicators are mainly objective circadian fragmentation metrics whose correlations with PSS are modest (r ≈ 0.12–0.17). Conversely, Participant 2 has multiple, relatively strong protective psychosocial and behavioral indicators (low depression, high momentary happiness, regular adequate sleep duration/timing, frequent exercise, low substance use). The integrated interpretation places Participant 2 near or modestly below their population mean (21.62).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Strength and relevance of associations: Participant 1’s strongest positive indicators (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE, nocturnal HR) have larger sample-level correlations with PSS than Participant 2’s principal stress signals (circadian fragmentation metrics). That makes Participant 1’s above-mean inference more compelling.
- Convergence vs. protection: Participant 1 shows multiple converging signals (subjective sleep, pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal physiology) that are each meaningfully associated with PSS, whereas Participant 2’s circadian/physiologic warning signs are counterbalanced by several strong psychosocial and behavioral protective factors.
- Explicit study-relative conclusions: The summaries themselves conclude Participant 1 is likely above their mean, while Participant 2 is near or slightly below theirs.

- Convergent multi-domain pattern: several independent measures (self-report and wearable physiology) converge on a stress-consistent profile above the study mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Objective circadian fragmentation: elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.3), slightly reduced interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation — features associated in the literature with higher stress (though correlations here are small).
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:56 AM), which can be associated with evening arousal or lifestyle factors linked to stress.
- Behavioral risk indicator: recreational drug use reported ~1–2 times per week (very high z ≈ 5.44), which could indicate coping-related behavior or elevated stress in some contexts.
- Some late-evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., 10–11 PM deviation z ≈ 1.65) that might reflect evening arousal.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each description is framed relative to its own sample mean: Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their sample mean PSS (sample mean = 20.92), whereas Participant 2 is inferred to be below their sample mean PSS (sample mean = 21.62).
- Strength and consistency of indicators: Participant 1 shows multiple, strongly elevated self-report measures that have high correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78) plus corroborating severe wearable findings (extremely short sleep and nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS). These indicators are both severe in magnitude and mutually consistent.
- Participant 2 shows a mixture of some stress-related wearable signals (circadian fragmentation, late sleep, drug use) but also multiple strong protective/low-symptom indicators (low CES-D and STAI-T, high self-esteem and happiness, adequate stable sleep duration, low resting HR). The wearable stress signals for Participant 2 have smaller correlations with PSS in the dataset, and many major indicators point toward lower stress.
- Relative severity: Participant 1’s physiological and symptom severity (e.g., median sleep ~3 hours, severe anxiety) is much more extreme than the stress-like features in Participant 2 (which are milder or counterbalanced by strong protective factors). Even given slightly different population means, the convergent, severe, and PSS-correlated signals for Participant 1 make a higher absolute perceived stress more likely.

Weighted conclusion
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

9,89161,12,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.46), so this strongly supports higher perceived stress.
- Extremely short objective sleep duration (median ≈ 3 h 27 min; Z ≈ -0.66 for duration but magnitude is clinically extreme) plus high night-to-night variability and increased napping — objective sleep restriction and instability are plausibly major contributors to elevated PSS.
- High intradaily variability (IV = 0.64, Z = 2.29), which in the sample trends with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.24), indicating circadian/behavioral fragmentation linked to stress.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 0.94) could add psychosocial stressors (even though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.3) and slightly reduced interdaily stability/autocorrelation, which in the study correlate positively (though modestly) with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), indicating some circadian fragmentation associated with higher stress.
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:56 AM) and some late-evening heart-rate elevations — patterns that can reflect evening arousal or lifestyle stressors for some people.
- Frequent recreational drug use (reported 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 5.44) is an extreme behavioral outlier that may reflect coping or risk behaviors that, in some contexts, accompany higher perceived stress (though its direct correlation with PSS in this sample is reported as small).

Comparative considerations within each population frame
- Both participant summaries explicitly infer PSS below their respective population means overall. Those inferences rest on multiple indicators.
- Strength and relevance of risk signals differ: Participant 1’s strongest above-mean signals are severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance and very high intradaily variability; the PSQI–PSS correlation is moderate (r ≈ 0.46), suggesting sleep in this sample is a relatively important predictor of PSS. These sleep signals are unusually extreme (very short median sleep) and therefore carry substantial weight.
- Participant 2’s above-mean signals (circadian fragmentation, late sleep timing, recreational drug use) are either less strongly correlated with PSS in the study (lower r values) or noted as behavioral/contextual (drug use correlates only weakly with PSS in this sample). Meanwhile, Participant 2 shows multiple, strongly protective self-report indicators (low CES-D and STAI-T; high self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction) that have clearer inverse associations with PSS.
- Participant 1 also has several strong protective indicators (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) that strongly predict lower PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). However, the extremity of the sleep pathology in Participant 1 (very short objective sleep and high IV) is a notable countervailing factor with a nontrivial correlation to PSS.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2’s risk features are present but relatively moderate in their predictive strength for PSS within the sample, and Participant 2 has many robust protective indicators (low mood/anxiety, high well-being, adequate stable sleep, low resting HR).
- Participant 1 presents an unusual and severe sleep phenotype (very short objective sleep and high fragmentation) that, given the moderate sleep–PSS association in this sample, is a stronger indicator of elevated perceived stress than Participant 2’s more modest circadian/behavioral risk signals.
- Overall, although both profiles were interpreted by their study summaries as more consistent with below-mean PSS, the severity and PSS-relevance of Participant 1’s sleep disturbance make it more likely that Participant 1 would have a higher PSS (i.e., worse perceived stress) than Participant 2 when comparing them relative to their respective population means.

19,88185,28,20,"Potential reasons why Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which is associated with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Short and late-timed sleep: median wearable sleep ~6 h 37 m (Z = -0.70) and very late median sleep start (~02:25) — sleep insufficiency and late timing are linked to higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal/early-morning physiological arousal: modest positive correlations between early-morning hourly HR deviations and PSS (correlations ~0.19–0.21) and a small positive resting/mean HR–PSS association (r ≈ 0.14).
- Coping/behavior signal with small positive association: unusually high music listening (Z = 2.06), which in this cohort has a small positive correlation with PSS and could reflect stress-related coping.

Potential reasons why Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Severe subjective and objective sleep disruption: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = 1.0) and extremely short median sleep (2 h 38 m, Z = -0.94) with very late sleep onset (03:12 AM) and high night-to-night variability — PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS (r = 0.47).
- Pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal: large overnight HR elevations (e.g., +13.54 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = 1.17; +9.79 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = 1.59) that have moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety). Anxiety showed the strongest cohort association with PSS (r = 0.78), making this a major predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Pain-related functional interference: PAPAS = 65 with moderate positive correlation to PSS (r = 0.48).
- Circadian dysregulation: low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability indicating shifted/unstable rhythms, which commonly co-occur with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Directional labels: Participant 1’s profile is characterized as being likely below their study mean (21.62); Participant 2’s profile is characterized as likely above their study mean (20.75). Thus each description already places P1 lower-than-average for their cohort and P2 higher-than-average for theirs.
- Strength and number of predictors favoring high PSS: Participant 2 has multiple, relatively strong predictors of higher perceived stress (moderate-to-strong cohort correlations: GAD-7 r = 0.78; PSQI r = 0.47; pain r = 0.48; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.32–0.38), plus extreme objective sleep impairment (very short sleep, high variability). Participant 1’s indicators of higher stress are fewer and weaker (sleep disturbance and modest early-morning HR associations), while many strong indicators (low depression/anxiety, high happiness, stable circadian metrics, regular exercise) point toward lower stress.
- Population-mean context: Although the two participants’ population means differ slightly (P1 mean 21.62; P2 mean 20.75), the within-cohort signals for P2 (especially the strong anxiety–PSS relationship and extreme sleep loss) make it much more likely that P2’s absolute PSS exceeds P1’s, despite the small difference in study means.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The preponderance of robust, converging indicators of high perceived stress for Participant 2 (severe objective/subjective sleep loss, nocturnal physiological arousal, and clinically meaningful anxiety with a very strong cohort correlation to PSS) outweighs the limited and weaker stress-congruent signals for Participant 1 (mainly sleep timing/quality concerns and modest nocturnal HR deviations) who otherwise shows strong protective features.
- Therefore Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; z = 0.67; classified “Disturbed Sleep”), a measure that correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).  
- Extremely short median wearable sleep (4 h 22 m) and very large night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 216 min; z = 0.89) and onset time (SD = 204 min; z = 0.34). Short, fragmented, and irregular sleep patterns are strong correlates of higher perceived stress.  
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude; HR amplitude z ≈ -0.84), consistent with disrupted daily structure that commonly co-occurs with elevated stress.  
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal subscale z = 2.34), a contextual risk factor that can increase ongoing perceived stress.  
- Evening HR elevations and blunted circadian HR amplitude, which can reflect dysregulated physiological patterns linked to stress (though these map imperfectly to PSS in the cohort).

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or not elevated) PSS score
- Very low current anxiety (GAD-7 z = -1.38), low pain and pain interference (PAPAS z = -1.29), and low emotional lability (z = -1.27), each arguing against high concurrent subjective distress.  
- Near-average self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.07), which in this cohort is strongly associated with lower PSS (r ≈ -0.66).  
- Lower resting HR / MESOR (resting HR ≈ 59 bpm; MESOR ≈ 64 bpm), consistent with lower tonic sympathetic arousal in many contexts.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, “Disturbed Sleep”) and modestly short median wearable sleep (6 h 37 m; z = -0.70).  
- Very late typical sleep onset (~02:25), which can contribute to sleep insufficiency and has been associated with higher stress in some studies.  
- Small but positive associations between early-morning HR deviations and PSS (hourly correlations ~0.19–0.21 for some windows) and modest positive resting/mean HR correlations with PSS in the cohort.  
- An activity (listening to music) that, while possibly adaptive, shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample (music z = 2.06).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or not elevated) PSS score
- Low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES-D z = -0.66; STAI-Trait z = -1.22), both direct self-report indicators strongly consistent with lower perceived stress.  
- High current happiness (z = 1.64), above-average trust, regular socializing (z ≈ 0.95), and strong academic performance — psychosocial supports associated with lower stress.  
- Robust circadian physiology: high interdaily stability (z = 1.33) and large HR amplitude (z = 1.06), both negatively correlated with PSS in the cohort.  
- Regular exercise (z = 1.07) and absence of substance use, both protective against higher perceived stress.  
- Resting HR near/slightly below mean (z ≈ -0.10), consistent with lower chronic autonomic arousal.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both descriptions are given relative to their own study population means. Participant 1’s strongest stress-related signals are pronounced sleep pathology (very short sleep, extreme variability, high PSQI) and marked interpersonal strain (very high z on BASIS-24 Interpersonal), which are substantial risk indicators for elevated perceived stress in that cohort. Protective signals for Participant 1 (very low anxiety, low pain, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR) are meaningful but generally appear less severe than the sleep/interpersonal problems in their expected effect on perceived stress. The study-level interpretation for Participant 1 was “near the mean with a modest tilt toward above the mean.”  
- Participant 2 shows multiple strong and convergent indicators of lower stress relative to their population (low depression/anxiety, high happiness, stable circadian physiology, regular exercise, social functioning), while the countervailing signals center mainly on moderately short/late sleep and some small nocturnal HR correlations. The study-level interpretation for Participant 2 was that their profile is “more consistent with perceived stress below the sample mean.”  
- Comparing the balance of evidence in their respective frames: Participant 1’s stress-related signals are more severe and directly tied to known PSS correlates (extreme sleep restriction/irregularity and high interpersonal strain), whereas Participant 2’s stress-related signals are milder and outweighed by multiple protective factors. Therefore, relative to their own cohorts, Participant 1 is more likely to be at or above their population mean PSS than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Substantially elevated anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 12 (z = 0.46) and the GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77), making this a high-impact indicator of above-mean perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 17.5 (z = 1.32) with a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45); this is a large deviation and a clear stress-related signal.
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight hourly heart-rate deviations above the sample mean (e.g., +11.92 bpm at midnight–1am, z ≈ 1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39), suggesting impaired overnight recovery.
- Reduced self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ -0.66) — consistent with higher perceived stress through lower coping resources.
- Emotional lability and elevated substance-related score (BASIS-24 subscale z ≈ 1.5) add further stress-relevant signals.
- Although some protective signals exist (adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR, reasonable circadian metrics), the strongest and most directly PSS-correlated indicators (anxiety and very disturbed subjective sleep plus nighttime HR elevations) point toward a clearly above-mean PSS for this participant.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean):
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI trait = 42 (z ≈ 0.07, classified “anxious”) and CES-D = 15 (z ≈ 0.18); both have modest positive correlations with PSS here (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28).
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8 (z ≈ 0.59), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian/physiological markers linked to stress: higher intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.60), reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -0.72), low mesor with pronounced daytime HR peaks—these are consistent with some heightened or fragmented physiological activation and have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS in this sample.
- However, several protective/mitigating features reduce the likelihood of a strongly elevated PSS relative to this study population: adequate objective sleep duration, frequent exercise (z ≈ 1.07), low resting HR (z ≈ -0.93), modest interdaily stability—these buffer perceived stress and are why the profile is judged close to the sample mean with only a modest upward tilt.

Comparative, within-frame weighing of evidence:
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s highest-impact predictors (GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77; PSQI with z = 1.32 and r ≈ 0.45) are larger in magnitude and more directly tied to PSS than Participant 2’s symptom signals (STAI/CES-D correlations ≈ 0.3 and smaller z-scores). Participant 1 also shows clear nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS, whereas Participant 2’s heart-rate signs are a mix of daytime peaks and a blunted amplitude—less straightforwardly indicative of higher perceived stress and partially offset by strong fitness/protective markers (low RHR, regular exercise).
- Net balance: Participant 1’s deviations most predictive of PSS are larger and more convergent (psychological symptoms + disturbed subjective sleep + nocturnal physiological arousal), while Participant 2’s stress-relevant signals are milder and more balanced by protective behaviors/physiology.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; Z = 0.59), a construct that correlates with higher PSS.
- Circadian/physiological markers associated with stress: increased intradaily variability (Z = 0.60), reduced circadian amplitude (Z = -0.72) and low mesor (Z = -1.55), plus pronounced daytime HR elevations at specific hours — all of which have small-to-moderate positive associations with PSS in this dataset.
- Reduced reported happiness and lower socializing (Z’s ≈ -0.5 to -0.6), which can contribute to higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might not have markedly higher PSS (mitigating evidence):
- Adequate objective sleep duration (≈7 h 18 min; Z = 0.14) and modestly consistent sleep timing.
- Frequent exercise (Z = 1.07) and low resting heart rate (Z = -0.93), both protective against high perceived stress.
- Interdaily stability slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.33) and overall behavioral markers that are mixed rather than uniformly adverse.
- Net inference from description: only a modest tilt above the study mean rather than a large elevation.

- Multiple self-report measures that strongly predict PSS are elevated: GAD-7 = 8 (and GAD-7 correlates very strongly with PSS, r ≈ 0.77), high PSQI (13; r ≈ 0.49), elevated emotional lability (Z = 0.63; r ≈ 0.66), and pain/interference (PEG-3; r ≈ 0.44). Low self-efficacy is also present and strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.65).
- Wearable physiology shows pronounced stress-like signatures: high resting HR (Z = 1.19) and MESOR (Z = 1.24), reduced circadian amplitude (Z = -1.05), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.07), and low interdaily stability (Z = -0.46).
- Objective sleep is markedly disturbed: extremely short median nightly sleep (≈1 h 39 min; Z = -1.27), very late sleep timing (~04:36 AM), and compensatory naps (Z = 1.24). Early-morning HR elevations (1–8 AM) also align with higher PSS.
- The description explicitly concludes the participant is likely above their study mean PSS, with multiple independent, strongly correlated indicators supporting that.

Reasons Participant 2 might not have markedly higher PSS (mitigating evidence):
- Absolute GAD-7 level is in the mild range (not moderate/severe).
- Some wearable-to-PSS correlations are inconsistent in the sample and the very short objective sleep may reflect device non-wear or artifact (noted caveat).
- Substance-use problems are low (Z ≈ -0.86), which reduces some risk burden.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing of evidence:
- Both participants are described relative to their own sample means and both show some indicators of elevated stress, but the magnitude and coherence of indicators differ.
- Participant 1 shows modest, mixed signals: small-to-moderate elevations on self-report anxiety/depression and subjective sleep disturbance, some circadian fragmentation, but also several protective factors (adequate objective sleep, frequent exercise, low resting HR). The net inference was “near the mean with a modest tilt upward.”
- Participant 2 shows multiple, large and converging signals that are strongly correlated with PSS in that sample: anxiety and emotional-lability measures with high PSS correlations, pronounced objective physiological activation (elevated resting HR/MESOR), strong circadian disruption (reduced amplitude, high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability), and extremely short/late objective sleep. Even with caveats about some measurement inconsistencies, the number, magnitude (Z-scores often >1), and high correlations of key measures make a stronger case that Participant 2’s perceived stress is elevated relative to their sample mean than Participant 1’s is relative to theirs.

16,77711,23,17,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = 1.06) — a moderate positive correlate of PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.32).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, above clinical cutoff), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Low self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.43) and modestly low health satisfaction — psychosocial vulnerabilities that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral markers of irregularity (late sleep timing ≈ 01:02 AM; lower interdaily stability z = -0.57) that can exacerbate stress.
- Daytime cardiovascular activation peaks (midday HR deviations), which may reflect periods of physiological arousal tied to demands.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Marked subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 12) and PSQI has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r = 0.50).
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.65).
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone (resting HR z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18) and nocturnal HR elevations (1–4 AM) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), suggesting reduced overnight recovery.
- Very long and highly variable sleep duration (median 12 h, z = 2.26; SD z = 2.38), which may reflect dysregulation linked to stress in other contexts.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is given relative to its own study population mean PSS. Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely above their population mean (Population mean PSS = 21.63), driven chiefly by psychological signals (trait anxiety, PSQI, low self-esteem) despite some physiological resilience (low resting HR, preserved nocturnal dips, good academic functioning).
- Participant 2’s summary concludes the participant is near their population mean (Population mean PSS = 20.96). Although Participant 2 has strong domain-specific risk signals (severe PSQI, emotional lability, elevated resting/nocturnal HR), they also show multiple protective/offsetting signals (low pain burden, intact interpersonal functioning, only mild GAD-7), and the narrative emphasizes that several wearable metrics have weak correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Relative strength and consistency of signals: Participant 1’s psychosocial risk indicators (notably trait anxiety and clinically meaningful PSQI) are clear, convergent stress correlates relative to their cohort, and the summary explicitly rates them as above-mean PSS. Participant 2 has important physiological and sleep-arousal signals that could elevate PSS, but these are weighed against stronger protective survey domains and the summary explicitly rates them as near-mean rather than clearly above.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
- Overall balance: Participant 1 is described as having a modest but coherent elevation in perceived stress relative to their cohort, while Participant 2 is described as near their cohort mean with mixed risk/protective signals. Therefore Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher PSS score.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (clinical cutoff exceeded), which moderately correlates with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.42). This is the primary signal that could push their PSS upward relative to peers.
- Small-to-moderate associations of some nocturnal heart-rate deviations with PSS (early-morning HR Z ≈ -2 to -2.7; correlations r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These are weaker signals but could contribute modestly.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 52 (Z = +1.06). Trait anxiety is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.32) and is the strongest psychological indicator here for increased perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (above clinical cutoff), also associated with higher PSS.
- Low self-esteem: RSES Z = -1.43, a psychosocial vulnerability that tends to co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Less regular daily schedule and somewhat later sleep timing (interdaily stability Z = -0.57; sleep start ≈ 01:02 AM), behavioral features that can increase stress risk or reduce resilience.
- Modestly shorter sleep duration (median 6 h 55 m, Z = -0.33), potentially adding to stress burden.
- Although some physiological features are protective, pronounced midday HR peaks indicate notable daytime physiological activation (though correlations with PSS are small and ambiguous).

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is explicitly framed vs its own population mean. Participant 1 is characterized as likely below their study mean PSS (population mean 21.5) based on very strong protective signals: maximum NGSE (Z = +1.79) and very low GAD-7 (Z = -1.38), both of which have strong sample correlations with PSS (NGSE r = -0.60; GAD–PSS r = +0.75). Objective circadian regularity and an unusually low resting heart rate (RHR Z = -2.23) are additional strong indicators favoring lower perceived stress. The main countervailing factor is the PSQI = 7, but this is a single moderate signal against multiple strong protective signals.
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely above their study mean PSS (population mean 21.63). Key risk signals (trait anxiety Z = +1.06, PSQI = 7, low self-esteem Z = -1.43, less regular schedule) converge toward higher perceived stress. Protective signals (moderately low RHR Z = -0.68, good academic performance, some rhythm stability) are present but generally weaker in magnitude and/or less directly linked to PSS than Participant 1’s strong protective markers.
- Comparing magnitudes: Participant 1’s strongest indicators (near-maximal self-efficacy, very low GAD, very low RHR and high circadian stability) are more extreme and have larger sample-level associations with PSS than Participant 2’s strongest risk indicators. Participant 2 nevertheless shows multiple convergent psychosocial risk factors (trait anxiety, PSQI, low self-esteem) that collectively point to an elevated PSS relative to their cohort.

Overall determination
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (i.e., a higher PSS relative to their study population) than Participant 1.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed) — subjective sleep complaints commonly accompany higher perceived stress.
- Late habitual sleep onset (median ~01:34 AM) and circadian delay, which can be associated with daytime dysfunction and stress.
- Low physical activity (reports no exercise; large negative z’s), which is associated with worse stress/coping.
- High passive media use and long socializing/listening-to-music times (positive z’s), behaviors often correlated with poorer coping or avoidance.
- Low current happiness (z ≈ -0.53), low health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2), and recent academic decline (GPA 1.90) — psychosocial stressors that could elevate perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10), a strong predictor of PSS in this sample (correlation ≈ 0.77) and crossing a clinical screening threshold.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) with a moderate-to-strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86), measures that correlate moderately with higher PSS.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9), another strong correlate of PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Objective sleep deprivation (median ~3 h 55 min) and blunted/irregular circadian HR rhythm (low amplitude and low interdaily stability), which are physiologically linked to higher stress.
- While there are protective factors (high general self-efficacy, low interpersonal problems, low resting HR), they are described as attenuating but not fully offsetting the strong risk signals.

Within-population framing and comparative weighing
- Each description is relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as ""near the mean"" (study mean = 21.63) with several protective physiological and symptom indicators (low resting HR, low trait anxiety/depression, robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability) that offset behavioral/subjective stressors. The net balance in that within-sample frame is near-average perceived stress.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as above the mean (study mean = 21.04). Multiple strong, highly PSS-associated self-report indicators (notably GAD-7, PSQI, pain measures, emotional lability) are elevated; these measures have relatively large correlations with PSS in that cohort and thus provide stronger and more direct evidence of elevated perceived stress than the risk indicators for Participant 1.
- The magnitude and number of high-correlation risk factors for Participant 2 outweigh the moderate behavioral risk signals for Participant 1, especially given Participant 1’s stronger physiological and symptom-level protections.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed) despite long objective sleep — could reflect poor sleep quality/perception linked to stress.
- Late habitual sleep onset (~1:34 AM) and possible circadian misalignment associated with daytime impairment and stress.
- Low current happiness (z ≈ -0.53) and low health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2), which can elevate perceived stress.
- Recent academic decline (most recent term GPA 1.90) — a concrete psychosocial stressor.
- Very low reported exercise (z’s ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and high passive media/social time (socializing z ≈ +2.53, music z ≈ +2.06, internet z ≈ +1.52) — behavioral patterns linked to higher stress and poorer coping.
- Evening peaks in heart-rate deviation (7–8 PM) could reflect augmented evening arousal (though overall physiology leans toward low arousal).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, “Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI moderately correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) and could raise perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning 2–6 AM values with Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), so certain nocturnal cardiovascular patterns could modestly associate with higher stress.

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- The descriptions are relative to each study’s mean PSS. Participant 1 is judged “near the mean” of a mean PSS = 21.63 (i.e., around average stress within their sample). Participant 2 is judged below their study mean PSS = 21.5 (i.e., lower-than-average stress within that sample).
- Participant 1 has multiple moderate stress-related signals (subjective sleep problems, late sleep timing, low exercise, low happiness/health satisfaction, academic decline, heavy passive media use). Although physiological measures largely indicate low basal arousal, the number and variety of psychosocial and behavioral stressors provide plausible reasons for perceived stress at or above the sample mean.
- Participant 2 has one primary negative signal (PSQI sleep disturbance) and some small HR-based associations, but very strong protective signals (maximal self-efficacy, minimal anxiety, low interpersonal/substance problems, strong circadian stability and amplitude, very low RHR). The magnitude of protective indicators (large negative NGSE–PSS relation; very low GAD) outweighs the isolated sleep complaint, supporting a below-mean PSS placement.
- Therefore, when comparing the two within their respective study frames, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (closer to or at the population mean) than Participant 2 (who appears below their population mean).

- Subjective and objective sleep problems: PSQI = 6 (disturbed), short median sleep (~6 h 2 min, z ≈ −1.43), and late sleep onset (~1:43 AM) — sleep disturbance is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Reduced interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythm (value 0.33, z ≈ −0.66), which can reflect inconsistent day‑to‑day scheduling linked to greater stress in some studies.
- Lower momentary happiness (current = 3.0, z ≈ −0.53), modestly inversely related to stress in this cohort.
Note: These sleep/circadian signals are flagged as risks but the summary emphasizes they are weaker or more modest predictors in this sample compared with the participant’s stronger protective indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 12 (disturbed). PSQI correlates with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.50).
- Marked emotional lability: BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability = 8.33 (z = 0.53), which has a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.65) and is a potent predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal: elevated heart-rate deviations at 1–4 AM (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM), with these nocturnal deviations moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (resting HR = 78.21 bpm, z = 1.37; mesor = 85.61, z = 1.18), consistent with higher baseline autonomic tone that often accompanies higher stress.
- Large and unstable sleep quantity (median ~12 h, z = 2.26; night-to-night SD = 320 min, z = 2.38), which, while weakly correlated with PSS in this dataset, reflect substantial sleep/circadian dysregulation that can accompany stress-related pathology.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- The Participant 1 profile is explicitly interpreted in its report as likely below the Population PSS mean (21.62). Its strongest signals that relate to lower perceived stress are lower depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (z ≈ −0.5 to −0.7), higher self‑esteem, regular exercise, and lower resting HR/mesor — several of which have reasonably consistent relations to PSS in this sample.
- The Participant 2 profile is interpreted as near the Population PSS mean (20.96) but contains several domain-specific signals that are more directly and strongly associated with higher PSS in this dataset (notably emotional lability r ≈ 0.65, PSQI r ≈ 0.50, and nocturnal HR elevations r ≈ 0.36–0.41). Participant 2 also shows markedly elevated resting HR/mesor (z > 1) and pronounced sleep instability, which together form a stronger pattern of physiological/subjective arousal than seen in Participant 1.
- In short, relative to their respective study populations, Participant 1 is described as leaning below-average stress, whereas Participant 2 is described as average-to-somewhat-elevated with several high-confidence indicators of stress. The predictors that favor higher PSS in Participant 2 are both more numerous and include variables with larger correlations to PSS in this sample (emotional lability, PSQI, nocturnal HR).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Given Participant 1’s overall pattern of protective traits and lower physiological baselines and the report’s explicit inference of below-mean perceived stress, versus Participant 2’s multiple convergent signals tied to higher PSS (some with strong correlations), Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

22,75438,10,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (from their description, relative to their population)
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83). PSQI is a moderate–strong predictor of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58).
- Wearable sleep metric indicates extremely short median sleep (≈1 h 44 min; Z ≈ −1.24) that corroborates subjective sleep disturbance and suggests nocturnal sleep disruption or non‑wear that nevertheless aligns with elevated PSQI.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 mean 7.78, Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS composite Z ≈ +0.8). Pain/interference have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal (midnight–early morning HR elevations) that have small–moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Net effect in the report: the summary explicitly infers stress near the population mean with a modest upward contribution from sleep disturbance and pain (i.e., likely at-or-slightly-above mean PSS for that cohort).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description, relative to their population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as “disturbed sleep”).
- Shorter objective sleep (median ≈ 6 h 2 min; Z ≈ −1.43) and late sleep timing (median onset ~1:43 AM), both of which are associated with higher PSS in general.
- Reduced interdaily stability of HR rhythm (Z ≈ −0.66) and somewhat lower momentary happiness (Z ≈ −0.53), which have modest links to higher perceived stress.
- However, these sleep/circadian risks are described as smaller effects in this dataset and are explicitly outweighed by stronger protective signals in the participant’s profile.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning and final weighing
- Relative position summaries: Participant 1 is characterized as near the sample mean PSS (population mean 21.5) with a modest uplift due largely to severe subjective sleep problems and elevated pain/interference. Participant 2 is characterized as below their sample mean PSS (population mean 21.62), with stronger and more consistent protective traits (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR, low intradaily variability) that outweigh their sleep/circadian risks.
- Magnitude and quality of risk signals: Participant 1’s sleep signal is much stronger (PSQI = 16 vs PSQI = 6 for P2) and is paired with clinically meaningful pain/interference elevations—both are moderate–strong correlates of PSS in that sample. Participant 2’s sleep risks (PSQI = 6; ~6 h sleep; late timing) are meaningful but described as weaker and counterbalanced by multiple robust protective indicators.
- Net inference: Because Participant 1 shows more pronounced risk indicators that are strongly related to PSS (notably severe subjective sleep disturbance plus pain) and is explicitly inferred to be at-or-slightly-above their cohort mean, while Participant 2 is explicitly inferred to be below their cohort mean with multiple consistent protective signals, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

16,62617,23,17,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (population mean = 21.63)
- Reduced interdaily stability of heart‑rate rhythm (Z = -1.73): lower day‑to‑day schedule regularity has been associated with higher stress and poorer mood in population studies.  
- Reduced cardiac rhythm amplitude (Z = -1.01): blunted circadian modulation can relate to poorer well‑being in some research.  
- Evening HR elevations (positive deviations 7–10 pm) and small positive correlations of some early‑morning HR deviations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.2): suggest episodic physiological arousal that could reflect stressors.  
- These physiological vulnerabilities are moderate in magnitude and could raise perceived stress relative to peers despite strong protective signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (population mean = 20.96)
- High subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 12), and PSQI correlates substantially with PSS in this sample (r = 0.50).  
- Marked emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.65), indicating mood instability is a likely driver of perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal HR elevations (1–4 AM increases of +10.24, +7.34, +4.18 bpm) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), plus elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18) — together indicating higher baseline physiological arousal and poorer overnight recovery.  
- Very long median sleep (12 h, z = 2.26) and very large night‑to‑night variability (SD z = 2.38): unstable and atypical sleep patterns that can accompany stress‑related dysregulation.  
- Although there are protective domains (low pain, good interpersonal functioning, mild anxiety), several strong, PSS‑linked signals point toward higher perceived stress in key domains.

Population-relative framing and comparative reasoning
- Participant 1’s profile is interpreted relative to their study population as overall below the mean PSS; strong self‑report indicators (very low depression/anxiety, high happiness and self‑esteem) and objectively good, regular sleep weigh heavily toward lower perceived stress despite moderate physiological vulnerabilities.  
- Participant 2’s profile is interpreted relative to their own study population as near the mean PSS, but with multiple domain‑specific signals that are directly and strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (notably emotional lability, PSQI, nocturnal HR). Those signals provide clearer, population‑relevant evidence of elevated perceived stress than the physiological vulnerabilities seen in Participant 1.  
- Comparing within each population frame: Participant 1 is characterized as below average stress for their cohort; Participant 2 is at or closer to average with clear domain‑specific elevations that are tied to PSS. Thus, Participant 2 shows stronger, population‑relevant indications of higher perceived stress than Participant 1.

22,62617,10,17,"Participant 1 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Low interdaily stability of heart‑rate rhythm (Z = -1.73): less regular day‑to‑day timing has been associated with higher stress and poorer mood in population studies.  
- Reduced cardiac rhythm amplitude (Z = -1.01): blunted circadian modulation can reflect lower physiological resilience and modestly correlate with worse well‑being.  
- Evening HR elevations and small positive correlations between some early‑morning HR deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.2): episodic evening/overnight physiological arousal could contribute to perceived stress.  
- These physiological/circadian vulnerabilities are moderate in magnitude and could push perceived stress upward despite stronger protective signals.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16.0, Z = 0.83) and strong sample correlation between PSQI and PSS (r = 0.58): a substantive predictor of higher perceived stress.  
- Wearable sleep metrics indicating extremely short median sleep (1 h 44 min, Z = -1.24) and variable sleep start times (start‑time SD ≈ 160 min): even allowing for possible non‑wear or algorithm error, these objective signals align with the PSQI and point to clinically meaningful sleep problems that elevate PSS.  
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 Z = 0.71; PAPAS Z = 0.8), which correlate moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.52–0.56): likely to increase perceived stress.  
- Some nocturnal HR elevations modestly correlated with PSS (r up to ~0.42) that fit with sleep disruption and may raise stress levels.

Comparative reasoning within the population frames
- Participant 1’s profile: convergent, relatively large protective signals (very low depression and trait anxiety Zs, high happiness and self‑esteem, long consistent sleep, regular exercise) outweigh the moderate circadian/physiological vulnerabilities. The summary explicitly concludes PSS is likely below that study’s mean (21.63).  
- Participant 2’s profile: mixed but includes several moderate‑to‑strong risk signals tied to higher PSS (notably PSQI and pain/interference) that the summary identifies as primary drivers of an upward shift; protective signals (low anxiety, high self‑efficacy, robust circadian markers) mitigate but do not fully nullify those risks. The summary places this participant near the cohort mean (21.5), with a modest tendency above the mean driven by sleep and pain.  
- Relative strength of risk vs. protective indicators: P1’s risk indicators are primarily moderate physiological circadian irregularities with small-to-modest correlations to PSS, whereas P2 has at least two domain signals (sleep disturbance and pain) that are both elevated and moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS in their sample. Even though P2 has notable protective traits, the presence of strong, salient correlates of higher perceived stress (sleep + pain) makes it more likely their PSS is higher relative to their cohort than P1 is relative to theirs.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",62617,NetHealth,17,22,Pain,10
13,77789,28,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Multiple self-report measures that strongly correlate with PSS are elevated: mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5; GAD-PSS r = 0.80), emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 6.33; r = 0.67), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; r = 0.59). These are high-weight predictors in the dataset.
- Pain and functional interference are nontrivial (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) and both positively correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations during specific hours (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45, 2–3am r = 0.40) are associated with higher PSS and are present.
- The study write-up explicitly concludes the balance of evidence supports perceived stress above the population mean (population mean 20.75).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 20; z ≈ +0.7) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43) — both positively associated with PSS.
- Objective physiological markers consistent with elevated arousal/chronic stress: higher resting HR / mesor (z ≈ +1.25) and blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ −0.99).
- Short and highly variable nocturnal sleep (median ≈ 6h32m, z ≈ −0.8; SD night-to-night z ≈ +1.49) and subjective poor sleep (PSQI = 6) — both linked to higher PSS.
- An unusually large early-morning HR elevation (8–9am deviation z ≈ +1.71) that could reflect heightened daily arousal.

Comparative considerations within each study frame
- Participant 1’s indicators that point upward are dominated by high-weight self-report predictors (very strong correlations with PSS: e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.80, emotional lability r = 0.67). Although wearable physiology largely points protective (robust amplitude, regularity, long objective sleep), the summary judges these protective signals insufficient to override the strong self-report signals; the explicit inference is “above the mean.”
- Participant 2 shows meaningful physiological and symptom indicators toward higher stress (depression, elevated RHR/mesor, blunted amplitude, variable/short sleep), but these are counterbalanced by several behavioral/contextual protective factors (low substance use, higher happiness/trust, good interdaily stability). The study summary therefore places Participant 2 near or modestly above their population mean (population mean 21.62), not clearly far above it.
- Strength of evidence: Participant 1’s upward signals involve measures with larger reported correlations with PSS, whereas Participant 2’s upward signals are moderate and more mixed with protective buffers.

Weighted conclusion
- On balance, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress relative to their study population than Participant 2 is relative to theirs. Participant 1’s strong self-report predictors (anxiety, emotional lability, subjective poor sleep, pain interference) provide a clearer, higher-weighted signal of elevated PSS than Participant 2’s mixed physiological/symptom profile, which the study judged to be near or only modestly above the mean.

- Clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). In this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), so poor perceived sleep quality is a plausible elevating factor.
- Pain/interference (PEG-3 ≈ 4.9; PAPAS ~50; both above median) which correlates with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47) and can increase perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = +1.54) that could reduce perceived social support and contribute to stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ +1.2 each), which may reflect higher basal autonomic arousal sometimes associated with stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 20, z = +0.7) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ +0.17); both correlate positively with PSS.
- Shorter and highly variable objective sleep (median ~6 h 32 m, z ≈ −0.8; night-to-night SD z ≈ +1.49) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6), sleep features linked to higher PSS.
- Elevated resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ +1.25), blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ −0.99), and a pronounced early-morning HR elevation (8–9am z ≈ +1.71) — physiological patterns often associated with greater chronic arousal or affective dysregulation and with higher PSS.
- Several of these indicators (depression/anxiety, sleep disturbance, elevated RHR/blunted amplitude) converge in the direction of higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Both descriptions position the participants near their respective study means, but in opposite directions: Participant 1 is characterized as near or slightly below their population mean PSS (protective factors outweigh risks), whereas Participant 2 is characterized as near or modestly above their population mean PSS.
- Strength of protective vs. risk signals: Participant 1 shows a strong protective factor (high self-efficacy, NGSE Z = +1.41) with a strong inverse correlation to PSS in that sample (r ≈ −0.63), robust circadian regularity, and low emotional lability — together these are emphasized as outweighing the participant’s sleep/pain/interpersonal risks. Participant 2 shows a cluster of symptom and physiological risk indicators (depression, sleep shortness/variability, elevated RHR/mesor, blunted amplitude, morning HR spike) that collectively point toward higher stress; protective behaviors are present but described as less dominant than the converging physiological/symptom signals.
- Population SD/context: Participant 1’s inference rests on large protective effects relative to their sample; Participant 2’s indicators cluster within ~1 SD above mean in a sample with a smaller SD (so those elevations are relatively more concentrated/meaningful).

Conclusion (which participant likely exhibits the higher PSS)
- Overall balance favors Participant 2 as the individual more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their respective population.

- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8.5 (well above clinical cutoff) and PSQI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 mean 8.33 and PAPAS Z = +1.21; pain measures positively correlate with PSS.  
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal: large overnight HR deviations (+13–14 bpm around midnight–2am) that are meaningfully correlated with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Sleep timing variability/fragmentation: high night‑to‑night sleep SD (199 min, Z ≈ +0.65), which can worsen subjective stress.

(Protective/muting factors noted: above‑average self‑efficacy, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR, low substance use—these temper but do not negate the above signals.)

- Elevated trait internalizing symptoms: STAI trait z ≈ +0.46 and CES‑D z ≈ +0.28 (both above the sample mean).  
- Low self‑esteem: RSES z ≈ −1.57 (notable negative), and lower happiness/health satisfaction (happiness z ≈ −0.53; health satisfaction z ≈ −1.45).  
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 6 (above clinical cutoff).  
- Low physical activity and sedentary behaviors: exercise frequency z ≈ −1.9, high internet use and sedentary hobby z’s ≈ +1.4–1.5.  
- Elevated baseline cardiac activation: MESOR z ≈ +1.77 and resting HR z ≈ +1.55, and resting HR correlates positively with PSS in the sample.

(Protective/muting factors noted: strong interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation, low intradaily variability, objectively long and consistent sleep duration, social time and strong GPA, and larger HR amplitude—these mitigate stress risk.)

Comparative reasoning in the within‑sample frame
- Each participant is judged relative to their own study’s population mean PSS. Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes “above the population mean,” driven by moderately strong clinical indicators (GAD‑7 at threshold, PSQI well above cutoff, high pain interference) plus nocturnal HR elevations that are directly correlated with PSS. Those signals are described as “strongest and most directly relevant predictors” in that dataset.  
- Participant 2’s profile is characterized as “near to slightly above the population mean.” Although P2 shows substantial objective physiological activation (MESOR, resting HR z’s large) and psychosocial risk factors (low self‑esteem, some elevated internalizing symptoms), many stress‑linked markers are only modestly elevated (STAI/CES‑D z’s ~ +0.3–+0.5) and several robust protective signals (very strong interdaily stability, long consistent objective sleep, high HR amplitude, social/academic supports) are present and emphasized in the summary.  
- Comparing magnitude and diagnostic relevance of signals: P1 has clinical‑level anxiety and stronger subjective sleep disturbance and pain interference, plus nocturnal HR deviations specifically tied to PSS. P2’s elevations are more mixed and of smaller effect sizes for psychological measures, and several high‑magnitude protective biomarkers offset their physiological activation. Thus, the balance of evidence indicates P1 shows a clearer, stronger pattern of elevated perceived stress relative to their sample mean than P2 does relative to theirs.

- Low self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ −1.57), which is linked to higher perceived stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, above clinical cut), despite objectively long sleep — subjective disturbance correlates with higher PSS.
- Very low exercise (exercise frequency z ≈ −1.9), and sedentary/leisure patterns (internet use z ≈ +1.52; sedentary hobby z ≈ +1.41) that are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated cardiovascular activation (MESOR z ≈ +1.77; resting HR z ≈ +1.55), which in the sample is positively correlated with PSS.
- Lower happiness and health satisfaction (happiness z ≈ −0.53; health satisfaction z ≈ −1.45) that align with greater perceived stress.
Overall synthesis in-frame: multiple psychosocial and physiological indicators push toward perceived stress slightly above the population mean (the original summary interprets “near to slightly above” the mean PSS = 21.62).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) with a moderately strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.46).
- Very short objective nightly sleep (median 3 h 27 min, z ≈ −0.66) and high night‑to‑night variability (SD z ≈ +0.62), plus increased napping (z ≈ +1.24) — sleep restriction and fragmentation are linked to greater stress.
- Very high intradaily variability (z ≈ +2.29), indicating fragmented rest–activity rhythms; this metric correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.24).
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal z ≈ +0.94), a potential psychosocial stressor.
However, these are counterbalanced by strong indicators of lower stress (below).

Comparative, within-frame reasoning:
- Participant 1’s profile was interpreted by the study team as “near to slightly above” their study mean PSS (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68) because several moderate predictors of higher stress (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, low self‑esteem, elevated resting HR, disturbed subjective sleep, low exercise) outweigh protective circadian/sleep regularity signals but not overwhelmingly so.
- Participant 2’s profile was interpreted as below their study mean PSS (mean = 21.42, SD = 7.28). Although Participant 2 shows severe objective and subjective sleep problems and high intradaily variability (strong risk factors for higher PSS), the strongest sample-level predictors (very low GAD‑7 anxiety, high self‑efficacy NGSE, very low emotional lability) that have large correlations with PSS point toward substantially lower perceived stress in this participant’s study frame.
- The magnitude and number of strong predictors favoring lower stress are greater for Participant 2 (GAD‑7 with r ≈ 0.76; NGSE with r ≈ −0.65; emotional lability very low) than the magnitude/consistency of high‑stress signals in Participant 1, which are more moderate and partially offset by strong circadian/sleep regularity.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 1 is characterized as near-to-slightly above their population mean PSS.
- Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean PSS.
Because the task is to determine which participant exhibits the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study populations, Participant 1 more likely has the higher PSS (i.e., worse perceived stress) than Participant 2.

24,89652,33,28,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong, high-impact subjective predictors:
  - Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18; Z = 1.51) — GAD-7 has a very high positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74), making this a dominant predictor of elevated PSS.
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5; Z = 1.65) — PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.43).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63).
  - Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS), which correlate positively with PSS.
  - Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; r = -0.66 with PSS), indicating reduced coping resources.
- Convergent subjective pattern: multiple subjective measures that each have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS point consistently toward above‑mean perceived stress.
- Some wearable features could exacerbate stress (late-evening HR deviations overlapping sleep opportunity), even though overall physiology shows resilience.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity metrics that are modestly associated with PSS:
  - Very late median sleep start (≈02:54), shorter median sleep duration (~6 h 34 m; Z = -0.76), and high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD z = 1.62).
  - Elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (Z = 1.30) and low 24‑h autocorrelation (Z = -0.87), indicating fragmented/unstable daily rhythms.
  - Slightly elevated mean daily naps (Z = 1.49).
- These wearable/sleep-timing features have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.13–0.15), so they provide modest evidence that this participant’s behavior could raise perceived stress or vulnerability.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is reported relative to its own population mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be above their study mean PSS (20.54); Participant 2 is inferred to be at/below their study mean PSS (21.6).
- Strength and quality of predictors differ: Participant 1’s subjective indicators (anxiety, PSQI, emotional lability, pain, low self‑efficacy) are both large in magnitude (positive Z scores) and strongly correlated with PSS (some r’s > 0.6), giving high confidence that their PSS is meaningfully above their cohort mean.
- Participant 2’s subjective profile strongly favors lower perceived stress (low depression/anxiety, high wellbeing, good PSQI), while the features that push toward higher PSS are objective rhythm/sleep‑timing irregularities whose correlations with PSS are small. Thus the evidence that Participant 2’s PSS is elevated is weak and modest in effect size.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1 shows multiple, large subjective risk signals that are strongly predictive of higher PSS in their sample; objective physiology provides some resilience but does not outweigh the strong subjective signal.
- Participant 2 shows robust subjective signals of low distress and wellbeing consistent with below‑mean PSS; objective irregularities are present but only weakly associated with PSS.
- Therefore, Participant 1 is much more likely to have the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 2.

25,89652,21,28,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: very late median sleep start (02:54), modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m, z = -0.76), high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 172 min, z = 1.62). These features are associated with greater perceived stress in the sample (sleep variability r ≈ 0.13).
- Fragmented daily physiological rhythms: elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (z = 1.30) and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (z = -0.87), which modestly correlate with PSS (intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15).
- Slightly elevated daytime napping (z = 1.49), consistent with compensatory sleep and possible stress-related daytime fatigue.

Notes on strength: these are objective signals with small-to-modest correlations with PSS in this study. They provide modest evidence toward higher perceived stress but are counterbalanced by strong subjective wellbeing indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated anxiety and very strong predictive weight: GAD-7 = 6 (mild anxiety) and GAD‑7 correlates strongly with PSS in the sample (r = 0.78). This is a highly salient contributor to elevated PSS.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep), with a moderate correlation with PSS (r = 0.49).
- Pain and activity interference: PEG‑3 mean 6.78 and PAPAS z = 0.24; both correlate moderately with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Pronounced circadian/sleep irregularity: very high sleep duration variability (SD = 273 min, z = 1.7), low interdaily stability (z = -0.68), and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.35) — objective patterns typically associated with higher perceived stress.
- Some interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.54 (adds to stress burden).

Protective factors that temper these risks: above‑average self‑efficacy (z = 0.3, r with PSS = -0.65), no substance problems (z = -1.62), normative resting HR. Still, multiple high‑weight predictors (anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, pain interference, circadian irregularity) point toward PSS above that study mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is described as likely below (or at) their study mean PSS (population mean 21.6). The strongest evidence is consistent, high‑weight subjective indicators of low distress (low CES‑D, low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, good PSQI), which outweigh the objective circadian/sleep irregularities whose correlations with PSS are small.
- Participant 2 is described as likely modestly above their study mean PSS (population mean 21.04). Several measures that have relatively large correlations with PSS in that sample — notably GAD‑7 and PSQI — are elevated, and objective sleep/circadian irregularity is pronounced.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Strength and number of risk indicators: Participant 2 presents multiple, moderately-to-strongly predictive risk factors for higher PSS (especially anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance, which have the largest correlations with PSS). Participant 1 mainly shows one class of risk (circadian/sleep timing irregularity) with only small correlations to PSS.
- Protective vs risk weighting: Participant 1’s strong subjective wellbeing measures provide substantial protective weight relative to their population; Participant 2’s protective factors (self‑efficacy, no substance problems) are meaningful but do not fully counterbalance the high‑weight risk signals.
- Relative extremity of objective sleep variability: both show elevated sleep variability, but Participant 2’s is more extreme (SD 273 min vs 172 min) and accompanies subjective poor sleep, increasing its relevance to PSS.

Conclusion
Given the stronger, more numerous, and higher‑weight predictors of perceived stress in Participant 2 (particularly anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance with high correlations to PSS), Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS score compared with Participant 1.

- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; Z ≈ 0.59) — PSQI correlates positively with PSS in the sample.
- Late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start 01:21; sleep-duration SD = 144 min, Z ≈ 0.98; sleep start SD Z ≈ 0.33) — greater timing/regularity disruption maps to higher PSS.
- Wearable circadian markers indicating less stable rhythms (elevated intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.17; reduced 24-hour autocorrelation Z ≈ −0.70) — these metrics show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS.
- Evening/night heart-rate elevations (e.g., 12–1am deviation Z = 1.72) consistent with nocturnal arousal, which is associated with higher perceived stress.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12; Z ≈ 0.46) — GAD-7 here has a very strong correlation with PSS (≈ 0.77), making this a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; Z ≈ 1.32) — PSQI also correlates positively with PSS (≈ 0.45).
- Marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations (e.g., 12–1am +11.92 bpm, Z ≈ 1.02) that correlate with PSS (≈ 0.22–0.39), indicating autonomic arousal at night.
- Reduced self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) combined with a strong negative correlation with PSS (≈ −0.66) — lower coping/self-efficacy supports higher perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24) which strongly tracks with PSS (correlation ≈ 0.68).

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study population mean PSS (P1 mean 21.61; P2 mean 20.67). Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes their overall profile is most consistent with PSS near their population mean (mixed but balanced: strong psychological resilience vs. sleep/circadian risk factors). Participant 2’s summary explicitly concludes their pattern is consistent with PSS above their population mean, driven by multiple strong predictors.
- The strength and number of high-impact predictors differ: Participant 2 shows multiple large, high-correlation signals (clinically meaningful anxiety with very high PSS correlation, very poor PSQI, large nocturnal HR deviations, lower self-efficacy), whereas Participant 1’s stress-elevating signals are mainly sleep/circadian-related with smaller effect sizes and are counterbalanced by strong protective psychological/functioning indicators (low depression, low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness/trust, strong academic performance).
- Given the relative magnitudes and the reported correlations with PSS in each sample, Participant 2’s risk indicators (particularly GAD-7 and PSQI) are stronger and more directly predictive of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1’s sleep/circadian deviations are predictive of elevated stress.

Weighted judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit higher perceived stress (above their sample mean) than Participant 1 (near their sample mean). Participant 2’s several high-impact, high-correlation indicators outweigh Participant 1’s more modest objective sleep/circadian disturbances, especially since Participant 1 has multiple strong psychological resilience factors.

1,59673,17,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 1’s study population):
- Sleep/circadian disruption: PSQI = 8 (disturbed sleep), late median sleep onset (01:21), high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 144 min) and timing—these features are positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Wearable circadian indices: modestly elevated intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (less stable rhythms), which have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS.
- Evening/night heart-rate elevations (notable Z-scores ~1.4–1.7) that may reflect late-night physiological arousal linked to stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Severe sleep problems: PSQI = 11.5 (highly disturbed); objectively very short median sleep (~3.5 hours) and very late median sleep onset (~03:37 AM). Short/disturbed sleep has a relatively strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.48).
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33 and PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43, with pain measures showing moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: clear late-night/early-morning heart-rate elevations (Z up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian amplitude/autocorrelation—these wearable signals are moderately associated with higher PSS.
- Convergence of multiple strong risk signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) that the summary explicitly judges to outweigh protective factors.

Comparative reasoning within each population’s frame:
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are protective trait/function measures (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, strong academics). Although they have sleep/circadian disruptions and some nocturnal HR elevation, the summary concludes the overall profile is most consistent with PSS near the population mean (21.61).
- Participant 2 shows multiple large abnormalities that, in this sample, have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (subjective and objective extreme sleep disruption, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevation). While Participant 2 has important protective signals (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability), the summary explicitly states these do not fully counterbalance the prominent risk signals and concludes PSS is likely above the population mean (21.21).

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 1: mixed profile but overall judged near mean; protective trait measures are strong and reduce the likelihood of a high PSS relative to their cohort.
- Participant 2: multiple large, concordant risk indicators with stronger sample-level correlations to PSS (notably extreme short sleep, high PSQI, pain, nocturnal arousal); the study summary explicitly concludes above-mean perceived stress.

13,88008,28,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: Trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.66) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ +0.70) are above the population mean and are positively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), supporting higher perceived stress.  
- Lower self‑esteem and lower self‑reported happiness/health satisfaction (modestly below mean) which are associated with greater stress appraisal.  
- Short objectively measured sleep (median ≈ 6 h 9 min, Z ≈ −1.29) could increase stress vulnerability and impair emotion regulation.  
- Although many physiological/behavioral indices are protective, the combination of psychological elevations and short sleep provides plausible pathways to above‑mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self‑report signals that are tightly linked to PSS in this dataset: mild anxiety (GAD‑7), emotional lability (BASIS‑24), and poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9). These measures have large correlations with PSS (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80; emotional lability r ≈ 0.67; PSQI r ≈ 0.59), making them especially predictive of higher stress.  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG, PAPAS) are elevated and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50), adding another independent source of perceived burden.  
- Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations that align with higher PSS (several late‑night hourly deviations with r ≈ 0.40–0.45) suggest physiological arousal during sleep that maps onto higher stress.  
- Although objective circadian regularity and long sleep opportunity are protective, these features are described as moderating rather than outweighing the strong survey-based predictors.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are described as leaning above their respective population means, but the strength and predictive weight of the elevated indicators differ. Participant 1’s elevated measures (STAI, CES‑D) are only modestly correlated with PSS in that study (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and multiple strong wearable‑based buffers (high circadian amplitude, high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, frequent exercise, low substance use) plausibly attenuate perceived stress. The net inference for P1 was “near to modestly above” the population mean.  
- Participant 2’s elevated measures (GAD‑7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain) have substantially larger correlations with PSS (many r ≥ 0.47 and some r ≈ 0.80), which implies each increment in those scales is much more predictive of higher PSS in that study. The description explicitly indicates these self‑report measures carry high predictive weight and that wearable protective factors likely moderate but do not overturn the inference of above‑mean PSS.  
- Given that predictive effect sizes (correlations with PSS) for Participant 2’s elevated domains are notably larger than those for Participant 1, the balance of evidence within each study suggests Participant 2 is more strongly shifted upward relative to peers than Participant 1 is.

Weighted judgment
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple, strongly PSS‑related self‑report elevations (anxiety, emotional lability, poor subjective sleep, pain) with high correlations to PSS in that dataset, whereas Participant 1’s psychosocial elevations are more modest and are counterbalanced by stronger objective/behavioral buffers. Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5) and a strong sample-level correlation between PSQI and PSS (r ≈ 0.53), which links this indicator directly to higher perceived stress.
- Very short median wearable sleep (≈4 h 22 min) and very large night-to-night sleep duration and timing variability (SDs and z-scores reported), both of which are known to aggravate stress and emotion regulation.
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude), consistent with irregular daily structure that commonly co-occurs with elevated perceived stress.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 interpersonal z ≈ +2.34), a pronounced psychosocial strain that—despite a weak sample-level correlation with PSS—constitutes a salient contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress.
- Several convergent behavioral/physiological indicators point toward disrupted sleep–wake organization, which in this dataset have credible links to higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Moderate elevations in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI and CES‑D z ≈ +0.66–0.70) that have modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), supporting higher stress appraisal.
- Lower self‑esteem and modestly lower reported happiness/health satisfaction, which also trend with higher perceived stress.
- Shorter-than-average total sleep time (median ≈ 6 h 9 min, z ≈ -1.29), which can increase vulnerability to stress even when subjective sleep quality appears acceptable.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s indications of stress are dominated by very severe objective and subjective sleep disruption and circadian irregularity, plus a very large interpersonal-problems score (z ≈ +2.34). The PSQI–PSS correlation in this sample is fairly strong (r ≈ 0.53), strengthening the inference that the participant’s sleep disturbance plausibly maps onto higher perceived stress. Protective signals (very low current anxiety, low pain, near‑average self‑efficacy, lower resting HR) are present but do not directly counter the magnitude and breadth of sleep/circadian/interpersonal burdens.
- Participant 2’s indications of stress are primarily psychological (moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms) but of relatively smaller magnitude (z ≈ +0.66–0.70) and with only moderate correlations to PSS. Critically, Participant 2 shows multiple robust protective factors—strong, regular circadian rhythms (amplitude and interdaily stability z-scores large and positive; intradaily variability strongly negative), frequent exercise, low substance use—that are associated in the sample with lower PSS and likely attenuate the impact of the internalizing symptoms. The sleep issue for Participant 2 is shorter but regular sleep (consistent but truncated), a weaker direct predictor of PSS in this sample than the severe sleep disruption seen in Participant 1.

Overall balance of evidence
- Both participants are described as near-to-modestly-above their respective study means. However, the weight and severity of predictors differ: Participant 1 has more extreme and convergent objective + subjective sleep pathology and a very large interpersonal-problems score—factors that (in this dataset) have strong or meaningful links to PSS—while Participant 2 has only moderate internalizing symptoms but multiple strong behavioral and circadian buffers.
- Therefore, on balance (working within each study’s frame and available correlations), Participant 1’s profile indicates a higher likelihood of elevated perceived stress relative to their population mean than Participant 2’s profile does relative to theirs.

19,97448,28,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Marked subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0; ""disturbed sleep"") and median nightly sleep = 2 h 38 m (Z = -0.94) with extreme sleep-onset variability (SD Z = +1.3). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.47).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (1–2 AM +13.54 bpm, Z = +1.17; 3–4 AM +9.79 bpm, Z = +1.59) and circadian irregularity—features that in this sample associate positively with PSS (overnight HR r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate); trait anxiety showed the strongest sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), so this is a powerful driver toward higher perceived stress.
- Additional contributors: some pain-related interference (PAPAS = 65; r with PSS = 0.48) and fragmented circadian metrics (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability) that commonly associate with higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep complaint: PSQI = 6 crosses the typical threshold for ""disturbed sleep"" (though Z ≈ -0.33), which can elevate perceived stress in some contexts.
- Late habitual sleep timing: median sleep onset ≈ 01:44 (eveningness) which can be associated with stressors or psychosocial strain.
- Elevated evening/late-afternoon physiological activation: wearable hourly HR deviations show pronounced positive deviations in afternoon/evening (Z up to ≈ +2.2), suggesting situational physiological arousal that could increase perceived stress.
- Modest behavioral risk: alcohol use slightly above average (1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1.0) and somewhat lower self-reported happiness (Z ≈ -0.53).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be above their population mean PSS (mean = 20.75); Participant 2 is inferred to be near-to-slightly-below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.62).
- Strength and direction of key correlates: Participant 1 displays multiple strong, convergent risk signals that in this sample relate fairly strongly to PSS—especially moderate GAD-7 (very high r with PSS = 0.78) and extreme sleep deprivation/irregularity (PSQI r = 0.47; overnight HR r ≈ 0.32–0.38). These signals are large in magnitude and coherent with a higher-than-average perceived stress inference.
- Participant 2 shows several robust protective signals that in this sample associate with lower PSS: very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES‑D and STAI substantially below mean), low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.87), strong interdaily stability and high amplitude of circadian rhythm (Z ≈ +1.0 to +1.29), and regular exercise. The risk signals for Participant 2 (PSQI just over threshold, late sleep timing, evening HR elevations) are weaker, situational, or partly offset by coherent rhythm and low affective symptoms.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s high-impact risk indicators (moderate anxiety with high PSS correlation; extreme sleep loss and nocturnal physiological arousal) outweigh their protective traits. Participant 2’s risk indicators are milder and more isolated, while several strong protective indicators point toward near/below-mean stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (crosses common clinical threshold for disturbed sleep), which can relate to higher perceived stress.
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:44): eveningness or late timing can reflect or contribute to situational stressors.
- Elevated evening heart‑rate deviations (notably mid‑afternoon and 8–10 PM; Zs up to ~2.2): suggests episodic physiological arousal in the later day that could elevate perceived stress situationally.
- Slightly higher-than-average alcohol use (1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) and somewhat lower current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53): modest behavioral/affective signals that can co-occur with elevated stress.
Note on strength: these risk signals are generally modest or situational in the description and are outweighed by multiple stronger protective indicators (low depression/anxiety scores, low resting HR, strong circadian stability).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame)

- High pain/functional impairment: PAPAS = 81 (Z ≈ 0.93), with PAPAS also positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self‑efficacy: NGSE Z = -0.62; NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so this is a substantive risk factor.
- Elevated cardiac markers associated with stress: higher mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and notable nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–3 AM values with Zs up to ~1.38); night‑time HR deviations in this sample are positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83) and late acrophase: circadian irregularity aligns with higher PSS in the sample.
Note on strength: several of these indicators are described as among the strongest, and some have medium–large correlations with PSS in this dataset. Mitigating signals (mild GAD-7, long median sleep duration, low intradaily variability) are present but are smaller/less central than the risk signals.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Participant 1 is characterized overall as near to modestly below their population mean PSS. The strongest signals in their profile are protective (large negative Zs on depression/anxiety, high circadian stability, low resting HR), while the risk signals (PSQI, late sleep onset, evening HR elevations) are weaker or situational. Many of the protective measures also have only modest correlations with PSS in the sample, but they are coherent and more numerous than the risks.
- Participant 2 is characterized overall as above their population mean PSS. Multiple, relatively strong signals that are known in this sample to correlate with higher PSS converge (disturbed PSQI, high PAPAS, low NGSE, nocturnal HR elevations, reduced interdaily stability). Some of these predictors (NGSE, PSQI, PAPAS, GAD correlations) show medium–large sample correlations with PSS, making them more diagnostically informative here. Although Participant 2 has a few protective/mitigating features, the primary and more strongly correlated indicators point toward elevated perceived stress.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The evidence for elevated perceived stress is stronger and more internally consistent for Participant 2: several risk indicators with moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS converge (sleep disturbance, pain, low self‑efficacy, nocturnal HR increases, circadian irregularity).
- Participant 1’s risk signals are fewer and generally weaker than their protective signals; the summary explicitly concludes P1 is likely near or modestly below their population mean PSS.

  - Limited substance use, social/exercise engagement, steady academic performance (all protective).
- Overall assessment in the description: judged above the population mean but the elevation is described as modest-to-moderate (population mean PSS = 21.64).

- Weight of predictor strength: Participant 1’s elevated measures include several variables that, in their dataset, have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (anxiety r ≈ 0.77, emotional lability r ≈ 0.67, self-efficacy r ≈ −0.66, PSQI r ≈ 0.49). Those strong correlates collectively create a high-probability signal of being above that study’s mean.
- Participant 2’s above-mean indicators include some sizable single metrics (PSQI z ≈ +1.05; internet use z ≈ +2.19) and modestly elevated physiology, but several protective signals (low depression, good interdaily stability) and generally more mixed evidence. In addition, several circadian and physiological measures in Participant 2 have limited direct correlations with PSS in that sample, making their predictive weight lower.
- Magnitude and consistency: Participant 1 shows multiple converging, moderately-to-strongly weighted risk indicators for elevated perceived stress. Participant 2 shows a more mixed profile with one or two strong behavioral flags (internet use, PSQI) but also multiple protective signs that likely blunt overall PSS elevation.

- Very high anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51). In this dataset anxiety is a very strong predictor of PSS (r ≈ 0.75), so this is a major contributor.  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ 0.83) plus objectively late sleep onset (median ~01:42) and very short median sleep duration (~4 h 55 min), all of which tend to raise perceived stress.  
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) which reduces coping capacity and correlates positively with PSS.  
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73), a strong negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ −0.61).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive late‑night HR deviations (several hourly HR deviation Zs up to ~2.8) that correlate positively with PSS, indicating hyperarousal that would plausibly increase perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their cohort)
- Extremely elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ 3.4) and very high trait anxiety (STAI‑T Z ≈ 3.13). Although the CES‑D/STAI→PSS correlations are smaller per unit (r ≈ 0.28–0.31) than GAD→PSS in Study 1, the magnitudes here are very large relative to the cohort and are powerful indicators of elevated perceived stress.  
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ 1.52) combined with very late and highly variable sleep timing (median start ~02:41, SD ≈ 84 min), both associated with higher stress.  
- Behavioral/lifestyle markers tied to stress: very high passive screen time (TV Z ≈ 3.17, Internet Z ≈ 2.19), very low exercise, and elevated napping (naps/day Z ≈ 2.4).  
- Physiologic indicators of elevated tone: above‑average resting HR and elevated mesor (RHR Z ≈ 1.22; mesor Z ≈ 0.85), consistent with higher tonic cardiovascular load.  
- Low self‑esteem and low health satisfaction (RSES Z ≈ −2.42; health sat Z ≈ −2.28), psychosocial factors that correlate with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both descriptions explicitly place each participant above their study population mean for perceived stress. The question is which participant is more extreme relative to their own cohort given the pattern and magnitude of convergent indicators.  
- Participant 1’s strongest single predictor is anxiety, and in Study 1 anxiety has a very large correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.75). Participant 1 also shows multiple other above‑mean stress contributors (pain, very short sleep, low self‑efficacy) and pronounced nocturnal HR arousal. However, Participant 1 also shows notable protective signals (above‑average circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, low intradaily fragmentation, resting HR near mean, low substance use), which likely attenuate the net stress burden to some degree.  
- Participant 2 shows extreme, multi-domain departures from cohort norms: very large Zs for depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both >3), large behavioral risk patterns (high passive media use, low exercise, high napping), elevated resting HR/mesor, and markedly low self‑esteem/health satisfaction. Some protective signs exist (adequate median sleep duration, preserved interdaily stability and nocturnal HR dipping, low substance use), but the magnitude and number of severe psychosocial and behavioral deviations in Participant 2 are substantial.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: concentrated and coherent high‑stress signal anchored by a very strong anxiety→PSS relationship and signs of physiological nocturnal arousal and very short sleep; but partially offset by preserved circadian regularity and limited substance use.  
- Participant 2: very large, multi‑domain elevations (depression, trait anxiety, extreme sedentary/passive behavior, low self‑esteem) with supporting physiologic and behavioral markers; several of these deviations are extreme relative to their cohort (Zs > 2–3) and widespread across mood, behavior, and lifestyle domains. Although the per‑unit correlations of some Participant 2 measures with PSS are smaller than GAD→PSS in Study 1, the sheer magnitude and breadth of Participant 2’s deviations make a strong case for a higher net perceived stress relative to their cohort.

Conclusion
Taking into account within‑cohort frames, predictor‑to‑PSS correlations, the magnitude (Z) and breadth of deviations, and protective vs. risk features, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

17,66047,19,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population)
- Severe state anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = 1.25) — in this study GAD is very strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.81), so this is a high‑weight indicator of above‑average perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.51), reinforcing the stress inference.
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62; NGSE r with PSS = -0.66) and moderate pain/interference — psychosocial and somatic factors that tend to elevate perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (RHR Z ≈ 1.5; mesor Z ≈ 1.49) — physiological arousal consistent with sustained stress in this sample.
- Short/late/irregular recorded sleep timing (median wearable sleep short, late median sleep start, sleep‑start SD Z ≈ 0.98) that is behaviorally concordant with the subjective sleep disturbance and stress.
- Emotional/functional disturbance on BASIS‑24 subscales (small elevations) supporting psychosocial strain.

Mitigating notes (within this sample frame): some preserved circadian regularity and a recognizable diurnal HR pattern provide modest protective/organizing signals, and the wearable sleep duration may be undercounted (measurement caveat).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Extremely high depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 46; Z = 3.4) and very high trait anxiety (STAI‑T = 73; Z = 3.13). Although the correlations with PSS in this dataset are moderate (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), these are very large deviations above the sample mean and strongly point to substantially elevated stress relative to this population.
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ 1.52) plus very late and variable sleep timing — both associated with greater perceived stress.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ -2.42) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.28) — psychosocial vulnerabilities that correlate with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate and reduced HR amplitude (mesor Z ≈ 0.85; amplitude Z ≈ -0.31) and modestly elevated intradaily variability — physiological signs compatible with sustained load.
- Lifestyle/behavioral markers linked to stress: high daytime napping (naps/day Z ≈ 2.4), very low exercise, and very high passive screen time (TV Z = 3.17; Internet Z = 2.19).

Mitigating notes (within this sample frame): median sleep duration is adequate (7h15m; Z ≈ 0.08) and there is some interdaily stability and clear nocturnal HR dipping, plus low substance use and modest social contact — these partially buffer but do not erase the large psychiatric symptom burden.

Comparative interpretation within each participant’s population frame
- Participant 1 shows several convergent high‑weight indicators of stress in this sample, most notably very severe state anxiety (GAD) and poor subjective sleep, plus elevated physiological arousal (RHR/mesor). Those features are strongly linked to PSS in Participant 1’s study (especially the very high GAD‑PSS correlation), supporting an above‑mean PSS for this participant.
- Participant 2 shows a broader and more extreme pattern of psychopathology relative to their sample: depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are far above the population mean (Z > 3), self‑esteem and health satisfaction are far below the mean (Z ≈ -2.4), and multiple behavioral and physiologic markers also point toward elevated stress. Even though some correlations with PSS are more modest in this dataset, the magnitude of these deviations (multiple Zs > 2–3) suggests a substantial elevation in perceived stress relative to Participant 2’s population.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population PSS means. Participant 1 has very salient stress indicators (especially severe GAD and poor sleep) that are highly predictive of PSS in that study.
- Participant 2, however, displays more extreme and multidomain elevation relative to their population: very large Z‑scores for depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, markedly low self‑esteem, pronounced sedentary/passive behavior and increased napping, plus physiologic signs. The magnitude and breadth of these deviations (several Zs > 2–3 across mood, trait anxiety, self‑concept, and behavior) provide stronger evidence that Participant 2’s perceived stress is further above their study mean than Participant 1’s is above theirs.

Conclusion
On balance — accounting for the within‑sample scaling and the relative extremeness of features in each participant’s description — Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

5,59207,14,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.33)
- Very large, convergent sleep-related signals linked to higher PSS: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), objectively extremely short median sleep (~3 h/night), and very large night-to-night timing variability (sleep start SD Z = 2.82). These sleep measures are strongly correlated with PSS in the sample and are among the clearest drivers of an elevated stress inference.
- Elevated anxiety-related and affective measures that have strong positive correlations with PSS: GAD-7 = 9 (r ≈ 0.78 with PSS in the sample) and elevated BASIS-24 emotional lability (r ≈ 0.68). These amplify the stress signal from poor sleep.
- Substance-related problems and pain interference (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75; pain measures correlate with PSS) — additional risk factors tied to higher perceived stress in this sample.
- Circadian/physiological instability (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, etc.) that in this dataset is associated with greater stress and poorer sleep.
- Protective factors (very high self-efficacy Z = 1.79; low resting HR) are present but, per the summary, do not fully offset the multiple strong PSS-correlated signals above. Overall the interpretation explicitly concluded “above the population mean.”

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.62)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) and late, variable sleep timing (sleep start median ≈ 01:35 AM and sleep timing/duration SDs Z ≈ 1.27–1.55). Subjective poor sleep and timing variability correlate positively with PSS and could push perceived stress upward.
- Modestly lower momentary happiness and slightly elevated resting heart rate (61.4 bpm, Z ≈ 0.39) and small early-morning HR deviations — weak physiological hints of strain.
- However, many of these risk signs are modest in magnitude and are counterbalanced by several relatively strong protective signals (see below). The provided inference explicitly judged the participant near the population mean, leaning modestly below it.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1’s risk signals are large in magnitude, multi-domain (subjective + objective sleep, anxiety, substance problems, circadian instability), and include several measures that the summary notes have particularly strong correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78, emotional lability r ≈ 0.68, PSQI r ≈ 0.50). The integrated conclusion for P1 was clearly “above the population mean.”
- Participant 2 presents a mixed profile but with substantial protective factors relative to their population (strong interdaily stability, high amplitude, low intradaily variability, long median sleep ≈ 8h13, low depression/trait anxiety, good self-esteem, regular exercise). The summary explicitly concludes P2 is near the population mean with a tendency slightly below it.
- Given that each description is already interpreted relative to its own population mean, the within-frame inferences favor Participant 1 being above their mean and Participant 2 being at/just below theirs. The strength, number, and correlation-weighted importance of P1’s risk indicators outweigh P2’s modest risk signals.

Overall judgment
Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their population).

16,88882,23,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Sleep insufficiency and poor subjective sleep: median nightly sleep ≈5h57m (Z = -1.53) and PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), both commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Marked delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ≈02:34) and circadian irregularity: lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability, and low 24-h autocorrelation—patterns modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Evening heart-rate deviations (elevated 7–9 pm HR) that could reflect later-day physiological arousal linked to stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 12 (clearly disturbed) and PSQI has a fairly strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.50).
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53), which has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.65).
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone and nocturnal physiological arousal: resting HR = 78.21 bpm (z = 1.37), mesor elevated (z = 1.18), and marked nocturnal HR elevations (1–4 AM) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Very large and unstable sleep quantity (median ≈12 h, z = 2.26; night-to-night SD z = 2.38), indicating major sleep instability/dysregulation that often co-occurs with stress-related dysregulation.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s stress-related signals are dominated by sleep/circadian disruption, but multiple strong protective signals counterbalance those risks: very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, low resting HR (Z = -1.28), frequent exercise, low substance use, and high academic performance. The description explicitly infers an overall PSS near or modestly below the study mean (mean = 21.62).
- Participant 2 shows several signals that are both domain-specific and directly correlated with higher PSS in this dataset: high PSQI, high emotional lability (strong correlation with PSS), elevated resting HR and mesor, and nocturnal HR elevations (moderate correlations with PSS). Although Participant 2 also has protective factors (low pain burden, good interpersonal function, low substance problems, only mild anxiety), the presence of multiple markers that have stronger empirical associations with PSS in this sample weighs toward a higher perceived-stress signal. The description infers PSS near the sample mean (mean = 20.96) but notes meaningful signs that could elevate perceived stress in specific domains.

Overall balance and determination
- Participant 1: mixed profile but leans toward near/ modestly below population mean PSS because strong psychometric and lifestyle protective factors counter the sleep/circadian risks.
- Participant 2: mixed profile but with several domain signals (particularly emotional lability, subjective sleep disturbance, elevated resting/nocturnal HR) that are more directly and strongly associated with higher PSS in this dataset; overall inference is near the mean but with a clearer tilt toward elevated domain-specific stress.

22,88882,10,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (population mean 21.5)
- Substantially elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83). PSQI correlates moderately-strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a meaningful upward predictor.
- Wearable sleep metrics consistent with severe nocturnal disruption (median sleep 1h44m, Z = -1.24; highly variable sleep start times), which aligns with the PSQI and supports real sleep-related stressors.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 avg 7.78 Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.8), both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations consistent with night arousal (midnight–early morning positive deviations), which modestly correlate with higher PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (population mean 21.62)
- Objectively short sleep (median ~5 h 57 m; Z = -1.53) and PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), both associated with higher PSS.
- Markedly delayed sleep timing (median start ~02:34) and circadian irregularity (reduced interdaily stability, low 24-hr autocorrelation, elevated intradaily variability), which modestly correlate with higher PSS.
- Evening/hourly HR elevations that could reflect later-day arousal linked to delayed sleep.

Comparative, population-relative reasoning
- Both profiles show a mix of risk (sleep/circadian disruption) and protective (low anxiety/depression, fitness, self-efficacy) signals. Crucially, each summary is written relative to its own study mean:
  - Participant 1’s integrated inference explicitly states perceived stress is “near the study population mean” but likely modestly above the mean because of elevated PSQI and pain/interference. Several elevated measures (PSQI, pain) have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample.
  - Participant 2’s integrated inference explicitly states perceived stress is “near the mean, perhaps slightly below it,” because very low trait anxiety/depression, high happiness/self-esteem, and strong exercise/fitness signals outweigh sleep/circadian risk factors in that sample.
- Magnitude and quality of protective vs. risk signals differ: Participant 1’s strongest risk signals (PSQI and pain) are framed as substantive contributors to an upward shift, whereas Participant 2’s strongest protective signals (STAI and CES-D strongly below mean, plus fitness/exercise) are described as outweighing sleep/circadian risks.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Given both within-population framings and the stated integrated inferences, Participant 1 is inferred to be modestly above their population mean PSS, while Participant 2 is inferred to be at or modestly below their population mean PSS.
- Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

11,83748,24,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (exceeds common cutoff), indicating subjective sleep problems that can raise perceived stress.
- Wearable circadian irregularity: reduced interdaily stability (0.37, Z ≈ −0.33), low 24-h autocorrelation (0.22, Z ≈ −0.87), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.10) — patterns linked to stress-related rhythm disruption.
- Evening/late-night physiological activation: pronounced evening HR peaks (5–7 pm: +22 to +28 bpm; Z up to +2.67) and a large late-night elevation (~11–12am +26.98, Z = +3.51) that may reflect episodic arousal associated with higher stress.
- Low socializing time (≈15 minutes/day; Z = −2.20), a behavioral vulnerability that can contribute to elevated perceived stress (though correlation with PSS in this sample is small).

Notes: these signals are present but moderate in predictive strength for PSS in this dataset and contrast with several strong protective indicators (very low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness, frequent exercise, low substance use). The summary explicitly infers Participant 1’s PSS as below the population mean (21.62).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report indicators tightly linked to PSS: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16; z ≈ +1.16; r with PSS ≈ 0.78), very high PSQI (15; z ≈ +0.5; r ≈ 0.49), elevated pain interference (PEG-3 z ≈ +1.18) and emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z ≈ +1.23; r with PSS ≈ 0.65).
- Low perceived coping resources: NGSE = 22 (z ≈ −1.55), a strong negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ −0.66), indicating less self-efficacy and higher vulnerability to stress.
- Severe sleep/circadian disruption corroborated by wearables: median sleep ≈ 2 h 58 m (z ≈ −0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), reduced amplitude (z ≈ −1.4), low interdaily stability and very low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ −1.4), and high intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.3) — a constellation strongly associated with elevated perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: nocturnal HR elevations (e.g., 1–2am deviation z ≈ +1.18) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40), providing physiologic corroboration of subjective distress.

Moderating notes: some daytime HR indices are below mean (resting HR and MESOR slightly low) and there are periods of lower daytime HR; however these do not negate the strong convergence of highly PSS-related self-report measures and nocturnal wearable markers. The summary explicitly infers Participant 2’s PSS as above the population mean (20.92).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study’s mean PSS. Participant 1’s strongest signals are protective (low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness, healthy behaviors) and the summary conclusion is PSS below that study’s mean (21.62), despite some wearable signs of circadian/arousal disturbance of modest predictive strength.
- Participant 2 shows multiple high-impact indicators that are strongly correlated with PSS in that study (severe anxiety, very poor sleep, low self‑efficacy, nocturnal HR elevations, marked circadian disruption) and the summary concludes PSS above that study’s mean (20.92).
- The self-report measures for Participant 2 (notably GAD‑7 and NGSE) have much larger sample correlations with PSS than the wearable features that weakly suggested higher PSS for Participant 1. The magnitude, number, and convergence of high-PSS predictors are greater for Participant 2.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 has multiple convergent, strongly PSS‑related indicators (both subjective and physiological) pointing to elevated perceived stress relative to their population.
- Participant 1 has a few physiological/behavioral risk signals but overall a predominance of protective, low‑stress indicators and is explicitly inferred to be below their population mean.

9,83748,12,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Wearable/circadian signals of evening/late‑night physiological arousal: large HR elevations in the evening and around midnight (hourly Zs up to +3.51) that are plausibly stress‑related.  
- Objective indices of circadian irregularity: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.33), low 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.10) — patterns that, in the sample, have small positive associations with PSS.  
- Subjective sleep difficulty (PSQI = 6), exceeding the common cutoff for disturbed sleep.  
- Very low socializing time (Z = −2.20), a behavioral vulnerability that can contribute to higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Marked subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (disturbed sleep; r with PSS ≈ 0.46), median nightly sleep ≈ 3.5 hours (Z = −0.66), high sleep‑duration variability (Z = +0.62), and increased napping (Z = +1.24) — a strong cluster associated with higher PSS in the sample.  
- High intradaily variability (Z = +2.29; r with PSS ≈ 0.24), indicating fragmented rest‑activity rhythms linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS‑24 interpersonal Z = +0.94), which could contribute to psychosocial stress (even if its sample correlation with PSS is small).

Comparative, within‑population considerations
- Magnitude and predictive strength: Participant 1’s strongest indicators are psychological well‑being measures that have known inverse relations with PSS (very low trait anxiety STAI‑T Z = −1.71; high self‑esteem Z = +1.52; momentary happiness Z = +1.64). These are large, consistent protective signals. By contrast, Participant 2’s strongest protective indicators (low GAD‑7 Z = −0.94 and higher NGSE Z = +0.49) are helpful but smaller in magnitude than Participant 1’s protective signals.  
- Adverse signals: Participant 2’s adverse signals (very short objective sleep, PSQI = 10, very high intradaily variability) are stronger and more directly linked to PSS in the sample than Participant 1’s adverse signals (moderate circadian irregularity and episodic evening HR peaks). PSQI and sleep duration in Participant 2 have moderate associations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.46), whereas Participant 1’s evening HR elevations have only small sample correlations with PSS (~0.2) and contrast with strong subjective well‑being.  
- Net balance: Participant 1’s profile is dominated by multiple, large protective psychosocial indicators that outweigh the wearable/circadian risk signals. Participant 2’s profile is mixed but the severity of sleep disturbance and circadian fragmentation is a comparatively stronger adverse cluster and likely offsets the moderate protective signals.

Conclusion
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to Participant 1.

23,34467,17,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically elevated) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48), so this is a credible risk signal.
- Very short objective sleep: median nightly duration ≈ 4 h 21 m and large variability in sleep timing (sleep-start SD ≈ 123 min) — short/irregular sleep is associated with higher PSS.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: marked overnight heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z > 1); the 1–2 AM deviation correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- These sleep/nocturnal signals could elevate perceived stress specifically via sleep-related distress or nighttime arousal.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might NOT have a higher PSS (protective evidence)
- Very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 2.0) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE = 32). These measures have strong correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ +0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.65), producing a strong downward pull on inferred PSS.
- Low resting heart rate and strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24-hr autocorrelation z-scores substantially above mean), both associated with lower PSS.
- Overall integration in the description concluded P1 is likely below their study mean (population mean = 21.21).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (elevated) — associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian fragmentation and variability: intradaily variability z ≈ 1.44, reduced interdaily stability z ≈ -0.9, sleep-start SD z ≈ 1.12, and elevated sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 128 min). These circadian/sleep irregularities are positively associated with PSS (though correlations are modest).
- Pronounced hourly HR deviations (strong morning and evening peaks, large negative nighttime deviations) indicating physiological contrast/reactivity; combined with rhythm fragmentation, this pattern can track with elevated perceived stress.
- The summary frames these as risk signals that push P2 toward higher perceived stress relative to their cohort mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might NOT have a higher PSS (protective evidence)
- Low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D = 7, STAI = 33) and high self-esteem and momentary happiness — robust psychological protections against high PSS.
- Adequate median sleep duration (~7 h 24 m) and very low resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ -1.49 and -2.13), indicating good fitness and low basal arousal — protective against high perceived stress.
- Social/behavioral supports (regular group exercise, limited substance use, good academic performance) that tend to lower PSS.
- The integrated conclusion for P2 is that inferred PSS is near their study mean (population mean = 21.61), not clearly above it.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is written relative to its own population mean. Participant 1’s strongest, highly correlated signals (very low GAD-7 and higher NGSE) point clearly below their mean PSS despite moderate sleep-based risk signals. The summary explicitly infers P1 is likely below the PSS mean (21.21).
- Participant 2 shows multiple sleep/circadian risk indicators and physiological fluctuation that push toward higher PSS, and fewer trait-level indicators with the very large predictive weight that P1 has (i.e., P1’s GAD-7 and NGSE relationships to PSS are especially strong). Although P2 also has many protective features, the net integration in the summary places P2 near their population mean (21.61), which is relatively higher than P1’s inferred below-mean status.
- Thus, when comparing relative positions within each study’s distribution, Participant 2 is inferred to have equal-to-slightly-higher perceived stress than average for their cohort, whereas Participant 1 is inferred to be below average. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; z = 0.67) — PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53), so this is a substantive risk signal.
- Very short median objective sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 216 min, z = 0.89; sleep onset SD z ≈ 0.34) — short and irregular sleep patterns strongly co-occur with elevated perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude; amplitude z = −0.84) — these features correlate negatively with well‑being in the sample and are consistent with higher stress exposure or poorer coping structure.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 Interpersonal = 17.67; z = 2.34) — notable interpersonal difficulties are a salient contextual source of ongoing perceived stress even if that subscale correlates weakly with PSS in the sample.
- Evening heart‑rate elevations and blunted circadian HR amplitude — physiological pattern that can accompany disrupted sleep/behavior and higher perceived burden.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not have a higher PSS (protective signs)
- Minimal current anxiety (GAD‑7 z = −1.38), low pain (PEG‑3/PAPAS z ≈ −1.29), and low emotional lability (z ≈ −1.27) — these argue against high concurrent subjective distress.
- Self‑efficacy near sample mean (NGSE z ≈ −0.07) and lower resting HR / MESOR — both are associated with lower PSS in the sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Few and relatively weak signals only: slightly elevated resting HR (62.8 bpm; z = 0.55; RHR–PSS r ≈ 0.14), somewhat lower momentary happiness (z ≈ −0.53), and low frequency of exercise — these factors could nudge PSS upward slightly but have small correlations with PSS in this sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have a higher PSS (protective signs)
- Low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 5; z ≈ −0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ −0.62) — both moderately correlated with PSS in the cohort.
- High self‑esteem (RSES z = 1.38) and high health/academic satisfaction.
- Good subjective sleep (PSQI = 3; z = −1.72) and very long, consistent objective sleep (median 8 h 42 min; z = 1.88; low sleep start SD) — strong protective indicators.
- Robust circadian heart‑rate structure (high interdaily stability, high autocorrelation, large amplitude; z’s ~ +1.5) and low intradaily variability — these features are consistently associated with lower PSS in this sample.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile must be interpreted relative to its cohort mean. Participant 1’s description explicitly concludes “near the mean, with a modest tilt toward being above the mean” for a population mean PSS = 21.29 (SD = 7.42). Key upward drivers for P1 are strong (very poor subjective sleep with a fairly large sample-level PSQI–PSS correlation, objective short/variable sleep, and marked interpersonal strain).
- Participant 2’s description explicitly concludes a PSS below their population mean (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). Multiple, convergent protective indicators (low depression/anxiety, very good subjective and objective sleep, robust circadian rhythms, high self‑esteem) are moderately to strongly aligned with lower PSS in that cohort. The few risk signals for P2 are small in magnitude and have weak sample-level correlations with PSS.
- The pattern of evidence for P2 is more uniformly protective and includes multiple measures with large z-scores in the protective direction. For P1, the strongest signals point toward elevated stress (sleep disruption and interpersonal problems), but these are partially counterbalanced by low anxiety and low pain. P1’s tilt above the mean is described as modest rather than extreme, whereas P2’s below-mean status is described as clearer and supported by several robust indicators.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows a clearer, multi-domain pattern consistent with lower-than-average perceived stress in their cohort.
- Participant 1, while mixed, has several substantial risk indicators (especially severe objective and subjective sleep disruption and interpersonal strain) and is judged in the summary to be near the mean with a modest tilt above it.
- Therefore, relative to each participant’s own study population, Participant 1 is likelier to have the higher PSS.

- Severe sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 (disturbed); objectively extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 m) and very late/variable sleep timing—sleep metrics that strongly align with elevated PSS.  
- Nighttime physiological arousal: elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations (+8–9 bpm at midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Circadian instability and elevated resting HR: flattened circadian amplitude, low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, and resting HR Z ≈ +1.67—patterns tied to greater perceived stress.

Several of these signals are extreme (very short sleep, marked nocturnal arousal) and converge across modalities.  
- Participant 2’s description characterizes PSS as near the study mean (mean = 21.61) with a modest tendency toward elevation. The strongest stress-like signals for P2 are objective (RHR/MESOR Z ≈ +2, circadian instability, late/variable sleep), but self-reported mood and anxiety measures are low (CES-D and STAI-T well below mean) and psychosocial resources are strong—factors that in this cohort predict lower PSS. The description emphasizes a mixed/discordant profile and concludes PSS is likely near, not clearly above, the population mean.
- In short, Participant 1 shows convergent, multi-modal evidence (strong self-report anxiety + extreme sleep disruption + nocturnal physiological arousal) that maps onto higher PSS relative to their cohort; Participant 2 shows mixed evidence with physiological signs of strain but strong protective self-report factors, resulting in an inference of PSS near the cohort mean.

3,33785,13,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean)
- Elevated affective symptoms: CES-D = 27 and STAI-T = 56 (both Z ≈ +1.4). Both measures have modest positive correlations with PSS in that cohort (r ≈ +0.29 and +0.32), making these the strongest indicators of above-mean stress for this participant.
- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 7 (above clinical cut-off) — PSQI is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Small physiological arousal signals: slightly elevated mesor and small evening heart-rate deviations, and resting HR near/just above mean; these align with modestly greater arousal associated with higher PSS.
- Holistic interpretation in the profile explicitly infers an above-mean PSS after weighing predictors.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5, and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in that cohort (r ≈ 0.47), making poor perceived sleep a substantive risk.
- Pain and interference: PEG/PAPAS scores indicate pain-related burden; those measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain: elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54) that could contribute to perceived stress.
- Small physiological elevations: mesor and resting HR are above sample mean (Z ≈ +1.2), which could reflect basal arousal associated with stress in some individuals.

Comparative, within-population considerations
- Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both Z ≈ +1.4). These features are potent individual-level predictors of higher PSS in that sample, and the case summary explicitly infers above-mean PSS.
- Participant 2 has a mix of risks (very poor subjective sleep, pain/interference, interpersonal strain) but also strong, large protective factors: high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41) which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63), low emotional lability, very robust circadian regularity, low substance use, and long objective sleep duration. The integrated interpretation for Participant 2 was near or slightly below the population mean.
- The key difference in predictive strength: Participant 1’s elevated mood/anxiety scores are direct, substantive predictors of higher PSS within their cohort. Participant 2’s largest single statistical relationship that favors lower PSS is NGSE (strong protective effect), which the profile states likely outweighs Participant 2’s risk factors.

Weighted conclusion
- Considering each profile in its own population frame and the relative strengths of risk vs. protective predictors, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (above their study mean), whereas Participant 2 is characterized as near or slightly below their study mean because of very strong protective resources.

15,28653,15,21,"Participant 1 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (if any):
- Median sleep start after midnight with substantial night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 107 min) — could produce daytime difficulties despite adequate total sleep.
- Pronounced afternoon heart-rate peak (3–4 PM, z ≈ +3.8) suggesting concentrated periods of physiological activation (situational stressors).
- Relatively little daily socializing (z ≈ −1.41), which could reduce social buffering during stressful periods.
Note: these signals are described as weaker or inconsistently correlated with PSS in this sample, and the overall multimodal profile for Participant 1 is characterized as below the population mean PSS.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS:
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5, Z ≈ +0.67), strongly associated with higher PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81, Z ≈ +0.93), also positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62), with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ −0.69), so below-average NGSE predicts higher PSS.
- Elevated cardiac activity (mesor and resting HR Zs ≈ +0.7 and +0.61) and marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations (midnight–3 AM; Zs up to ≈ +1.38), physiological markers that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83) and late acrophase, consistent with circadian irregularity linked to higher PSS.
Note: mitigating signs (GAD-7 low, relatively long nightly sleep duration, low intradaily variability) are present but the strongest and most directly PSS-correlated indicators (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE, nocturnal HR) point toward elevated perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame):
- Each participant’s description is explicitly framed relative to their own population mean PSS: Participant 1 is interpreted as below that study’s mean (21.62), while Participant 2 is interpreted as above their study’s mean (21.29).
- The number, magnitude, and directness of Participant 2’s risk markers for elevated PSS are greater: several measures with moderate-to-strong sample-level correlations to PSS (sleep quality, pain, self-efficacy, nocturnal HR) are elevated in Participant 2.
- Participant 1’s potential stress-related signals are fewer and described as weakly or inconsistently associated with PSS in that sample, while many other protective indicators (low CES-D/STAI, strong circadian amplitude and stability, low RHR, good subjective sleep quality, social exercise) point to lower perceived stress.
- Taking the strength and relevance of correlated measures into account, the balance of evidence favors Participant 2 as exhibiting the higher perceived stress.

- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI z = 0.76 and CES‑D z = 0.28; both positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28). These are moderate predictors of higher perceived stress.
- Very large night‑to‑night sleep variability and late/irregular sleep timing: sleep duration SD z = 2.75 (very large), sleep start median ≈ 03:03 and sleep start SD z = 1.21. Sleep variability/delayed timing correlate positively with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.13–0.17), so these are risk signals.
- Reduced circadian amplitude and lower MESOR (z ≈ -0.44 and -0.60) and somewhat blunted 24‑hour autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.28), consistent with circadian instability linked to higher stress.
- Behavioral risk factors: low exercise, more sedentary hobby time (z = 1.41), and relatively frequent beer consumption (z = 1.01) that could contribute to higher perceived stress.

Mitigating factors to note (reduce confidence that PSS is very high): adequate median sleep duration (~7 hours), no naps, above‑average momentary happiness (z = 0.55) and social time (z = 0.95), and lower resting heart rate (z ≈ -0.54). Overall the signals point to only modest elevation above the population mean (study mean = 21.61).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean)
- Very strong subjective risk signals: severe generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, z = 1.51) with a very high correlation to PSS (r = 0.74) — the single strongest predictor available.
- Pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI z = 1.65; r = 0.43) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z = 1.03; r = 0.63). These are large, convergent subjective indicators that correlate substantially with PSS.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS) and lower self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -0.44; NGSE–PSS r = -0.66), which further predict higher perceived stress in this sample.
- Convergent pattern of multiple high‑weight subjective predictors means a strong likelihood of being well above the cohort mean (study mean = 20.54).

Mitigating factors: wearable/physiological indicators show relatively organized circadian rhythms (interdaily stability z = 0.65, intradaily variability z = -0.59, amplitude z = 0.56) and low resting HR (z ≈ -0.9 to -1.35), features modestly associated with lower PSS (but correlations are smaller in magnitude than the GAD‑7 and BASIS correlations). Thus objective physiology appears resilient but does not outweigh the very strong subjective signal.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are described as above their respective population means, but the strength and magnitude of predictors differ. Participant 1’s strongest objective deviation is very large sleep variability (z = 2.75), but that feature has only a small-to-moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.13–0.17). Their psychological measures are only modestly elevated (STAI z = 0.76; CES‑D z = 0.28) and several protective factors are present.
- Participant 2 has multiple, large subjective elevations on measures that are highly correlated with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.74, BASIS‑24 r = 0.63, PSQI r = 0.43). These are both larger in z‑score magnitude and more strongly predictive of PSS than Participant 1’s strongest predictors. Although Participant 2’s wearable physiology is relatively organized (protective), those objective features have weaker associations with PSS than the subjectively reported anxiety/sleep/affect problems.

Balance of evidence and decision
- The convergent, high‑magnitude subjective indicators in Participant 2 (especially the very high GAD‑7 with r = 0.74) constitute stronger evidence for a substantially elevated PSS relative to that participant’s cohort than the more modest, mixed signals for Participant 1.
- Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

6,70492,20,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report correlates with PSS:
  - Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and in this sample GAD-7 has a very large correlation with PSS (r = 0.77), making anxiety a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress for this participant.
  - High subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13.5; r = 0.49) which is a moderate predictor of higher PSS.
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 score; z = 0.93; r = 0.67) associated with greater stress perception.
  - Low general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62; r = -0.66) — a substantial negative correlate, meaning lower self-efficacy strongly predicts higher PSS.
- Wearable/behavioral signals consistent with elevated arousal or disruption:
  - Elevated resting heart rate and MESOR (z ≈ 1.2–1.3), which can index higher baseline autonomic activation.
  - Large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.12) and relatively late sleep start time — patterns that often accompany higher stress.
- Balance of evidence: multiple high-correlation self-report measures that are markedly elevated point strongly to perceived stress above the study mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait symptoms that correlate with PSS:
  - Trait anxiety (STAI z = 0.76; r ≈ 0.31) and depressive symptoms (CES-D z = 0.28; r ≈ 0.28) — both positive correlates with PSS but with modest effect sizes compared to Participant 1’s strongest correlates.
- Marked circadian/sleep disruption:
  - Very high night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 2.75) and extremely late median sleep start (~03:03), plus reduced circadian amplitude (z = -0.44) and lower MESOR — these indicate circadian instability and irregular sleep timing associated with higher perceived stress in the dataset (though the correlations of these metrics with PSS are smaller than the strongest self-report predictors).
- Behavioral risk factors:
  - Low exercise, high sedentary hobby time (z = 1.41), and relatively frequent alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week, z = 1.01) which in this sample weakly relate to higher stress or lower resilience.
- Mitigating factors (reduce the net strength of evidence):
  - Adequate median sleep duration (~7 hr), minimal naps, lower resting heart rate (possible fitness/protection), higher momentary happiness (z = 0.55) and more social time (z = 0.95), all of which associate with lower PSS in this cohort to some degree.
- Balance of evidence: multiple indicators point to modestly above-mean PSS, but the self-report predictors have smaller correlations with PSS than Participant 1’s top predictors; some strong behavioral circadian disruption exists but those features have weaker PSS correlations.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are described as above their respective study means, but the strength and quality of the predictors differ:
  - Participant 1’s elevated measures include several self-report variables with large sample-level correlations to PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.67, NGSE r = -0.66). These are direct subjective measures strongly tied to perceived stress in this dataset, making the inference that Participant 1 is above the mean more robust.
  - Participant 2’s above-mean indications rely on measures with more modest correlations to PSS (STAI/CES-D r ≈ 0.28–0.31) and substantial circadian/sleep timing disruption that, while pronounced (e.g., sleep SD z = 2.75), only modestly correlates with PSS in the sample (sleep variability r ≈ 0.13–0.17). Participant 2 also has several protective factors (happiness, social time, adequate total sleep, low RHR) that temper the inference.
- Because Participant 1’s elevated features are both more directly subjective (strong anxiety, poor sleep quality, emotion dysregulation, low self-efficacy) and have much stronger sample-level correlations with PSS, the evidence that Participant 1’s perceived stress exceeds their cohort mean appears stronger and indicates a higher relative PSS than Participant 2’s evidence.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55; Z = +1.35) and the stated positive correlation of STAI with PSS — a strong self-report signal pointing toward higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate (70.8 bpm; Z = +1.50) indicating higher tonic autonomic arousal associated with stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8; Z = +0.59) plus large night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start SD Z = +0.86; sleep duration SD Z = +1.25), which are behavioral patterns linked to higher perceived stress.
- Markedly blunted circadian amplitude and very low interdaily stability (amplitude Z = −1.76; interdaily stability Z = −1.73), which in this cohort are associated with dysregulation and greater perceived stress.
- Lowered happiness and self-esteem (Z’s −0.53, −0.87) that add psychosocial risk for elevated perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not be highly stressed (mitigating factors):
- Low–moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = −0.34) and near-seven-hour median sleep duration (6 h 59 m; Z ≈ −0.24).
- Limited substance use and some social/leisure activities (exercise with others, lots of music listening), which could buffer stress.
- Some HR/circadian metrics (MESOR Z ≈ +0.41; acrophase within expected range) are not extreme.
- Several strong indicators in this profile (esp. physiological/circadian) have only modest correlations with PSS in the sample, reducing certainty.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and very strong correlation with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.77), making this a high-weight indicator of elevated perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) with a substantial correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86) with moderate correlations (~0.45–0.49) to PSS, which typically co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9) with a strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.66).
- Wearable-derived circadian blunting (amplitude Z = −1.51) and low interdaily stability (Z = −0.75) consistent with elevated stress risk.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not be highly stressed (mitigating factors):
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ −0.68), a substantial protective factor.
- Low interpersonal difficulties (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ −1.27), which tends to lower PSS.
- Lower resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ −0.9 and −1.4), suggesting lower tonic physiological arousal or better fitness; wearable HR metrics have small-to-modest correlations with PSS in this cohort, so physiological buffering is plausible.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Both participants are judged “above the population mean” in their respective study contexts. However, the types and weights of indicators differ.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are physiological/circadian dysregulation and elevated trait anxiety. Several of these signals (HR, circadian amplitude/stability) show notable Z-scores (±1.5 to ~1.8), but the summary notes that many wearable/circadian metrics have only modest correlations with PSS in the cohort.
- Participant 2 presents multiple self-report measures that are both elevated and reported to have large correlations with PSS in that study (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; PSQI r ≈ 0.49; pain measures r ≈ 0.45–0.49). Those measures are generally stronger, more direct predictors of PSS than the physiological/circadian markers emphasized for Participant 1.
- Participant 2 also has meaningful protective factors (high self-efficacy and low interpersonal problems) that attenuate risk, but the magnitude and number of high-correlation risk indicators for Participant 2 (clinically elevated anxiety, very poor PSQI, pain, emotional lability) likely carry more predictive weight for elevated PSS than Participant 1’s pattern, particularly given the reported correlation strengths.

Overall judgment:
- Taking into account the relative predictive weights (correlations with PSS) provided in each summary, Participant 2’s profile is more strongly characterized by several high-weight, self-report risk factors that reliably predict higher PSS in that cohort (notably GAD-7 and PSQI), despite some protective factors.
- Participant 1 shows meaningful signs of elevated stress, particularly physiologic/circadian dysregulation and trait anxiety, but many of those signals have smaller predictive associations with PSS in the sample and there are more mitigating indicators.

1,77036,17,23,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1's study population)
- Very large subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11.5, classified ""Disturbed Sleep"") — PSQI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Extremely short objective sleep (median ~3 h 30 m) and very late sleep onset (median ≈ 03:37 AM) — short/shifted sleep strongly associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) — pain measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67 overnight) and reduced circadian amplitude/autocorrelation — physiological arousal and attenuated rhythm robustness are linked to higher PSS.
- Convergence of multiple moderate-to-strong risk signals (sleep + pain + nocturnal arousal) gives a consistent signal of elevated perceived stress versus the sample mean.

(Notes: There are meaningful protective signals — low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability — but the high-magnitude sleep/pain/physiology abnormalities were judged to outweigh those in the original synthesis.)

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2's study population)
- Subjective sleep complaint (PSQI = 6, “Disturbed Sleep”) despite objectively regular timing; PSQI is positively associated with PSS.
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI ≈ 43, z ≈ +0.17) which correlates positively with PSS.
- Modestly higher resting heart rate (61.2 bpm, z ≈ +0.36), small positive correlation with PSS.
- Low social/recreational engagement (socializing z ≈ -1.41) and somewhat lower self-rated health (z ≈ -0.53), which reduce coping resources and can elevate perceived stress.
- Slightly short average sleep duration (~6 h 51 m, z ≈ -0.41), which can contribute to stress.

(Notes: These risk signals are modest in magnitude and are counterbalanced by strong objective circadian stability, low depressive symptoms, above-average happiness, and low substance use — factors linked to lower PSS in this sample.)

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Participant 1’s elevated-risk indicators are larger in magnitude and more concordant: extremely curtailed objective sleep (3.5 h), high PSQI (11.5), elevated pain (PEG Z +1.33), and nocturnal physiological activation. These features have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS and were interpreted as pushing Participant 1 above their population mean (21.21).
- Participant 2’s risk indicators are smaller and more mixed: PSQI = 6 and modest trait anxiety/resting HR/social isolation could nudge PSS upward relative to their population, but objective physiology (very strong interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation, low intradaily variability), low depressive symptoms, and positive affect provide substantial buffering. The original synthesis placed Participant 2 near the population mean (21.61) with a modest lean toward slightly below.
- In sum, Participant 1 shows multiple high-impact, concordant stress-related abnormalities (sleep deprivation, pain, nocturnal arousal) that are larger and more directly tied to higher PSS in that sample than the relatively modest and mixed risk signals observed for Participant 2.

These sleep features are strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50) and are large deviations from the sample.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 (mild anxiety) with very strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = 0.43 (r with PSS ≈ 0.68). These are high-weight predictors in this dataset.
- Substance-related difficulties and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — additional stress contributors.
- Circadian/physiological dysregulation: reduced interdaily stability (Z = -1.42), low amplitude (Z = -1.10), and low 24-hr autocorrelation — patterns associated with higher stress.
- Multiple high-correlation signals align in the same (higher-stress) direction, and some of these (sleep measures, anxiety) are extreme in magnitude.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular indices: resting HR 64.6 bpm (Z ≈ +0.77) and mesor Z ≈ +1.81; these have small positive correlations with PSS (resting HR r ≈ +0.14) and could reflect increased sympathetic tone.
- Lifestyle/behavioral risk signals: very low physical activity (exercise 1–2×/month; negative z-scores) and above-average alcohol use (≈1–2×/week; z ≈ +1.0).
- Some lower well-being signal: self-reported current happiness below mean (z ≈ -0.53).
- These upward cues exist but are modest in size and generally have weak correlations with PSS in the sample.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Directionality relative to each study mean: Participant 1’s profile is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean (mean PSS = 21.33), driven by several large, highly PSS-correlated measures. Participant 2’s profile is explicitly inferred to be below their population mean (mean PSS = 21.62), driven by very strong protective indicators (CES-D = 0, below-average trait anxiety, long regular sleep, low intradaily variability).
- Magnitude and predictive weight: Participant 1’s key indicators (sleep disruption, anxiety, emotional lability, substance problems) have larger effect sizes/correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.78; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68; PSQI r ≈ 0.50) and some measures are extreme (very short sleep, high variability). Participant 2’s risk signals (resting HR, mesor, alcohol use, low activity) are smaller in magnitude and have weaker associations with PSS (many |r| < 0.20).
- Balance of evidence: Participant 1 shows multiple strong, convergent indicators of elevated perceived stress relative to their cohort; Participant 2 shows multiple strong, convergent indicators of lower perceived stress relative to their cohort, with only modest contradictory signals.

Overall determination
- Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 2.

- Elevated resting heart rate and MESOR (RHR Z = 1.19; mesor Z = 1.24) similar to or slightly higher than Participant 1.
- Blunted diurnal amplitude (amplitude Z = -1.05), low interdaily stability (IS Z = -0.46) and high intradaily variability (IV Z = 1.07) indicating substantial circadian fragmentation—features associated with higher PSS.
- Pronounced early-morning heart-rate elevations (several hours with Z > 1) that are moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).

Comparative weighing (within each participant’s population frame):
- Strength and relevance of self-report predictors: Participant 2’s top self-report measures are both more strongly correlated with PSS and show substantive deviations (GAD-7 r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66; PSQI r ≈ 0.49). Participant 1’s psychological elevations (STAI, CES-D) are present but with smaller correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28).
- Objective physiologic/circadian disruption: Both show elevated RHR and MESOR (similar Zs), but Participant 2 additionally shows a blunted amplitude, lower interdaily stability, higher IV, and extremely short median sleep — a combination indicating more pervasive circadian and sleep pathology. Participant 1’s standout physiologic signal is an extremely large evening HR spike (Z ≈ 5.94), but other circadian metrics are more moderate and there are several protective behaviors (regular exercise, high reading, higher IS).
- Overall balance of risk vs protective factors: Participant 1 has several protective features (regular exercise, low substance use, high reading) that likely buffer perceived stress; Participant 2 has fewer buffering signals and multiple high-impact risk signals (very short sleep, strong anxiety/emotional-lability links to PSS, circadian flattening/fragmentation).
- Magnitude and predictive value: Many of Participant 2’s deviations map onto measures with high PSS correlations, increasing confidence that their perceived stress is elevated relative to their sample to a greater degree than Participant 1’s profile.

Conclusion:
Based on the comparative balance of evidence (stronger, highly PSS-correlated self-report elevations and more severe circadian/sleep disruption in Participant 2 versus more moderate elevations plus meaningful protective behaviors in Participant 1), Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Some trait anxiety and HR signals: STAI = 42 (Z ≈ +0.07) and trait anxiety correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31); certain early-morning HR deviations show modest positive correlations with PSS (up to ~0.21).  
- (Counterpoints) Several protective factors that lower inferred PSS: low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 8), relatively high self-esteem (Rosenberg = 40), minimal substance use, normal BMI, good academic performance, and relatively low resting HR (55.5 bpm). These moderate the inference that PSS is high.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both profiles are explicitly characterized as “above the study mean” in their respective descriptions, but the nature and strength of the signals differ. Participant 1’s elevated anxiety (GAD-7) has an exceptionally strong sample-level association with PSS (r = 0.80), and multiple converging physiological markers (nocturnal HR elevations with moderate correlations up to ~0.42, elevated resting HR, circadian flattening) and severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) further align with higher PSS. These are direct indicators that—relative to that study’s distribution—this participant’s predictors of PSS are tightly clustered around measures known to explain PSS variance in that sample.  
- Participant 2 shows more extreme objective sleep/timing departures (very short mean sleep, enormous sleep-start variability Z = +7.44) that plausibly drive PSS upward relative to that study’s population. However, those sleep/rhythm metrics in this description are accompanied by multiple strong protective self-report and behavioral indicators (low depression, high self-esteem, minimal substance use, good GPA, low resting HR). The correlations cited for participant-2’s main psychological contributors (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31; HR hourly correlations up to ~0.21) are smaller than the strongest correlations reported for Participant 1 (GAD-7 r = 0.80; nocturnal HR r up to ~0.42).  

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple high-impact signals that are strongly associated with PSS in that cohort (very strong anxiety–PSS correlation plus physiological nocturnal arousal and severe subjective sleep disturbance) point to a robust inference of elevated perceived stress.  
- Participant 2: extreme and highly deviant sleep/timing features are compelling drivers of higher PSS, but the effect is mitigated by numerous protective factors and the psychological/physiological variables that are reported to correlate with PSS have smaller effect sizes in the provided summaries.  
- Because Participant 1’s top predictors of PSS include an anxiety measure with an exceptionally large correlation (r = 0.80) and multiple other convergent markers with moderate correlations to PSS, the overall balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit a higher PSS relative to their study mean than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 19; sample correlation with PSS ≈ 0.28) and some trait anxiety (STAI = 40; r ≈ 0.31) — both are positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Mildly elevated cardiovascular tone (resting HR and mesor z ≈ 0.36 and 0.85) and early-morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.22).
- Small positive relation of intradaily variability with PSS (r ≈ 0.16); any increase in fragmentation tends to align with higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report predictors of higher perceived stress: moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) with a very large sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.77); high emotional lability (BASIS-24; r = 0.67); poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r = 0.49); and low general self-efficacy (NGSE; r = -0.66). These variables are tightly linked to higher PSS in this dataset.
- Somatic/functional burden (pain interference PEG-3; r ≈ 0.44) that tends to increase stress appraisal.
- Physiological and behavioral indicators consistent with stress: substantially elevated resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ 1.31 and 1.19), large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ 1.12), and late sleep timing — all of which align with higher stress in many contexts.
- The study summary explicitly characterizes this participant as “above the population mean” based primarily on strong self-report correlates.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Each description is relative to its own sample mean PSS (P1 mean = 21.61; P2 mean = 21.08). The absolute difference in population means is negligible, so the relevant comparison is the participant-to-sample signal.
- Participant 1: mixed but largely balanced profile. The self-report/physiology indicators that point toward higher stress are modest (small-to-moderate sample correlations and small z-scores), while multiple strong protective factors are present (robust circadian regularity, low night-to-night sleep variability, good subjective sleep/PSQI relative to that sample, no substance use, high self-esteem). The study summary concludes P1 is near the sample mean with only a modest upward bias.
- Participant 2: multiple, large-magnitude self-report predictors with strong sample-level correlations to PSS (especially GAD‑7 r = 0.77, NGSE r = -0.66, BASIS‑24 r = 0.67). Several wearable/physiological indicators (high resting HR/MESOR, high sleep variability) also support higher stress. Although some wearable rhythm metrics are mixed/protective, the dominant signal comes from highly predictive self-report measures. The study summary explicitly infers P2 is above their sample mean.

Weighting of evidence
- The evidence for elevated perceived stress is stronger for Participant 2: multiple high-correlation self-report measures and corroborating physiological markers with larger z-scores. 
- Participant 1 shows some risk signals but they are weaker and counterbalanced by several robust protective factors (notably circadian stability and low sleep variability), leading to an inference near the sample mean rather than meaningfully above it.

- Clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.48).  
- Very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 m) and large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), both sleep features often linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Pronounced nocturnal heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., 1–2 AM = +14.62 bpm; z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation moderately correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.46), suggesting nighttime physiological arousal that can elevate perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (based on their description)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86), a dispositional factor associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31 in the sample).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, z = 1.52) plus shortened sleep (median ≈ 6 h 14 m, z ≈ -1.17) and very late sleep onset (~02:02), sleep patterns commonly linked with higher perceived stress.  
- Relatively high variability in sleep duration and some behavioral indicators (less social/leisure activity, slightly lower self-esteem) that reduce stress-buffering resources and tend to associate with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study population frame
- Participant 1 is described relative to a population mean PSS = 21.21. Although they show strong sleep-related risk signals, their daytime/trait indicators most strongly tied to PSS are protective: minimal anxiety (GAD-7 = 2.0, z ≈ -1.29) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +0.30). Critically, GAD-7 has a very large positive correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.77) and NGSE a strong negative correlation (r ≈ -0.65). Those high-correlation protective signals outweigh the moderate-correlation sleep signals in the integrated inference, and the summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely below their population mean PSS.  
- Participant 2 is described relative to a population mean PSS = 21.61. They have at least two substantial risk signals for higher PSS in that cohort: elevated trait anxiety and marked subjective sleep disturbance/timing problems. The description concludes this combination yields an inferred PSS modestly above the study mean, despite some protective physiological markers (low RHR, preserved circadian stability) and functional successes (high GPA, modestly higher happiness).

Weighing the overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: Strong protective trait signals with large correlations to PSS (especially very low GAD-7) argue that their overall perceived stress is below their cohort mean despite severe sleep issues.  
- Participant 2: Elevated trait anxiety plus marked subjective sleep disturbance/timing together form the principal drivers of elevated inferred PSS in their cohort; the magnitude and number of above-mean risk indicators lead to an inference of PSS above their cohort mean.

Final determination
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

25,37218,21,14,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety and poor subjective sleep: GAD‑7 = 6 (mild anxiety), and PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep). Both measures have substantive positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD r = 0.78, PSQI r = 0.49), so even modest elevations are meaningful.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG‑3 average 6.78 and PAPAS z ≈ +0.24; both correlate positively with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Circadian irregularity and very high sleep variability: interdaily stability z = -0.68, 24‑h autocorr z = -0.35, and sleep duration SD z = +1.7 (large). These objective disturbances typically co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal z ≈ +0.54, a moderate signal linked to stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might not have higher PSS (protective factors)
- Moderately high self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +0.3) and a strong negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.65), which is a robust buffer.
- No substance problems (BASIS‑24 substance z ≈ -1.62), low emotional lability, and near‑normal resting HR. These reduce the likelihood of very high PSS.
- Long median sleep duration (z ≈ +1.19) which could be restorative despite poor subjective quality.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive and trait anxiety symptoms: CES‑D z ≈ +1.11 and STAI trait z ≈ +0.76; both positively associated with PSS.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance and objectively short, late sleep: PSQI z ≈ +1.52, median sleep duration z ≈ -1.45, very late median sleep start (~03:56) and ~74 min variability — a convergent set strongly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and some within‑day fragmentation: amplitude z ≈ -0.63 and intradaily variability slightly above mean; these patterns are associated with higher stress.
- Physiological nocturnal arousal: elevated late‑night HR and modestly elevated mesor/RHR (z ≈ +0.3) suggesting nocturnal arousal that could increase perceived stress.
- Low exercise/inactivity (large negative z for exercise frequency), which is commonly associated with higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might not have higher PSS (protective factors)
- No substance use (strong protective z), good academic performance (GPA 3.76), some social/leisure engagement, and above‑average interdaily stability/autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.58 and +0.31), which mitigate but do not eliminate risk signals.

Comparative evaluation (within each study’s population frame)
- Magnitude and convergence of risk indicators: Participant 2 shows multiple, moderately large positive z‑scores on constructs with known positive correlations to PSS (PSQI ≈ +1.52, CES‑D ≈ +1.11, STAI ≈ +0.76, sleep duration ≈ -1.45). These are convergent (affect + sleep + physiology) and fairly substantive relative to their population mean.
- Participant 1 shows several risk signals (subjective disturbed sleep, pain, mild anxiety, very high sleep variability z = +1.7) but also notable, relatively strong protective factors (self‑efficacy and very low substance problems). The single very large z in Participant 1 is sleep variability (z = +1.7), but other risk indicators are smaller in magnitude or conflicted by protective signals.
- Correlational weighting: Participant 1’s GAD‑7 has a very high sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), but the participant’s absolute GAD score is only mild (6), reducing its likely impact. Participant 2’s profile includes larger standardized deviations on multiple affective and sleep measures that themselves have non‑trivial correlations with PSS.
- Overall balance: Participant 2 has more numerous and consistently elevated risk indicators (affective symptoms + subjective and objective short/late sleep + circadian blunting + nocturnal HR) with fewer protective factors of comparable strength. Participant 1’s risk profile is mixed and more strongly offset by protective factors (notably self‑efficacy and absence of substance problems).

Conclusion
Given the within‑study comparisons and the relative magnitudes and convergence of stress‑related indicators, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Severe self‑reported anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = +1.25) — in this sample GAD‑7 is very strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.81), so this is a high‑weight indicator of elevated perceived stress.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83) — PSQI also shows a substantial positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.51).
- Elevated physiological arousal (resting HR Z ≈ +1.53; mesor Z ≈ +1.49) consistent with sustained stress-related autonomic activation.
- Behavioral sleep abnormalities (very short median wearable sleep ~2.5 h, late and variable sleep timing) that concord with subjective sleep complaints and point toward disrupted recovery.
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62) and moderate pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS), both of which correlate with higher PSS in this sample.
- Some functional and emotional lability signals (BASIS‑24 elevations) and interpersonal/substance‑related items that compound psychosocial strain.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very high trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 62; Z ≈ +2.05) and elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 28; Z ≈ +1.53). Both are associated with higher PSS in this sample (moderate correlations).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05) and low reported happiness (Z ≈ −1.61), which typically track with greater perceived stress.
- Lower self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ −1.57) and reduced social/leisure engagement, consistent with higher psychosocial burden.
- Mildly elevated resting HR and small increases in intradaily variability (Z’s ≈ +0.56 and +0.10), suggesting modestly increased physiological arousal/fragmentation.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are interpreted as above their respective study means, but the strength and weighting of indicators differ. For Participant 1, the strongest predictors in that sample (severe GAD and very poor PSQI) are present and those measures have large sample correlations with PSS (particularly GAD‑7 with r = 0.81). Participant 1 also shows elevated resting HR and pain/interference, adding physiological and somatic weight to the self‑report signals.
- For Participant 2, the self‑report signals (very high trait anxiety and depressive symptoms) are marked in z‑score terms (STAI Z ≈ +2.05), but in that study those measures have only moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28). Participant 2 also has several protecting/mitigating features (objectively long nightly sleep, low napping, regular circadian metrics, regular exercise and no drug misuse) that reduce the overall likelihood of extreme perceived stress despite the strong psychological symptom elevations.

Weighing the overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple high‑weight indicators that, in this sample, are strongly associated with PSS (especially severe GAD and poor subjective sleep), plus elevated physiological arousal and pain — a convergent pattern pointing to pronounced perceived stress above the sample mean.
- Participant 2: notable and large z‑score elevations in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, but those measures have only moderate sample correlations with PSS and are offset by objective protective factors (adequate objective sleep, exercise, circadian regularity) that materially mitigate the inference of extreme perceived stress.

- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations: Some early-morning HR deviations (Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), suggesting a modest linkage between certain night-time cardiovascular patterns and higher stress for this participant.
(Overall: these are relatively isolated and modest signals compared with strong protective indicators.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Circadian/within-day instability: Intradaily variability IV = 0.76 (Z = 1.51) is meaningfully elevated and positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.17), consistent with greater stress-related fragmentation.
- Large evening heart-rate elevations: Very large positive departures from mesor in late evening (e.g., +22.05 bpm at 10–11 pm, Z = 2.46) and elevated afternoon/evening HR more broadly—these sizable deviations likely reflect elevated physiological arousal linked to higher PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (“disturbed sleep”), which is associated with higher perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction: Score ≈ 2.67 (Z ≈ -1.2), modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Some early-morning HR deviations with modest positive correlations with PSS.
(These risk signals are balanced by several protective factors, but the circadian fragmentation and pronounced evening-arousal signals are notable.)

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as likely below their study sample mean (population mean 21.5). The strongest, high-weight signals for P1 are very large protective effects: maximal NGSE (Z ≈ +1.79) with strong negative NGSE–PSS correlation (r = -0.60) and very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -1.38) with strong positive GAD–PSS correlation (r = 0.75). Objective physiology (very low RHR Z = -2.23, high circadian stability and amplitude Zs ≈ +1.4–+1.9) further supports below-mean perceived stress. The countervailing signals (PSQI and modest nocturnal HR correlations) are weaker in magnitude and fewer in number.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the study mean (population mean 21.62), leaning slightly below. Compared with P1, P2 has several notable indicators associated with higher PSS within their cohort: markedly elevated IV (Z = 1.51), very large evening HR elevation (Z = 2.46), PSQI = 6, and low health satisfaction. P2 also has protective signals (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, good sleep duration, exercise, lower RHR), but the presence of pronounced evening arousal and circadian fragmentation makes P2’s stress burden closer to average and relatively higher than P1’s.
- Relative effect-size and correlation considerations: P1’s strongest protective markers (especially very low GAD and very high self-efficacy) are tied to large sample correlations with PSS and have large Z deviations; P2’s risk markers include very large Z for evening HR and elevated IV but protective trait scores are less extreme than P1’s protective markers. Overall, P1’s profile shows stronger, more consistent downward pressure on PSS than P2’s profile.

Conclusion (which participant likely exhibits higher PSS)
Based on the within-sample framings and the balance of indicators, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (i.e., P2’s PSS is closer to/above the cohort mean relative to P1).

- Low positive affect and self-esteem (happy z = -1.61; RSES z = -1.43), which are negatively correlated with PSS (modest correlations) and thus support higher stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) despite long objective sleep — the subjective sleep complaints and possible nonrestorative/fragmented sleep are commonly tied to higher perceived stress.
- Low socializing and infrequent exercise remove common behavioral buffers against stress.
- Although objective circadian/physiologic markers (longer sleep duration, strong interdaily stability and HR amplitude, normal resting HR) are relatively protective, the psychological symptom burden is large and the summary explicitly interprets the profile as above the population mean (mean PSS = 21.61).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Several self-report indicators that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS: GAD-7 (r ≈ 0.77; GAD-7 = 10), high PSQI (13.5; r ≈ 0.49), elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 0.93; r ≈ 0.67), and lower general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62; r ≈ -0.66). These variables collectively are powerful predictors of higher PSS in this dataset.
- Physiological/behavioral signs consistent with higher arousal or disruption: elevated resting HR and MESOR (resting HR z = 1.31), high night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.12), and late sleep timing — all commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- The integrated summary for this participant also concludes their PSS is likely above the population mean (mean PSS = 21.08).
- Offsetting protections (median ~7 h sleep, low intradaily variability, some circadian consolidation) temper but do not eliminate the influence of the strong self-report predictors.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Magnitude of deviation: Participant 1 shows very large deviations on core psychological symptom scales (CES-D z = 2.67; STAI-T z = 1.85; happiness z = -1.61), whereas Participant 2’s largest z-scores on self-report are more moderate (emotional lability z ≈ 0.93; NGSE z ≈ -0.62; GAD-7 z ≈ 0.11). Large z-deviations in Participant 1 indicate a stronger absolute departure from that study population’s norm on measures that relate to PSS.
- Predictor strength (correlations): Some of Participant 2’s predictors have very high correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD r ≈ 0.77, emotional lability r ≈ 0.67, NGSE r ≈ -0.66), meaning even moderate deviations could imply meaningful PSS elevation. Participant 1’s correlational links to PSS are more modest (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), but the participant’s z-deviations on those measures are large enough that, when combined, they likely translate into a substantial PSS increase.
- Physiologic data: Participant 1’s objective physiology and circadian metrics are relatively protective (strong interdaily stability, higher HR amplitude, normal resting HR, long consistent sleep), which the profile notes do not outweigh the pronounced psychological symptom burden. Participant 2 has more physiological signals of elevated arousal (high resting HR, high MESOR, high sleep variability) that reinforce self-report, but also some rhythm consolidation that is protective.
- Overall balance: Participant 1 shows an extreme psychological symptom burden (notably very high depressive symptoms and elevated trait anxiety) that is likely to drive PSS well above that study’s mean despite protective physiologic rhythms. Participant 2 shows multiple strong, correlated predictors of higher PSS (especially subjective sleep disturbance, emotion lability, and lower self-efficacy) and physiological signs of arousal, but the deviations from that study’s norms are generally smaller in magnitude than Participant 1’s largest z-scores.

Decision
Weighing the very large psychological symptom deviations in Participant 1 (particularly the extreme depression score and elevated trait anxiety) against Participant 2’s multiple, strongly correlated but more moderately deviant indicators, Participant 1 most plausibly exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Objective circadian disruption: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.15), very low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), and high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.44) — pattern linked to worse stress-related outcomes.
- Elevated tonic cardiac activity: MESOR Z ≈ +1.56 and resting heart rate Z ≈ +1.34, consistent with sustained physiological arousal; these metrics show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- STAI (trait anxiety) modestly elevated and positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Net effect: several moderate-to-large z-scores on measures associated with PSS, leading the study authors to infer above-mean perceived stress.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD-7 = 10, with a very large correlation with PSS in this cohort (r = 0.77) — one of the strongest single predictors in the description.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 13.5 with moderate-to-large correlation with PSS (r = 0.49); objectively very short recorded sleep (median ≈ 3 h 55 min).
- High emotional lability: BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9, with strong association to PSS (r = 0.66).
- Elevated pain and pain-related interference: PEG-3 = 7.89, PAPAS = 86; correlations with PSS ~0.45–0.49, indicating meaningful contribution to perceived stress.
- Circadian/wearable signals consistent with stress risk: reduced HR amplitude (Z ≈ −1.51), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.75), compressed/flattened diurnal HR pattern; short/fragmented sleep is linked to higher PSS.
- Protective factors present but imperfect: high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r = −0.68), relatively low interpersonal difficulty (Z ≈ −1.27), and lower resting HR/mesor (Z ≈ −0.9, −1.4). These attenuate risk but do not negate multiple strong self-report risk signals.
- Net effect: several high-impact self-report measures (anxiety, emotional lability, pain, PSQI) that have large correlations with PSS in this cohort, supporting an inference of above-mean perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning (within-sample frame)
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2 exhibits multiple self-report indicators that both are clinically elevated and have very large correlations with PSS in their sample (GAD-7 r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66; NGSE r = −0.68 as a protective but not fully offsetting factor). Participant 1’s strongest links to PSS are elevated depressive symptoms and sleep/circadian disruption, but the described correlations for those measures with PSS are smaller on average (STAI r ≈ 0.31; physiological correlations described as small-to-moderate).
- Magnitude & clinical relevance: P2’s GAD-7 at the screening threshold, very short sleep duration, high emotional lability, and high pain interference are severe and are each described as strong predictors of PSS in that cohort. P1 shows several moderate z-scores across domains (CES-D, PSQI, MESOR) indicative of above-mean stress, but these risk indicators appear less tightly coupled to PSS in their sample than P2’s top predictors.
- Protective factors: Both participants have buffers. P1’s low substance use, good academic functioning, and preserved self-esteem moderate risk but do not eliminate it. P2’s high self-efficacy and lower resting HR/mesor are substantial protective signals (strong negative correlation of NGSE with PSS), yet multiple very strong positive predictors remain.
- Overall balance: While both participants are inferred to be above their sample means, Participant 2’s elevated measures are more concentrated in variables that have larger associations with PSS in that cohort, and several of those measures are clinically meaningful (anxiety, severe subjective sleep disturbance, emotional lability, pain). Thus the evidence indicates a larger expected deviation above the study mean for Participant 2 than for Participant 1.

22,99733,10,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean 21.62)
- Circadian fragmentation: Intradaily variability is relatively high (IV Z ≈ +1.09), a physiological marker that modestly correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ +0.16).
- Reduced 24-hour rhythm stability: Lower 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53) and reduced circadian amplitude (amp Z ≈ −0.43) — both associated (modestly) with higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated resting heart rate (RHR Z ≈ +0.53) and atypical overnight→morning HR deviations (early-morning hourly deviations linked modestly to PSS) suggesting greater autonomic arousal.
- Irregular sleep timing/duration (sleep start SD ≈ 65 min; duration SD ≈ 86 min) which have small positive correlations with PSS in this cohort.
Notes: These physiological/behavioral signals are mostly modestly correlated with PSS (r values ~0.14–0.22) and conflict with strong self-report protections.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean 21.5)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: Very high PSQI (16; Z ≈ +0.83) and PSQI–PSS correlation is substantial (r ≈ 0.58), making this a strong upward predictor of PSS.
- Objective sleep indications that align with poor sleep: median wearable sleep ≈ 1 h 44 min (Z ≈ −1.24) and highly variable sleep start times (SD ≈ 160 min), which—despite possible artifact—converge with the high PSQI to indicate serious sleep problems tied to higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Zs ≈ +0.7–0.8) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal that correlate positively with PSS (hourly r up to ~0.42).
Notes: These risk signals (especially PSQI and pain) have stronger correlations with PSS than the physiological signals seen in Participant 1.

Comparative, within-frame considerations
- Population means are nearly identical (21.62 vs 21.5), so inferred PSS comparisons are on the same scale.
- Participant 1’s upward signals are primarily physiological (IV, RHR, reduced amplitude, irregular sleep timing) but each has only small-to-modest associations with PSS (r roughly 0.14–0.22). Crucially, P1 reports very low depressive and anxiety symptoms (large negative Zs), high self-esteem, and good subjective sleep—strong self-report indicators of lower PSS that counterbalance physiological risk.
- Participant 2’s upward signals include two relatively strong, convergent predictors of higher PSS: subjective sleep quality (PSQI, r ≈ 0.58) and pain/interference (r ≈ 0.52–0.56). Although Participant 2 also has robust protective assets (very low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, strong circadian physiology), the combination of high PSQI and elevated pain are substantive upward drivers and are described as producing a modest elevation above the cohort mean.
- Strength of associations favors Participant 2 as more likely to have higher perceived stress: the sleep and pain metrics for P2 are more strongly correlated with PSS than the physiological markers that push P1 upward. P1’s strongest signal (IV Z ≈ +1.09) is informative but, in-sample, less predictive of PSS than P2’s PSQI and pain measures.

Verdict
On balance, Participant 2 shows stronger, higher-weighted predictors of elevated perceived stress (notably high PSQI and pain/interference) even though both profiles are characterized as “near the mean” with modest upward tilts. Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

25,19245,21,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population):
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6), and GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.78), so even mild anxiety is a salient contributor.
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13), which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Pain interference (PEG‑3 = 6.78; PAPAS z ≈ +0.24) that correlates positively with PSS.
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = -0.68), low 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -0.35), very high night‑to‑night sleep duration variability (SD z = +1.7) — patterns commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = +0.54).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 26, z = +1.32) and trait anxiety (STAI = 55, z = +1.35); both are >1 SD above the sample mean and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
- Low wellbeing/trust (happy z = -1.61; trust z = -2.07), which align with higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) plus markedly late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep onset 02:38; sleep SD z ≈ +1.23; sleep start SD z ≈ +0.92).
- Objective signs of nocturnal physiological activation: large positive hourly heart‑rate deviations in late evening (z’s up to +2.25), consistent with nocturnal arousal that would increase perceived stress.
- Reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.82) and flattened circadian amplitude — indicative of irregular daily rhythm linked to higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Severity and consistency of high‑loading affective indicators are greater for Participant 2. Participant 2 has two core affective measures (depression and trait anxiety) >1 SD above that population’s mean, plus strong negative wellbeing/trust signals. Participant 1’s prominent affective signal is milder (GAD‑7 = 6, “mild” anxiety) though it is especially predictive in that sample due to a high correlation with PSS.
- Objective/physiological evidence: both show circadian instability and sleep timing variability, but Participant 1’s largest objective signal is extreme sleep duration variability (z ≈ +1.7) while Participant 2 shows very large late‑evening HR deviations (z up to +2.25) and substantial variability in sleep timing (z ≈ +1.2). The late‑night HR activation in Participant 2 is a stronger acute physiological signal of nocturnal arousal than Participant 1’s modest HR deviations.
- Protective factors differ in strength and number. Participant 1 has notable protective features (relatively high self‑efficacy z ≈ +0.3, no substance problems z ≈ -1.62, normative resting HR), which are described as strongly negatively correlated with PSS in that sample. Participant 2 also has protections (long objective sleep duration z ≈ +1.14, low resting HR z ≈ -1.02, regular exercise and good social/leisure engagement z’s ≈ +1), but these appear to coexist with more severe affective symptomatology (>1 SD).
- Taking correlations into account: Participant 1’s single highly predictive self‑report (GAD‑7) is influential, but its absolute severity is mild. Participant 2’s multiple measures that load on perceived stress are larger in magnitude relative to that study’s population (several z > +1, large negative wellbeing z’s), producing a stronger multivariate signal of elevated PSS.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Both profiles are judged more likely above their respective population means, but Participant 2 demonstrates more and larger deviations on high‑weight affective measures (depression and trait anxiety >1 SD) and a strong physiological night‑time arousal signature. Participant 1 shows meaningful stress‑related risk signals (sleep disturbance, pain, circadian irregularity) but also stronger buffering resources (self‑efficacy, no substance problems) and milder affective symptom severity.
- Therefore, relative to their own populations, Participant 2’s profile indicates a higher overall probability of being at a greater level of perceived stress than Participant 1.

2,24029,38,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean of 20.33)
- Very high clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 21; Z ≈ 2.04, “severe”), a strong positive correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ 1.49) and corroborating wearable data showing extremely short median sleep (3 h 42 min) and large night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min). Severe sleep restriction and fragmentation are strongly linked to higher perceived stress.
- High pain and interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ 2.28), which tends to elevate perceived stress.
- Large emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ 2.42), consistent with higher stress.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), removing a coping buffer and likely amplifying perceived stress.
- Physiologic indicators consistent with nocturnal arousal/delayed downregulation (evening/night HR deviations that correlate moderately with PSS), and circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability elevated), which align with the above self-report risk signals.
- Fewer or weaker protective features (some preservation of interpersonal functioning and low substance use), so multiple strong risk indicators are largely unoffset.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean of 21.59)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 21; Z ≈ 0.8) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z ≈ 0.86), both positively correlated with PSS.
- Mild-to-moderate subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and objective indicators of circadian/structure disruption (intradaily variability Z ≈ 1.09; reduced 24‑h autocorrelation Z ≈ −0.53; sleep timing variability), which are associated with higher PSS.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29), a trait that modestly relates to greater perceived stress in the sample.
- Some objective shortness of sleep (median ~6 h 46 min; Z ≈ −0.52), which can contribute to higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Magnitude/severity of risk indicators: Participant 1 shows multiple large-magnitude signals (many Zs around ±2 or greater: severe anxiety, emotional lability, pain/interference, very low self-efficacy) and extreme objective sleep restriction. Participant 2’s symptom and circadian Z-scores are generally more modest (mostly ~0.8–1.1 range) rather than extreme.
- Number and strength of protective factors: Participant 2 has several substantial protective factors (regular frequent exercise with high Z, no substance use, relatively low resting HR, above-mean happiness) that are known to mitigate perceived stress. Participant 1 has fewer and weaker protective signals (low substance use and preserved interpersonal functioning, modestly low resting HR).
- Consilience of modalities: Participant 1’s self-report and wearable data converge on a high-stress pattern (severe anxiety + objective severe sleep disruption + circadian fragmentation). Participant 2’s risk signals are coherent but milder and counterbalanced by strong health behaviors and physiological resilience.
- Population mean context: both individuals are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the magnitudes of deviation from their sample norms and the extremity of objective indicators favor a larger elevation for Participant 1.

Overall judgement
- The balance of evidence (magnitude of symptom Z-scores, extreme objective sleep restriction and circadian disruption, and fewer protective factors) indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS relative to their study population.

- Severe self-reported anxiety (GAD-7 = 16; z = 1.16), a strong positive correlate of PSS in this sample.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15) and extremely short median wearable sleep duration (~2 h 58 m; z = -0.82), both strongly linked to higher PSS.
- Markers of emotional dysregulation and pain interference (BASIS-24 emotional lability z = 1.23; PEG-3 z = 1.18) that correlate positively with PSS.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55), a strong negative correlate of PSS (i.e., low coping resources → higher perceived stress).
- Objective circadian/sleep disruption: late median sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low amplitude and low 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.4), consistent with chronic stress-related rhythm disruption.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal (multiple overnight HR deviations with positive z-scores and positive correlations with PSS).
- Multiple convergent signals (self-report + wearable physiology) point to above-mean perceived stress for Participant 1.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D z = 0.8; STAI z = 0.86), both positively correlated with PSS.
- Lower self‑esteem (RSES z = -1.29), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Some sleep/circadian risk markers: modestly short sleep (6 h 46 m; z = -0.52), nontrivial sleep timing variability (SD ≈ 99 min), elevated intradaily variability (z = 1.09), and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (z = -0.53); these relate to higher PSS.
- Overall the self-report symptom cluster and circadian fragmentation support an inference of above-mean PSS (but described as a moderate elevation).

Comparative weighing of evidence
- Severity and convergence: Participant 1 shows more extreme and convergent indicators of stress (severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, extremely short objective sleep, marked nocturnal HR elevations, multiple z-scores > |1.2|), whereas Participant 2’s risk indicators are moderate (CES‑D/STAI z ≈ 0.8, circadian fragmentation z ≈ 1.09) and accompanied by substantial protective factors.
- Protective/mitigating factors: Participant 2 has strong protective behaviors and physiology (frequent exercise, no substance use, low resting HR, higher self-reported happiness) that likely mitigate perceived stress; Participant 1 has fewer mitigating signals and more direct physiological corroboration of nocturnal arousal.
- Likely magnitude: Both participants are described as above their respective sample means, but Participant 1’s deviations from sample norms are larger and more pathological (especially sleep disruption and nocturnal autonomic arousal), implying a higher absolute elevation in perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 2 has relative to theirs.

10,64296,10,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Some behavioral risk indicators: slightly short median sleep (Z ≈ -0.4) and late habitual sleep onset (~01:07) — these can be associated with poorer recovery and higher perceived stress.
- Minimal solo exercise and very limited social time (social time Z substantially negative) — reduced behavioral buffers against stress.
- Although physiological circadian markers (large amplitude, high interdaily stability) and low resting HR point toward lower stress, their correlations with PSS in this dataset are modest (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.16), so these objective strengths provide only limited protection against elevated PSS if other psychosocial factors were present.
- Net effect: while many indicators point below mean, the weaker strength of the most relevant correlations and the presence of modest behavioral stressors leave more residual uncertainty that P1 could be nearer the sample mean or somewhat higher than a very low-stress profile.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42), so this is a plausible contributor to elevated perceived stress for this participant.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations that are modestly positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31) — these provide additional, but relatively small, signals toward higher stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and direction of the strongest indicators favor Participant 2 as having lower stress relative to their cohort. Participant 2 shows very large, highly relevant effects: extreme high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.79) and very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -1.38), where these scales have strong correlations with PSS in that study (NGSE r ≈ -0.60; GAD r ≈ +0.75). Participant 2 also has very low resting HR (Z ≈ -2.23) and large positive circadian stability/amplitude Zs (+1.84, +1.89) — all of these are consistent with substantially lower PSS and have relatively large effect sizes or correlations.
- Participant 1 also shows multiple indicators of lower stress (low CES‑D, lower trait anxiety, high momentary happiness, large HR amplitude Z ≈ +2.7, interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.41), but the psychometric measures most predictive of PSS in that study are weaker (e.g., STAI Z only -0.62; CES‑D Z -1.07) and the physiological–PSS correlations reported are smaller (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.16, interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11). In other words, P1’s favorable signals are real but, in this dataset, less strongly tied to PSS than P2’s strongest signals.
- The principal countervailing signal for P2 (PSQI sleep disturbance) is moderate in correlation magnitude (r ≈ 0.42) and appears isolated against many strong low‑stress indicators. For P1, behavioral downsides (late/short sleep, low social/exercise) are present and weaken confidence that P1 is far below the cohort mean.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Both participants are described as likely below their respective population means. However, Participant 2’s profile contains multiple, large-magnitude indicators that are strongly correlated with lower PSS (especially very low GAD-7 and very high NGSE), making P2 relatively more convincingly low in perceived stress.
- Participant 1, while overall below mean, has weaker predictive psychometric signals and some behavioral risk factors that leave P1 closer to the mean (or less extremely low) than P2.
- Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher PSS (i.e., worse perceived stress) when comparing the two within their respective-study frames.

- Elevated tonic physiological activation: resting heart rate (RHR Z = 0.86) and MESOR (Z = 0.61) are above the sample mean, and these variables correlate positively (albeit modestly) with PSS in the study.  
- Greater within-day fragmentation: intradaily variability above average (Z ≈ 0.53) which correlates positively with PSS.  
- Sleep timing and duration: relatively late median sleep start (~01:32) and somewhat short median sleep duration (6 h 48 min, Z = -0.47) — patterns often associated with higher stress.  
- Lower momentary positive affect: current happiness below the sample mean (Z = -0.53), which relates to higher PSS.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS
- Strong self-report drivers of PSS: elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 8) and high emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63); these measures have very strong correlations with PSS in the dataset (GAD r ≈ 0.77; BASIS-24 r ≈ 0.66).  
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep) and PSQI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- Objective sleep disruption: extremely short median nightly sleep (median 1 h 39 min, Z = -1.27), very late sleep onset (~04:36 AM), and naps present — objective signs consistent with severe sleep-related stress/fragmentation (noting possible measurement artifact caveat stated in the summary).  
- Physiological/circadian indices of dysregulation: high RHR (Z = 1.19) and MESOR (Z = 1.24), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z = -1.05), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.07), low interdaily stability — a pattern of blunted day–night rhythm and nocturnal/early-morning HR elevations that align with elevated perceived stress.  
- Pain/interference: elevated PEG-3 and PAPAS associations with PSS suggest pain-related distress contributes to perceived stress.  
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44), which is negatively correlated with PSS, further supporting greater perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Participant 1 is characterized explicitly as near the population mean PSS (21.61) and, when psychosocial buffers are weighted, slightly below mean. Their strongest indicators of higher stress are moderate physiological activations and later/shorter sleep, but these are counterbalanced by relatively strong psychosocial buffers (higher self-esteem, low depressive symptoms, good subjective sleep quality, high circadian regularity, good academic functioning). Overall the evidence for elevated PSS is modest and mixed.  
- Participant 2 is characterized explicitly as likely above their population mean PSS (21.08). Multiple independent, strongly PSS-correlated self-report measures (anxiety, emotional lability, disturbed sleep) are elevated, and objective wearable data show pronounced physiological and circadian dysregulation (high RHR/MESOR, reduced amplitude, intradaily fragmentation, early-morning HR elevation) plus extremely short/late objective sleep. Although some mitigating signals exist (anxiety is mild; possible wearable artifact for sleep), the convergence of strong self-report correlates and multiple dysregulated wearable metrics gives coherent, multi-modal evidence for elevated perceived stress relative to their peers.

Final judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population) than Participant 1.

- Strength and number of risk signals: Participant 2 presents multiple, moderately-to-strongly predictive indicators of higher PSS (PSQI = 13, GAD‑7 with very high sample correlation to PSS, pain interference, large sleep variability, circadian irregularity). Participant 1’s primary risk signals are sleep/circadian disruption, but these are counterbalanced by several strong protective factors (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR).
- Relative magnitude: Participant 2’s subjective sleep problems are worse (PSQI 13 vs 10), sleep variability is much larger (z ≈ +1.7) and anxiety, while mild, is more salient given its strong sample correlation with PSS. Participant 1’s protective profile (notably low depression/anxiety and low resting HR with sizable negative Zs) makes it less likely they are above their sample mean.

- Behavioral risk factors: very high sedentary/screen time (video games, TV, internet) and very low exercise frequency — these reduce known behavioral stress buffers and can be associated with higher perceived stress.
- Social/interpersonal risk: low social-trust score (Z = -2.39) could reflect reduced perceived social support or interpersonal strain, which can elevate perceived stress.
- Sleep timing and tonic arousal: late median sleep onset (~01:04 AM) and modestly elevated heart-rate mesor/amplitude (resting HR and HR mesor Z > 0) could reflect some evening/tonic physiological activation associated with higher PSS.
- Taken within-sample: while these signals are present, their sample-level correlations with PSS are modest and they are described as smaller/more localized compared with stronger protective signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Severe sleep disturbance: very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5) and objectively very short median sleep (~3.5 h) with very late sleep onset (~03:37 AM). Both sleep quality and very short sleep show moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Pain/interference: elevated pain scores (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) that correlate moderately (~0.5) with PSS and can drive higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian attenuation: nighttime heart-rate elevations (notably 11 PM–2 AM) and reduced circadian amplitude/24-h autocorrelation — these physiologic abnormalities have moderate correlations with PSS and align with the participant’s disturbed sleep.
- Taken within-sample: these are relatively large, concordant risk signals that the summary explicitly states outweigh protective factors, leading to an “above mean” inference.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is referenced to its own study population mean (P1 mean 21.64; P2 mean 21.21). Participant 1 is inferred to be below their population mean (likely near the lower quartile) because of very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem/happiness, strong sleep regularity, and robust circadian metrics — several of which have meaningful negative correlations with PSS. The risk signals for P1 (sedentary behavior, late sleep timing, modestly elevated HR) are smaller in magnitude and have weaker sample correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2 is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean because multiple strong, concordant indicators with moderate-to-strong sample correlations to PSS are elevated (clinically disturbed subjective sleep, extremely short objective sleep, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations, attenuated circadian robustness). Protective signals for P2 (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) are meaningful but described as insufficient to outweigh the strong sleep/pain/arousal cluster.
- Comparing the strength and number of risk vs protective signals across participants: P1’s dominant signals are protective and strongly tied to lower PSS (very low CES-D and STAI-Trait; strong circadian stability). P2’s dominant signals are risk factors that are large in magnitude and have moderate-to-strong associations with PSS (sleep disruption, extreme sleep restriction, pain, nocturnal arousal).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows multiple large, convergent risk indicators that are strongly linked to higher perceived stress in their cohort and are judged to place them above their population mean.
- Participant 1 shows multiple strong protective indicators and only modest/smaller risk signals, and is judged to be below their population mean.
- Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to have the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress) relative to their respective study populations.

  - Some circadian metrics not maximally rigid (24‑h autocorr z = -0.28; interdaily stability z = 0.17).
  - Very large evening HR deviation (5–6 PM z ≈ 4.19) — could reflect late‑day strenuous activity (likely exercise) but in some contexts could interfere with evening wind‑down and modestly associate with stress.

Participant 1’s description explicitly concludes they are likely slightly above their population mean (21.04), driven by high‑weight predictors (anxiety and poor subjective sleep) plus objective circadian irregularity. Although protective factors exist, the strongest correlates push P1 above the mean.
- Participant 2’s description concludes they are below their population mean (21.63), with multiple strong, concordant protective indicators (very low depression/anxiety, good sleep, stable routines, low resting HR, regular exercise). The features that could raise P2’s PSS are modest in magnitude and are plausibly explained by healthy behaviors (exercise) rather than pathology.
- Relative strength of evidence: P1 shows several moderate‑to‑strong positive predictors of higher PSS (including one predictor with very high correlation to PSS: GAD‑7), whereas P2 shows strong, multiple indicators pointing to lower PSS and only small circadian/wearable signals that might modestly increase stress.

Conclusion
Given the within‑sample frames and the balance of evidence, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit higher perceived stress than Participant 2.

10,92412,10,16,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI–PSS correlation moderate (r ≈ 0.42). This is the clearest countervailing signal.
- Nocturnal HR deviations: early-morning hourly HR values with larger negative deviations (Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), suggesting some night-time cardiovascular features could modestly track higher PSS.
- The discrepancy between adequate objective sleep duration and poor subjective sleep quality can itself be associated with distress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated intradaily variability (0.66; Z = 0.81), which has a modest positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17) and indicates greater rest–activity fragmentation that is linked to higher stress.
- Elevated evening heart rate (very large deviation at 5–6 PM, Z = +4.19); while plausibly explained by regular strenuous exercise, sustained evening physiological arousal can interfere with wind-down and shows small sample correlations with stress for some hours.
- Small positive correlations between some nighttime-to-morning HR deviations and PSS also present for this participant.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are characterized in their respective studies as most-consistently below the population mean PSS. Neither profile strongly suggests above-mean PSS.
- Strength and number of protective vs. risk signals differ:
  - Participant 1 shows very strong protective indicators relative to their sample: maximal NGSE (Z ≈ +1.79, NGSE–PSS r = -0.60), very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -1.38, GAD–PSS r = +0.75), exceptionally low interpersonal distress (Z ≈ -2.47), and very low resting HR (Z ≈ -2.23). These large-magnitude signals (and their strong correlations with PSS) strongly favor well-below-mean perceived stress.
  - Participant 1’s main risk signal is a clinically notable PSQI = 7 and some modest nocturnal HR–PSS associations; those risk signals are moderate in magnitude and fewer in number than the protective signals.
  - Participant 2 also has multiple protective indicators (low CES-D and STAI, good PSQI, high happiness, regular exercise, sleep regularity, low RHR), but these protections are generally less extreme in Z-score magnitude than Participant 1’s strongest protections. Participant 2’s risk signals (intradaily variability, evening HR elevation) are small-to-moderate and partly plausibly explained by healthy behavior (exercise).
- Thus, although both participants are likely below their study mean PSS, Participant 1’s profile contains stronger and more extreme indicators tied to lower PSS, while Participant 2 shows slightly more (albeit modest) indicators that could elevate PSS relative to their population.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 is more likely to have the higher PSS (i.e., worse perceived stress) relative to their cohort than Participant 1 is relative to theirs. Both are probably below their respective study means, but the balance of evidence suggests Participant 2 is closer to the mean / has more small risk signals, whereas Participant 1’s extreme protective scores make them likely further below the mean.

22,17932,10,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83) — PSQI correlates moderately-to-strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a meaningful upward predictor.  
- Wearable sleep metrics consistent with severe nocturnal disruption (median sleep 1 hr 44 min, high sleep-start variability), which aligns with the PSQI and would tend to raise perceived stress.  
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 ≈ 7.78, Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.8), both moderately positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).  
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate deviations suggesting night‑time arousal (midnight–early morning positive HR deviations) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Although there are strong protective signals (very low GAD-7, high self‑efficacy, robust circadian metrics), the combination of subjective sleep problems + pain provides a substantive, focused upward push on inferred PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13; Z = +2.9) — described as the strongest single signal likely to increase perceived stress. The PSQI Z is large relative to that study’s distribution.  
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:24 AM) and some evening HR elevations that could reflect evening hyperarousal or poor sleep timing, both plausibly associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Slightly lower self‑rated happiness and reduced social‑trust (small-to-moderate negative contextual factors).  
- However, many strong objective and trait indicators point in the opposite direction (low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, very low resting HR, robust circadian stability, regular exercise, long objective sleep duration), so the PSQI appears to be a specific, isolated risk rather than part of a broader high‑stress profile.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participant profiles are written relative to very similar population PSS means (P1 mean 21.50; P2 mean 21.62), so the base rates are comparable.  
- Magnitude of sleep complaint: Participant 2’s PSQI is more extreme within their sample (Z ≈ +2.9) than Participant 1’s PSQI (Z ≈ +0.83) — so, on that single dimension, Participant 2 shows a larger within‑sample deviation. That said, the two participants differ on other risk domains.  
- Additional risk load: Participant 1 has not only elevated PSQI but also corroborating wearable indicators of very short/fragmented sleep and elevated pain/interference scores (two additional, moderately correlated contributors to PSS). Participant 2’s very high PSQI is less corroborated by other risk signals (objective sleep duration is long, trait anxiety and depression are low, exercise and functioning are strong).  
- Protective signals: Both participants have strong protective indicators (low anxiety/negative affect and robust circadian/cardiac markers). Participant 1’s protective signals are pronounced (GAD‑7 Z ≈ -1.2, NGSE modestly positive, good interpersonal functioning), and Participant 2 also shows strong objective protection (low RHR Z ≈ -1.13, interdaily stability and autocorrelation Zs strongly positive, exercise Z ≈ +1.07). Overall, however, Participant 1’s risk indicators are multiple (sleep + pain + nocturnal arousal) while Participant 2’s main risk is concentrated primarily in subjective sleep.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 has a larger single‑variable deviation on sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ +2.9), but that appears relatively isolated and contradicted by a suite of objective and trait markers indicating lower chronic stress.  
- Participant 1 shows several converging upward signals (subjective sleep disturbance supported by problematic wearable sleep metrics, plus elevated pain/interference) that together provide a multi‑domain push toward higher perceived stress, even though strong protective traits temper the overall elevation.  
- Both summaries explicitly conclude Participant 1 is near the sample mean with a modest upward tilt, whereas Participant 2 is near or slightly below the mean. Taking those within‑sample inferences and the pattern of convergent risk signals into account, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall PSS.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), a self-report metric that correlates with higher PSS and commonly amplifies daily stress reports.
- Late median sleep start (~01:26 AM) and modestly elevated nap rate (0.18 naps/day), which in this sample weakly correlate with higher PSS.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (peak deviation at ~6–7 PM, Z ≈ 2.62), which can reflect sustained evening arousal and has modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.20), a personal appraisal that can contribute to higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 8) and very strong correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77) — a major predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13; r ≈ 0.49 with PSS).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63; r ≈ 0.66), strongly associated with higher PSS.
- Pain/interference (PEG-3) contributing to distress (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).
- Physiological indicators of hyperarousal and circadian dysregulation: elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.2), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ -1.05), low interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability—patterns that in this sample align with higher PSS.
- Pronounced early-morning heart-rate deviations (1–8 AM) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).
- Extremely short median nightly sleep recorded by wearable (median ~1 h 39 min, Z ≈ -1.27) and very late sleep onset (~04:36 AM) plus naps (0.4/day, Z ≈ 1.24), consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and higher stress (with caveat that this metric might reflect recording/wear artifacts).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is reported relative to its own study mean. Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes their features are more consistent with a PSS below that study’s mean (21.63); their strongest signals are low depressive and anxiety symptomatology, high self‑esteem/happiness, robust circadian amplitude, and low resting HR — all robust indicators tied to lower PSS in that sample. The few stress-aligned features (PSQI, late timing, evening HR) are weaker and fewer.
- Participant 2’s summary explicitly concludes their features are consistent with PSS above that study’s mean (21.08); they present multiple, independent, and strongly correlated predictors of higher PSS (notably anxiety, emotional lability, poor sleep) plus wearable-derived physiological and circadian patterns that align with elevated stress. Several of these predictors have strong correlations with PSS in that dataset (e.g., GAD r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; self-efficacy r ≈ -0.65), giving the inference greater weight.
- Mitigating points: Participant 1 has some indicators that could push stress upward but these are modest; Participant 2 has a caveat that some wearable metrics could be artifacts (very short sleep) and their anxiety is in the mild (not severe) range — however the convergence of multiple high-correlation self-report measures plus physiological dysregulation still points toward higher PSS.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows more and stronger indicators of elevated perceived stress (multiple high-correlation self-report measures and corroborating physiological/circadian dysregulation) relative to their population mean.
- Participant 1 shows stronger and more numerous indicators of lower perceived stress relative to their population mean, with only modest counter-evidence.

These map to variables that are strongly or moderately correlated with PSS in this sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71; PSQI r ≈ 0.41).
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.49) plus objective evidence of extreme sleep loss (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min, very high night-to-night variability). The objective short sleep and nocturnal HR deviations (early-night +6.6 bpm, correlations r ≈ 0.48–0.51) indicate physiologic arousal at night, which in this sample relates to higher PSS.
- Circadian fragmentation (elevated intradaily variability Z ≈ 1.15) and dampened HR rhythm (amplitude/mesor Zs ≈ -0.9, -1.14) that are consistent with deconsolidated daily structure often seen with higher perceived stress.
- Although there are some protective features (low substance use, decent interpersonal functioning, low resting HR possibly from fitness), they are fewer and smaller in magnitude than the strong risk signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean of 21.59)
- High depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 2.05) and pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 3.83), both of which are positively associated with PSS in this sample and are salient contributors to above-mean perceived stress.
- Modest physiological signs consistent with stress: mildly elevated resting HR (Z = 0.65) and increased intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.81), indicating some circadian fragmentation/arousal.
- Lower happiness and below-average self-esteem add additional psychological risk signals.
- However, there are notable mitigating features (longer-than-average objective sleep duration Z = 1.22 with low night-to-night variability, regular exercise Z = 1.07, moderate social time Z = 0.95, minimal substance use) that are plausible buffers and may attenuate perceived stress despite high subjective disturbance.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Severity and breadth of risk signals: Participant 1 shows numerous high-magnitude risk indicators across affective (severe anxiety), sleep (extreme objective short sleep + subjective disturbance), pain, emotion regulation, and self-efficacy domains — several with Zs ≳ 2. Participant 2 has two very salient signals (CES-D Z ≈ 2.05 and PSQI Z ≈ 3.83) but otherwise more moderate Zs and several protective behaviors.
- Objective sleep profiles diverge markedly: Participant 1 has extreme objective sleep restriction (large adverse effect on stress-related physiology), whereas Participant 2 paradoxically reports very poor subjective sleep but has objectively long, stable sleep — a potential resilience factor that can lower perceived stress or at least mitigate its intensity.
- Correlations to PSS in each sample: In Participant 1’s description, key risk measures (anxiety, PSQI, pain) have relatively strong correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71), whereas some of Participant 2’s risk measures have weaker sample correlations (STAI r ≈ 0.31, others ~0.15). Thus the same Z-magnitude may translate to a larger impact on PSS for Participant 1.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s multiple, high-magnitude, convergent risk indicators (especially severe anxiety + objective extreme sleep loss + low self-efficacy + pain) outweigh their limited protective features. Participant 2 has strong subjective signals but also substantial objective/behavioral protective factors that temper the overall stress burden.

Weighted judgment
- Considering number, magnitude, and relevance (to PSS) of indicators within each participant’s population frame, Participant 1’s profile is more consistent with a higher perceived stress level relative to their study mean than Participant 2’s profile is relative to theirs.

- Elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3 z = 1.18), emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z = 1.23, r with PSS ≈ 0.65), and low self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55, r = -0.66)—variables strongly linked to higher PSS in this sample.
- Circadian disruption: reduced amplitude, high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low interdaily stability and very low 24‑hr autocorrelation—all consistent with flattened/irregular rhythms associated with chronic stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes PSS is above the study mean (population mean PSS = 20.92, SD = 7.51), supported by convergent self‑report and wearable evidence.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective study means. The critical comparison is severity and strength of predictors relative to each sample.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are high depressive symptoms and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = 3.83). However, several protective/mitigating factors are present (long objective sleep duration Z = 1.22, low night‑to‑night objective variability, regular exercise Z = 1.07, social time Z = 0.95, low substance use) and the reported correlations of the key affective measures with PSS are modest (r ≈ 0.27–0.31).
- Participant 2 shows multiple, highly convergent and strongly PSS‑related indicators: severe anxiety (GAD‑7) with a very large correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); marked objective sleep deprivation/late timing and nocturnal HR elevations that are themselves correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40); low self‑efficacy and emotional lability with strong sample correlations to PSS (|r| ≈ 0.65). Protective signals for Participant 2 are weaker and mostly limited to lower baseline daytime HR (not strongly related to PSS) and occasional daytime low HR periods—these do not mitigate the clear pattern of nocturnal hyperarousal, severe anxiety, and disrupted circadian physiology.

Overall balance of evidence
- Although both participants are above their respective population means, Participant 2’s profile shows more severe, multimodal, and more strongly PSS‑linked indicators (severe anxiety with very high PSS correlation, extreme objective sleep loss and late timing, nocturnal HR elevations correlated with PSS, low self‑efficacy and emotional lability with strong correlations). Participant 1 has important risk signals (notably depressive symptoms and very poor subjective sleep) but also substantive behavioral/physiological buffers and generally weaker predictor correlations.
- Therefore, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS score) relative to their respective study populations.

20,64232,21,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean = 21.04)
- Strongly elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10), noted as clinically meaningful; in this cohort GAD-7 correlates very highly with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), making this a powerful predictor of above-mean PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5) and objectively short median sleep duration (~3 h 55 min). PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS (≈ 0.49) and short/fragmented sleep is mechanistically linked to higher stress.
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86), with moderate correlations to PSS (~0.45–0.49), which typically accompany elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9) with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Wearable circadian signals (reduced HR amplitude, low interdaily stability) and flattened/shifted diurnal heart-rate deviations that modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Although some protective markers exist (high self-efficacy, low interpersonal difficulties, lower resting HR), the most predictive elevated measures (anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability) are both severe and have relatively large cohort correlations with PSS, supporting an above-mean PSS inference.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.6)
- Moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8; Z = 0.59). Both are positively associated with PSS in this dataset.
- Markedly low interdaily stability (Z = −1.56) and large variability in sleep timing (sleep-start SD Z = 1.48), behavioral/circadian patterns commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Reduced momentary happiness and slightly lower self-esteem, which align with higher stress.
- Some wearable signs (evening/night HR deviations, modestly elevated MESOR) suggesting somewhat elevated cardiovascular tone.
- However, many of these signals are moderate in magnitude and their correlations with PSS are described as modest.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Strength and specificity of predictors: Participant 1’s elevated measures (GAD-7, PSQI, pain measures, emotional lability) are both more extreme and are explicitly reported to have stronger correlations with PSS in that cohort (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77, BASIS-24 emotional lability r ≈ 0.66). Participant 2’s strongest risk signals (STAI, PSQI, interdaily stability) are more moderate in effect size and often have only modest correlations with PSS.
- Severity and consistency across domains: Participant 1 shows severe subjective sleep restriction (very short objective sleep) plus high anxiety, pain, and lability — a multi-domain cluster of high-risk signs. Participant 2 has mixed evidence: notable circadian irregularity but also protective, stress-limiting factors (long nightly sleep, frequent sports, normal depression score, typical resting HR).
- Protective factors: Participant 1’s protective factors (high self-efficacy, lower interpersonal problems, lower resting HR) attenuate risk but do not outweigh multiple strong risk indicators. Participant 2’s protective factors are stronger and more numerous (adequate sleep duration, regular exercise, low depressive symptoms), making their above-mean inference more modest.
- Population means are very similar (21.04 vs 21.6), so absolute mean differences do not meaningfully affect the comparison; focus should be on within-cohort signal strength and severity.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Overall, Participant 1 presents more and stronger predictors of elevated perceived stress (clinically meaningful anxiety, very poor sleep quantity and quality, pain interference, emotional lability), with several of these measures having large correlations with PSS in that cohort.
- Participant 2 likely is above their population mean but to a milder degree: risk signals are present (circadian irregularity, PSQI, STAI) but balanced by substantial protective factors (adequate total sleep time, exercise, normal depressive symptoms).

Final determination
- Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

14,70125,24,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Clinically meaningful elevations in mood symptoms: CES‑D = 24 (Z ≈ 1.11; classified as “Depressed”) and STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86; “anxious”), both of which correlate positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Marked sleep disturbance and irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), very late median sleep onset (~01:44), and high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 1.32). Sleep disturbance/variability correlate positively (though modestly) with PSS in the sample.  
- Reduced circadian regularity: multiple HR‑based circadian metrics are below average (interdaily stability, amplitude, 24‑h autocorrelation; Zs around -0.5 to -0.7), a pattern that associates empirically and conceptually with higher stress.  
- Low social trust and lower health satisfaction (Zs ≈ -1.74 and -0.95), which can increase stress vulnerability in context.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong anxiety and emotional‑dysregulation signals: GAD‑7 = 10.5 (at clinical screening threshold) and elevated BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability (Z ≈ 0.53). Crucially, these measures have very strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.65).  
- Disturbed subjective sleep and pain interference: PSQI = 8.5 (disturbed sleep; PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.55) and elevated PEG‑3 / PAPAS (pain/interference; r ≈ 0.43–0.47), all of which are meaningfully associated with higher PSS.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive HR deviations around midnight–2am (Zs ≈ 1.25–1.36) that correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), indicating nocturnal cardiovascular activation paralleling higher subjective stress.  
- Substantial night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 0.65), which can exacerbate stress.

Comparative, within‑study framing and weighing of evidence
- Both participants are described as having profiles consistent with PSS above their respective study means. The key analytic question is which participant’s pattern indicates relatively worse perceived stress within their sample.  
- Strength of associations to PSS: Participant 2’s principal predictors (GAD‑7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain measures, nocturnal HR) have substantially larger reported correlations with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.77, 0.65, 0.55, 0.4) than Participant 1’s strongest predictors (CES‑D/STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31; sleep variability r ≈ 0.13). This suggests that equivalent elevations on Participant 2’s measures are more tightly linked to higher PSS in that study.  
- Magnitude and clinical thresholds: Participant 1 shows clinically relevant depressive symptoms and meaningful sleep/circadian disruption; Participant 2 meets a clinical anxiety screening threshold, has higher PSQI, notable pain interference, and large nocturnal HR deviations — a cluster of high‑impact indicators across survey and physiology.  
- Protective factors: Both participants have protective features, but Participant 1 has high self‑esteem and frequent exercise that appear to partially buffer stress; Participant 2 has higher self‑efficacy and robust circadian rhythm metrics that are protective. The protective signals seem stronger in Participant 2 for circadian regularity (positive Zs ≈ 0.6–1.0) but do not eliminate the strong anxiety/pain/nocturnal‑arousal signals.  
- Variability of the population SDs: Participant 1’s study SD for PSS is smaller (SD ≈ 3.66) than Participant 2’s (SD ≈ 7.51), which can affect how a given absolute score maps to z‑scores; however, the descriptions emphasize effect sizes and correlations within each sample rather than exact PSS values, and Participant 2’s predictors are more strongly tied to PSS in that sample regardless of SD differences.

Overall judgment
- Taking into account the relative strengths of the predictors and their correlations with PSS within each participant’s study sample, Participant 2’s profile (clinically meaningful anxiety strongly correlated with PSS, elevated PSQI and pain scores also strongly correlated with PSS, and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations linked to PSS) constitutes a stronger overall signal of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1’s mixed profile, where the strongest predictors have more modest correlations with PSS and several protective resources are present.

- Strong, directly stress-related self-report signals: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z = +2.04; GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS, r ≈ 0.71) and very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 18, Z ≈ +1.49; PSQI r ≈ 0.41).
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 = 10; PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28) and high emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42), both of which tend to co-occur with and elevate perceived stress.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29), which is negatively correlated with PSS and would amplify perceived stress in coping situations.
- Objective wearable corroboration of severe sleep restriction and circadian disruption: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min with very high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min), low interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability—patterns known to increase perceived stress.
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations consistent with elevated physiological arousal at sleep onset (late-evening/early-night positive deviations that correlate moderately with PSS), supporting the self-report anxiety/insomnia picture.
- Although there are some protective features (low substance-use problems, relatively preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR possibly due to fitness), the number and magnitude of high-Z stress indicators outweigh those buffers.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their population mean = 21.59)
- Wearable-derived circadian/physiologic markers suggesting dysregulation: reduced interdaily stability (0.30, Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -1.52), slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These objective features have modest positive associations with PSS in the sample.
- Shorter and somewhat variable objective sleep (median ≈ 6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33; sleep variability SD Z ≈ +0.94), which correlates with higher PSS (though correlations are smaller than for anxiety measures).
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV Z ≈ +2.54) which is weakly associated with greater PSS in this dataset.
- Large positive early-morning heart-rate deviations (5–7 AM outliers) that are physiologically atypical and could reflect early awakenings or habitual early activity—potentially an indicator of sleep disturbance or stress-related arousal (interpretation uncertain).

Comparative/within-population reasoning and weighting of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple high-magnitude signals that are strongly and directly predictive of perceived stress in their sample (severe anxiety with strong correlation to PSS; very poor subjective sleep with moderate correlation; elevated pain and emotional lability with high Z-scores). Objective wearables strongly corroborate severe sleep restriction and circadian fragmentation. The convergence across high-Z self-report measures and objective physiology strongly favors higher-than-mean PSS for this participant.
- Participant 2: the strongest and most directly stress-predictive measures (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, happiness/health satisfaction) are favorable (low anxiety, high well-being) and point toward lower PSS relative to their population mean. Objective disturbances (blunted amplitude, lower interdaily stability, shorter sleep) do point toward higher PSS but their associations with PSS are weaker in this sample than Participant 1’s strong self-report signals. Some wearable anomalies (early-morning HR spikes) are notable but ambiguous (could be exercise or artifact) and are not accompanied by elevated self-reported anxiety or depression.
- Because each profile is framed relative to its own population mean, we compare the strength and directness of stress indicators: Participant 1 shows multiple, large, directly stress-related deviations (severe anxiety, extreme sleep restriction, high pain, emotional lability) that are strongly correlated with PSS in their sample. Participant 2’s objective disturbances are real but of smaller magnitude and are counterbalanced (and arguably outweighed) by robustly favorable self-report indicators that have known correlations with lower PSS in that sample.

Conclusion
- Overall, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) relative to their study population.

14,22455,24,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 20.92)
- Elevated trait anxiety and emotional dysregulation: GAD-7 = 10.5 and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated; these measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD-7 correlation reported ≈ 0.77; BASIS-24 r ≈ 0.65), so they are powerful predictors of higher perceived stress.  
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8.5 (clinically disturbed), moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG-3 mean 8.33 and PAPAS Z = 1.21; pain measures correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large overnight HR deviations (e.g., +13–14 bpm around midnight–2am) that correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), supporting active physiological stress.  
- Sleep timing variability/fragmentation: High night-to-night SD of sleep (199 min, Z ≈ 0.65) which is associated with more stress in this dataset.

Potential countervailing (protective) features for Participant 1 (reduce likelihood of very high PSS)
- Above-average self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.12) and strong circadian regularity measures (interdaily stability, autocorrelation, amplitude) which correlate negatively with PSS.  
- Low resting HR and low substance-use scores (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z ≈ -0.77) consistent with physiological/behavioral resilience.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.59)
- Objective circadian/behavioral disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32); these metrics in this sample are modestly associated with higher PSS.  
- Shorter and more variable sleep: median nightly sleep ~6h7m (Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated sleep-duration SD (Z ≈ +0.94), both linked to higher PSS (small-to-moderate correlations).  
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV/internet use Zs high) which is weakly associated with higher PSS.  
- Atypical early-morning HR spikes (large positive deviations 5–7 AM) that are physiologically atypical and could reflect sleep disruption or early activity; interpretation relative to stress is uncertain.

Potential countervailing (protective) features for Participant 2 (reduce likelihood of high PSS)
- Consistently favorable self-report affect: low trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 28, Z ≈ -1.31), near-mean depressive symptoms, very high self-esteem/happiness/health satisfaction (Rosenberg Z ≈ +1.10; Happiness Z ≈ +1.64; Health satisfaction Z ≈ +1.96). These self-report measures are directly and moderately predictive of lower PSS in this dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.32; CES-D r ≈ 0.29).  
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z ≈ -0.8), low substance use, regular exercise — all supportive of lower perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within the frame of each sample mean
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as having survey-based indicators that are strongly predictive of higher PSS (notably GAD-7 and PSQI), plus corroborating nocturnal HR elevations that themselves correlate substantially with PSS in that sample. Although protective circadian metrics exist, the strongest, most directly stress-related signals point above that population mean (20.92).  
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as below their population mean (21.59) because the strongest predictors of PSS in that sample are self-report affect (trait anxiety, happiness, health satisfaction), and these are strongly weighted toward lower stress. The wearable-derived circadian disruptions and shorter sleep are risk signals but are described as weaker predictors in this sample and plausibly secondary or subclinical. The early-morning HR spikes are unusual but of uncertain stress implication.

Overall balance of evidence
- The strongest, most directly PSS-predictive signals (high trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, pain interference, emotional lability, and nocturnal HR arousal) appear with Participant 1 and are described as closely correlated with PSS in that dataset.  
- Participant 2’s most robust signals are low trait anxiety and high well-being — strong indicators of lower perceived stress — while their objective risk markers are of smaller effect and more ambiguous in relation to current subjective stress.

16,45076,23,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean of 21.6)
- Modest elevations in trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ +0.27) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ +0.18), both of which correlate positively with PSS in that sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, above clinical cutpoint) and late / variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 00:57; night-to-night SD ≈ 63 min) — subjective sleep complaints in this sample associate with higher PSS.
- Reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.74) and mildly increased intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.32), plus some early‑morning HR deviations that correlate positively (r ≈ 0.19–0.21) with PSS — these circadian/physiological signals point toward more arousal/irregularity that can accompany greater perceived stress.
- Lower recent happiness and health satisfaction (small negative z‑scores), which tend to co-occur with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean of 20.96)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 12) and a strong PSQI–PSS relationship in the sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50). Even if some relative z-scores are mixed, the raw PSQI is high and clinically meaningful.
- Prominent emotional lability (BASIS‑24 emotional lability z ≈ +0.53) with a very strong correlation to PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.65) — a high-impact predictor.
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (1–4 AM: +4–10 bpm) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), plus elevated resting HR and mesor (resting HR z ≈ +1.37; mesor z ≈ +1.18) — indicating sustained physiological arousal linked to higher PSS.
- Extremely long median sleep (12 h, z ≈ +2.26) and very large night-to-night sleep variability (SD z ≈ +2.38). Although wearable sleep quantity has weak direct correlations with PSS in the dataset, such large deviations and instability are worrisome and commonly accompany stress/dysregulation.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength of predictors: For Participant 2, several indicators that are both elevated and have strong sample correlations with PSS (emotional lability r ≈ 0.65; PSQI r ≈ 0.50; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.36–0.41) point toward higher perceived stress. For Participant 1, risk indicators (trait anxiety, CES‑D, PSQI) are smaller in magnitude (z ≈ 0.2–0.3) and their correlations with PSS in that sample are weaker (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28).
- Balance of risk vs protection: Participant 1 has several substantial protective factors relative to their population (high self‑esteem z ≈ +1.38, frequent exercise z > +1.0, low substance use, healthy resting HR), which likely offset the modest risk signals and leave their inferred PSS near but only slightly above the population mean. Participant 2 has some protective domains (low pain, intact interpersonal functioning), but the magnitude and relevance of the stress-linked signals (emotional lability, nocturnal arousal, elevated resting HR, extreme sleep irregularity) are larger and more directly tied to PSS in that sample.
- Magnitude of deviations: Participant 2 shows several large z‑scores (resting HR z ≈ +1.37; sleep duration/variability z ≈ +2.26 and +2.38) and pronounced nocturnal HR deviations, whereas Participant 1’s deviations (even those linked to stress) are generally modest.

Overall judgment
- Although both profiles were characterized as “near the sample mean” in their respective reports, the balance of evidence (stronger, higher-magnitude stress-related signals and stronger sample correlations for those signals) indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their study population.

25,69057,21,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z = +1.16). Trait anxiety has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), so this is a meaningful risk signal.
- Short objective sleep (median ≈ 5 h 35 min; Z = −1.99) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7), both commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z = −0.74; intradaily variability Z = +0.39) and late sleep timing/late evening HR acrophase (evening HR peak Z = +1.79), consistent with delayed timing and elevated evening activation that can accompany greater stress.
- Contextual stressor: academic decline (GPA drop), lower self-rated health satisfaction, reduced happiness, and modestly reduced self-esteem — all factors that plausibly increase perceived stress.

Mitigating features (reduce likelihood/severity of higher PSS)
- Low resting HR and low HR mesor (Z = −1.73, −2.19), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness or low baseline arousal.
- Frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), low substance use, normal-to-low depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ −0.14), and evidence of nocturnal physiological down-regulation during some nights. These are protective against high perceived stress.
- Overall synthesis in the provided report: interpreted as modestly above the population mean (study mean PSS = 21.6), but tempered by protective factors.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6) where GAD‑7 is very strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (r = 0.78). This is a high-weight predictor.
- Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13), a moderately strong predictor of PSS in the sample (r = 0.49).
- Pain-related interference (PEG‑3 ≈ 6.78, r ≈ 0.44) and PAPAS (r ≈ 0.48), both positively correlated with PSS and indicating functional burden.
- Substantial objective sleep irregularity: high night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD z = 1.7) and low interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.68), patterns associated with higher stress.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = +0.54).

Mitigating features (reduce likelihood/severity of higher PSS)
- Moderately high self-efficacy (NGSE z = +0.3) with a strong negative correlation with PSS in that sample (r = −0.65), a potent protective factor.
- No substance problems (BASIS‑24 substance z = −1.62), low emotional lability, and normal resting HR.
- Overall synthesis in the provided report: inferred as slightly above the population mean (study mean PSS = 21.04), with important protective factors but several strong risk indicators.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both profiles are judged by their respective reports to be at or modestly above their population means. We must therefore compare the strength and characteristics of risk versus protective signals within each participant’s own sample frame.
- Key difference in predictor strengths: Participant 2’s most influential positive predictors (GAD‑7 and PSQI) have much larger sample correlations with PSS (r = 0.78 and r = 0.49) than Participant 1’s strongest predictor (STAI r ≈ 0.31). In other words, the variables that are elevated in Participant 2 are more strongly tied to PSS in that dataset.
- Magnitude and severity of symptoms: Participant 2 shows a very high PSQI (13) and substantial pain interference plus very large sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.7). Participant 1 shows very short objective sleep (Z ≈ −1.99) and some circadian irregularity, but also clear protective physiological and behavioral markers (very low resting HR/mesor and frequent exercise).
- Protective factors: Participant 1 presents stronger behavioral/physiological protective signals (low resting HR/mesor, frequent exercise) that likely blunt perceived stress. Participant 2 has a strong psychological buffer (self-efficacy), but its z-score is modest (z = +0.3) even though its correlation with PSS is high.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s elevated features are meaningful but of smaller predictive weight in-sample and are partially offset by strong fitness/exercise indicators. Participant 2’s elevated features include multiple variables that are both severe (PSQI = 13, high sleep variability, pain) and more strongly correlated with PSS in that study, producing a heavier weighted signal toward higher perceived stress despite some protective self-efficacy.

Conclusion (which participant likely exhibits higher PSS)
- Based on the within-sample predictive weights and the magnitude of risk indicators, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

20,21793,21,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Sleep/circadian dysregulation: Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05), short median nightly sleep (6 h 9 min; Z ≈ −1.29), very late median sleep start (~03:36 AM) and elevated sleep-start variability (Z ≈ +1.04). These features are linked to higher PSS in this cohort (modest correlations r ≈ 0.12–0.16).
- High nap frequency: Mean daily naps 0.33 (Z ≈ +3.05), strongly atypical within-sample behavior that co-occurs with nocturnal sleep disturbance and weakly correlates with PSS.
- Circadian instability and fragmentation: Low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.98) and elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.95), both modestly associated with higher PSS (interdaily stability r ≈ −0.11; IV r ≈ +0.16).
- Elevated trait anxiety and subclinical depressive symptoms: STAI = 43 (Z ≈ +0.17; r with PSS ≈ +0.31) and CES-D = 15 (Z ≈ +0.18; r ≈ +0.28), which push toward higher perceived stress.
- External/behavioral stressors: Recent GPA drop and lower engagement in restorative activities (reading Z ≈ −0.67) could add stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (protective)
- Lower physiological arousal indicators: Resting HR 54.2 bpm and MESOR below mean (Z ≈ −0.47 and −1.13) which correlate modestly with lower PSS in the sample.
- Low substance use and moderate health satisfaction: Minimal alcohol/drug use and positive health rating (Z ≈ +0.30).
- Some social and exercise engagement (small protective effects).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly elevated anxiety: GAD-7 = 10 (clinical threshold), and in this cohort anxiety correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ +0.77). This is a major risk signal.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance and short sleep duration: PSQI = 13.5 (high; r with PSS ≈ +0.49) and median recorded sleep ~3 h 55 min — a much more extreme reduction in sleep than Participant 1.
- Pain and pain interference: PEG-3 = 7.89 and PAPAS = 86, with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (~0.45–0.49), representing substantive experiential stressors.
- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9, with a strong correlation with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ +0.66).
- Circadian blunting/irregularity: Reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −1.51) and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.75), which modestly associate with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective)
- High general self-efficacy: NGSE = 38 (Z ≈ +1.41) with a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.68), a substantial protective factor.
- Relatively low interpersonal problems: BASIS-24 interpersonal score Z ≈ −1.27, reducing interpersonal stress contribution.
- Lower resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ −0.9 and −1.4) indicating physiological buffering.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective cohort means. The key question is which profile more strongly predicts a higher absolute PSS relative to peers in their own studies.
- Participant 1’s above-mean risk signals are principally sleep/circadian disruption and modestly elevated trait anxiety. Many of these predictors have only modest correlations with PSS in that cohort (r roughly 0.11–0.31), though some measures (e.g., interdaily stability Z ≈ −1.98, nap frequency Z ≈ +3.05) are notable.
- Participant 2’s risk signals include several measures that are both clinically elevated and have strong correlations with PSS in that cohort: anxiety (r ≈ +0.77), emotional lability (r ≈ +0.66), PSQI (r ≈ +0.49), and pain measures (~0.45–0.49). In addition, the participant’s objectively very short sleep (∼3 h 55 min) is more extreme than Participant 1’s sleep deficit (∼6 h 9 min).
- Protective factors for Participant 2 (notably high self-efficacy with r ≈ −0.68) are strong and reduce the net signal, but the number and strength of Participant 2’s high-risk indicators (some clinically meaningful and tightly correlated with PSS) likely outweigh the protective effects in terms of predicting higher perceived stress.
- Participant 1 has some physiological and behavioral buffers (low resting HR, low substance use, modest social/exercise engagement) and overall the strongest predictors of their elevated PSS are moderate in size. Participant 2 shows multiple, strongly predictive, clinically elevated self-report risk factors that are tightly linked to PSS in that sample.

Weighted judgment
- Given the comparative strengths of the predictors and their correlations with PSS in each cohort, Participant 2’s profile (clinically meaningful anxiety, severe subjective sleep disturbance and extremely short recorded sleep, pain/interference, and emotional lability — all with moderate-to-strong cohort correlations with PSS) represents a stronger and more direct set of drivers of higher perceived stress than Participant 1’s mainly circadian/sleep-timing and modest-anxiety signals.
- Therefore Participant 2 more likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study sample).

20,79341,21,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean):
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 41), which correlates positively with PSS in that cohort (r ≈ 0.31).
- Very low momentary positive affect (happiness Z ≈ -1.61), which correlates negatively with PSS and thus signals greater subjective distress.
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:50) and somewhat short sleep (median ≈ 6 h 46 m), both of which can increase perceived stress or reduce coping capacity.
- Slightly elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (Z ≈ 0.32), a measure weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Behavioral patterns (high video-game time, limited reading) that could reflect or contribute to stress-related coping styles.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean):
- Clinically meaningful anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 10) and a very strong correlation with PSS in that cohort (r ≈ 0.77).
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; correlation with PSS ≈ 0.49) and very short median recorded sleep (≈ 3 h 55 m), both strongly linked to higher perceived stress.
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (~0.45–0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9) with a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.51 and -0.75), wearable markers that modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Diurnal heart-rate pattern indicating compressed/shifted rest-activity; these sleep/circadian disruptions align with higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within the studies’ frames:
- Each description is framed relative to its own population mean PSS. Participant 1’s profile is mixed but leans toward near-or-slightly-below-mean PSS per the integrated interpretation: objective physiological and circadian markers (strong interdaily stability, low resting HR) are protective and correlations linking those markers to PSS are in the expected directions; subjective signals that raise concern are present but moderate (weaker correlations and smaller deviations).
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple strong, converging self-report indicators that are robustly and strongly correlated with PSS in that cohort (notably GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, and pain measures). Several of these predictors have large correlations with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.77 for anxiety), and the participant shows marked deviations (clinically meaningful anxiety, very poor sleep, high pain), producing a coherent picture that the participant’s PSS is above that study’s mean.
- The magnitude and number of elevated risk indicators for Participant 2 (and the large correlations those measures have with PSS) outweigh Participant 1’s mixed profile where objective physiological resilience counters modest subjective signals.

- High internalizing symptoms: CES-D = 32 (Z ≈ 1.95) and STAI = 58 (Z ≈ 1.65); both are among the strongest PSS predictors in that sample (CES-D–PSS r ≈ 0.27; STAI–PSS r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (disturbed) and large sleep-timing variability (SD ≈ 110 min), both of which correlate positively with PSS in this sample.
- Elevated tonic/evening cardiovascular arousal: high mesor (Z ≈ 2.01) and elevated resting HR (Z ≈ 1.62) and pronounced evening HR deviations—together these physiological signals support elevated stress (even if some individual HR–PSS correlations are modest).
- Low health satisfaction and underweight BMI (Z ≈ -2.03 and BMI 17.8) add to the overall distress signal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Very severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 21 (Z ≈ 2.04, “severe”) and this measure correlates strongly with PSS in that study (r ≈ 0.71) — a very potent indicator.
- Extreme subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 18 (Z ≈ 1.49) and median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min (very short) with high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min); fragmented/insufficient sleep is strongly linked to higher PSS.
- High pain and interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ 2.28) and pronounced emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ 2.42) — multiple high-Z indicators that are plausibly stress-amplifying.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29), which should increase perceived stress; several wearable features show circadian fragmentation and nocturnal HR deviations that have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51).
- Although there are some protective signs (low substance abuse, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), they are fewer and generally weaker than the above risk signals.

Comparative, within-frame weighing of evidence
- Both participants are described as “above mean” for their respective populations, but the strength and number of high-severity signals differ.
- Participant 1’s strongest indicators are elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (Z ≈ 1.6–2.0), with supporting signs from subjective sleep and elevated evening HR. However several protective/neutral signals (adequate objective sleep duration, strong interdaily stability, high social time) moderate the overall picture.
- Participant 2 shows more numerous and more extreme high-Z markers (severe anxiety Z ≈ 2.04; emotional lability Z ≈ 2.42; pain Z ≈ 2.28; very short objective sleep; low self-efficacy Z ≈ -2.29). Crucially, some of these measures (GAD-7, PSQI, certain nocturnal HR deviations) have relatively large correlations with PSS in that study (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71), making them especially predictive of elevated perceived stress.
- Overall, Participant 2’s profile contains stronger, more convergent and more highly predictive signals of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1’s profile, which contains important risk markers but also several buffering/neutral features.

Decision
Based on the balance of evidence (severity and number of high-Z risk indicators and the strength of their correlations with PSS in each study), Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

  - Low general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55), and self-efficacy is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.66).
- Objective wearable physiology corroborates high stress-relevant disturbance:

  - Circadian disruption: low amplitude, high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability, and near-zero 24-h autocorrelation—patterns associated with higher PSS.
  - Nocturnal heart-rate elevations during usual sleep hours that correlate positively with PSS (hourly deviations with r ≈ 0.36–0.40).
- Convergence across modalities (strongly predictive self-reports + physiological nocturnal arousal and rhythm disruption) points to PSS above the population mean (population mean = 20.92).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Elevated internalizing symptom burden that predicts higher PSS in this sample:
  - High depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; z ≈ 1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI = 58; z ≈ 1.65). Both correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.27–0.31).
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and late, variable sleep timing—both modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Wearable physiology consistent with elevated tonic/evening arousal:
  - High MESOR (z = 2.01) and elevated resting HR (z = 1.62).
  - Pronounced evening HR deviations (e.g., 10–11pm +16.3 bpm, z ≈ 1.55).
- Additional risk indicators: very low health satisfaction (z ≈ -2.03) and low BMI, which may accompany distress.
- Countervailing evidence that moderates inferred PSS:
  - Objective sleep duration is adequate (~7 h 16 m) and not reduced (z ≈ 0.10).
  - Stronger circadian regularity metrics (interdaily stability, 24-h autocorrelation, amplitude) that are associated with lower PSS in this sample.
  - Substantial social time and low substance use—behavioral buffers that likely reduce perceived stress impact.
- Overall, while several important predictors (CES-D, STAI, evening HR) point above the mean (population mean = 21.59), there are meaningful protective signals that moderate the inference.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means, but the nature and strength of the signals differ:
  - Participant 1 shows multiple highly PSS-relevant self-report measures with strong sample correlations (notably GAD-7 r = 0.78 and NGSE r = -0.66), extreme objective sleep reduction (~3 hours), clear nocturnal physiological arousal that itself correlates with PSS, and marked circadian disruption. These represent convergent, strong indicators tied closely to PSS in that sample.
  - Participant 2 has substantial internalizing symptoms (high CES-D and STAI) and elevated baseline/evening HR, but these predictors have more modest correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.27–0.31), and several robust protective/neutral signals (adequate objective sleep duration, good interdaily stability, high social time) partially offset the distress signals.
- Relative extremity: Participant 1’s objective sleep is profoundly abnormal (very short) and their anxiety measure has a much stronger demonstrated association with PSS in their dataset; Participant 2’s most extreme values are depressive/anxiety scores and mesor HR but with weaker PSS associations and countervailing protective factors.

Weighted conclusion
- On balance of the strength of predictors, multimodal convergence, and extremity of stress-relevant abnormalities (particularly the severe anxiety, extremely short/late sleep, circadian disruption, and nocturnal HR elevations in Participant 1), Participant 1 more likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z = +1.33; PAPAS Z = +0.43) — pain measures have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67 at late-night/early-morning) and reduced circadian robustness (reduced amplitude Z ≈ -0.34, lower 24‑h autocorrelation) — physiological arousal during usual sleep hours, which is associated with higher PSS.

- Wearable-derived circadian and sleep irregularity: late median sleep start (~02:56 AM), shortened average sleep (≈ 6 h 18 min; z ≈ -1.09), high night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +0.96), and elevated naps (z ≈ +1.75) — these index fragmented/rest instability that correlate (small-to-moderate) with higher PSS.
- Strong circadian disruption on physiology: very high intradaily variability (z ≈ +2.36), low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.07), low 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.20), and reduced amplitude (z ≈ -1.29) — objective markers associated with greater stress/circadian dysregulation.
- Elevated late‑evening heart‑rate deviation (10–11 PM deviation z ≈ +1.22) suggesting pre‑sleep arousal that can contribute to perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑population-frame reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its own study mean, but the qualitative magnitudes matter: Participant 1’s objective sleep abnormality is extreme (median ~3.5 hours), and pain is notably elevated (PEG‑3 Z +1.33). Those are large, directly stress‑relevant signals in that sample and the participant’s summary explicitly infers PSS above their population mean.
- Participant 2 shows meaningful objective circadian/sleep dysregulation (some large Zs, e.g., intradaily variability +2.36), but their self‑report symptom and well‑being measures are strongly protective (CES‑D and STAI well below mean; very high self‑esteem and happiness z-scores). The Participant 2 summary explicitly infers PSS below the population mean.
- Comparing severity and immediacy of stress‑relevant features across participants: Participant 1 has more extreme and directly stress-linked abnormalities (severe sleep curtailment, clinically disturbed subjective sleep, elevated pain and nocturnal arousal) that are tightly associated with PSS. Participant 2’s objective physiology shows circadian instability that is concerning, but is counterbalanced by robust low symptom reports and positive well‑being, yielding an overall inference of below‑mean PSS in that sample.

Weighted conclusion
- On balance, Participant 1’s profile indicates a higher likelihood of elevated perceived stress relative to their population than Participant 2’s profile indicates relative to theirs. Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

4,45963,31,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample):
- Markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 62; Z = 2.05), a known correlate of higher PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 22; Z = 0.9), which correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) and markedly irregular sleep timing (median start ~01:56; start-time SD Z = 2.89).  
- Physiological indicators of higher baseline arousal: resting HR and MESOR Z ≈ 1.1–1.2.  
- Strong circadian disruption (amplitude Z = −2.13; interdaily stability Z = −2.06), and these circadian irregularities are negatively associated with PSS in the cohort (lower amplitude/stability → higher PSS).  
- Taken together these convergent psychological, sleep, physiological, and circadian signals point toward above-average perceived stress in that sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample):
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51), and anxiety in this sample is a very strong predictor of PSS (r ≈ 0.75).  
- Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) with objectively short sleep duration (~4 h 55 min) and late sleep timing. PSQI also shows a substantial correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).  
- Elevated pain and activity-interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.63), which correlate with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = −1.73), a strong negative predictor of PSS in the cohort (r ≈ −0.61), indicating reduced coping capacity.  
- Nocturnal physiological hyperarousal (large positive hourly HR deviations at night; e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83), which aligns with nighttime mechanisms that correlate with higher PSS.  
- These symptom-level measures (especially severe anxiety, low self-efficacy, pain, and nocturnal HR) are strongly and directly linked to higher PSS in this sample.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and weighing of evidence:
- Participant 1 has several large z-scores in circadian disruption and some elevated physiological baselines, plus a very large sleep-timing variability z (2.89). However, many of those circadian/physiological predictors have only modest correlations with PSS in that cohort (r values typically small-to-moderate), and Participant 1 also shows resilience/protective signs (strong academic functioning, low substance use, some social/exercise engagement). Their strongest single psychological z is STAI trait Z = 2.05, but in this sample STAI’s correlation with PSS is modest (≈0.31).
- Participant 2’s profile features multiple high-impact, symptom-level predictors that have large correlations with PSS in that cohort: severe anxiety (r ≈ 0.75), low self-efficacy (r ≈ −0.61), elevated PSQI (r ≈ 0.47), plus pain/interference. Objective nocturnal HR elevations and very short sleep provide physiological corroboration. Although Participant 2 retains some protective circadian regularity, the dominant signals are strong, proximal predictors of perceived stress and indicate clinically meaningful dysfunction (severe anxiety, short sleep, pain, low coping).
- Overall, Participant 2’s key predictors are both severe and more strongly associated with PSS in their sample than Participant 1’s strongest predictors are in theirs. The convergence of severe anxiety, low self-efficacy, high pain interference, marked sleep restriction, and nocturnal hyperarousal suggests a larger elevation above Participant 2’s sample mean PSS than the combination of circadian disruption plus moderate-to-high anxiety/depression suggests for Participant 1.

10,92566,10,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence favoring relatively higher perceived stress within their sample):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and objectively short median sleep (~6 h 17 min; Z ≈ -1.11), both of which have modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- High night-to-night sleep variability (SD ≈ 120 min; Z = 0.43) and late, variable sleep timing (median start 00:48; SD ≈ 113 min; Z = 0.66), features that show small positive associations with PSS.
- Early-morning and some nocturnal heart-rate deviations that correlate positively with PSS (small correlations, r up to ~0.21), suggesting some nocturnal/early-morning physiological activation linked to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian fragmentation markers (intradaily variability and related hourly HR deviations) that have small positive correlations with PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence favoring relatively higher perceived stress within their sample):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) despite objectively adequate duration (median ~7 h 10 min), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42).
- Some early-morning nocturnal heart-rate deviations that are modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), though these effects are smaller than the strongest psychosocial correlations.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and weighing of evidence:
- Both descriptions conclude the participant is likely below their population mean PSS, but the balance of protective vs risk signals differs in strength.
- Participant 2’s protective signals are very strong and numerous: extremely high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.79; NGSE–PSS r ≈ -0.60), very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -1.38; GAD–PSS r ≈ +0.75), very low resting HR (Z ≈ -2.23), and robust circadian regularity (interdaily stability and amplitude Zs ≈ +1.8–1.9). These large-magnitude, highly correlated protective indicators weigh heavily toward substantially lower PSS relative to that cohort.
- Participant 1 also shows multiple protective markers (very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high happiness/self-esteem, regular exercise, low RHR), but the protective signals are generally of smaller standardized magnitude than Participant 2’s (e.g., STAI-Trait Z = -1.71 and CES-D Z = -0.86, vs P2’s multiple Zs > |1.8|). Critically, Participant 1’s sleep deficits (short sleep, subjective disturbance, higher variability) are more pronounced and more directly tied to increased PSS in this sample than the relatively modest nocturnal HR signals that affect Participant 2.
- Net effect: Participant 2’s profile shows stronger and more numerous protective markers with only one isolated notable risk (PSQI), whereas Participant 1’s profile includes meaningful sleep-related risks that lessen but do not eliminate protective factors. Thus, relative to their own cohort means, Participant 1 likely has a higher (worse) PSS than Participant 2.

18,81420,18,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong anxiety signal: GAD‑7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) and GAD‑7 has a very high sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.80), so elevated anxiety here is a potent indicator of higher perceived stress.  
- Severe objective sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 (clinically disturbed); wearable median sleep ≈ 2 h 19 m (Z = -1.04) and very late/variable sleep timing (start SD Z = 1.16). These are extreme sleep abnormalities that commonly drive higher perceived stress.  
- Nighttime physiological arousal: elevated resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = 1.67), low circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), and marked nocturnal HR elevations (+8–9 bpm around midnight–2 AM) that positively correlate with PSS — a coherent pattern of physiological hyperarousal linked to stress.  
- Elevated emotional lability and pain/interference (BASIS‑24 and PEG/PAPAS) that correlate positively with PSS and add psychosocial burden.  
- Although there is a modest protective buffer (slightly higher self‑efficacy), most of the strongest PSS‑linked signals (anxiety, very short/irregular sleep, nocturnal HR arousal) point toward above‑mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated mood/anxiety symptoms: CES‑D = 25 (Z = 1.22) and STAI = 50 (Z = 0.86); both correlate positively with PSS and indicate substantial depressive and trait‑anxiety burden.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (Z = 0.59) despite objective total sleep being near median — the quantity/quality mismatch is associated with greater perceived stress.  
- Circadian/HR signs of dysregulation: reduced amplitude (Z = -0.74), slightly elevated MESOR (Z = 0.6) and resting HR (Z = 0.53), and low interdaily stability (Z = -0.99) with late/variable sleep timing — consistent with attenuated day–night recovery and irregular routines linked to higher stress.  
- Low self‑esteem and lower health satisfaction (RSES Z ≈ -1.01) further align with higher perceived stress.  
- However, there are several notably protective/mitigating features (objective total sleep ≈ 7 h, low intradaily variability Z = -1.66, regular exercise Z = 1.07, social contact), which reduce the overall stress signal relative to the participant’s sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are characterized as likely above their respective population PSS means. But the nature and magnitude of the indicators differ. Participant 1’s profile includes extremely short objective sleep (very large deviation), higher resting HR (larger Z), marked nocturnal HR elevations that correlate with PSS, and a very strong anxiety→PSS association in the sample (GAD‑7 r = 0.80). Those features are both severe and are described as having strong sample‑level associations with PSS.  
- Participant 2 shows substantial depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES‑D Z = 1.22, STAI Z = 0.86) and some physiological flattening, but also retains multiple protective features (normal objective sleep duration, low intradaily variability, regular exercise, social contact) that the summary explicitly notes mitigate the stress signal. The physiological deviations in Participant 2 are more modest in magnitude (smaller Zs for RHR and amplitude) than Participant 1’s physiological deviations.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1’s combination of very short/irregular sleep, nighttime physiological arousal, elevated resting heart rate, and high anxiety (with strong sample correlation to PSS) is a stronger and more extreme constellation of PSS‑linked indicators than Participant 2’s profile, which, while showing elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, is offset by normal objective sleep duration and several behavioral resilience factors.  
- Therefore Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study mean) than Participant 2.

- Strong, convergent self-report risk signals that correlate highly with PSS: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16, z = 1.16; r with PSS ≈ 0.78), very high PSQI (15), elevated pain interference (PEG-3 z = 1.18), and emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 1.23).
- Low perceived coping resources (NGSE z = -1.55), a robust negative correlate of PSS.
- Severe objective sleep/circadian disruption that aligns with stress: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability and low interdaily stability, flattened circadian amplitude (z = -1.4).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: marked heart-rate elevations during typical sleep hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.40).
- Multiple independent modalities (self-report + wearables) point in the same direction, producing a coherent signal of above-average perceived stress relative to this cohort.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Objective and subjective sleep restriction and timing risk: median sleep ~5h55 (z = -1.58), PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), very late median sleep start (~02:57) and moderate night-to-night variability—sleep features often associated with higher perceived stress.
- Modest circadian blunting (amplitude z ≈ -0.36) and small early-morning HR deviations that show weak positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.22).

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or not elevated) PSS
- Multiple strong protective/self-report signals: low depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ -0.97), low trait anxiety (STAI‑Trait z ≈ -0.52), high happiness (z ≈ 1.64) and above-average self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ 0.4).
- Good functional outcomes (excellent GPA), modest substance use, and social/physical activity engagement.
- Physiological indicators of low baseline arousal and preserved rhythm: relatively low resting HR, normal/intermediate interdaily stability and high 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ 0.73), low intradaily variability—these tend to protect against sustained perceived stress.
- Holistic summary in the description concludes PSS is near/slightly below the cohort mean.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own cohort mean (P1 mean PSS = 20.92; P2 mean PSS = 21.62). Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their cohort mean based on multiple, strongly correlated indicators. Participant 2 is inferred to be near or slightly below their cohort mean, with the main risk signal limited to sleep-shortness/timing while many other domains indicate low distress.
- Magnitude and convergence matter: Participant 1 shows high-magnitude abnormalities across both self-report and physiology (severe anxiety, extremely short sleep, nocturnal HR arousal, multiple z-scores >1), whereas Participant 2’s strongest abnormalities are limited to sleep duration/timing (moderate z), with many protective features counterbalancing.
- Therefore, even accounting for differences in cohort means, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is experiencing worse overall perceived stress.

16,23287,23,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV) in activity (z ≈ 0.17) and increased night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ 0.67), both of which have modest positive correlations with PSS in the cohort and can reflect fragmented/restless patterns that relate to perceived stress.
- Elevated nap frequency (mean 0.25 naps/day, z = 2.07) which correlates modestly with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.15) and could indicate daytime tiredness or compensatory sleep linked to stress.
- Limited in-person socializing (16–30 minutes; z ≈ -1.41), reducing social buffering that typically lowers perceived stress.
- Higher daily internet use (3–4 hours; z ≈ 1.52), which in this cohort has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.11).
- Pronounced evening heart-rate deviations (large positive deviations around 9–11 pm, z up to ≈ 2.37) that may reflect evening physiological arousal/rumination; though hourly deviations are only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 12), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.50), so poor subjective sleep strongly favors higher perceived stress.
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z ≈ 0.53) with a strong correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.65), making this a potent contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (RHR z ≈ +1.37; mesor z ≈ +1.18), indicating higher baseline cardiovascular tone associated with stress-related arousal.
- Pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM) during hours that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), consistent with impaired overnight recovery and higher stress.
- Very long median sleep duration and very large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration z ≈ +2.26; SD z ≈ +2.38), which reflect unstable sleep regulation that in context can accompany stress-related dysregulation even if wearable-sleep measures have weaker direct correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Flattened circadian amplitude and late acrophase combined with elevated baseline HR — a physiological pattern often seen with sustained arousal or poor recovery.

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame
- Participant 1 is described as having multiple strong protective indicators relative to their study population: very low resting HR and mesor (z ≈ -2.1 to -2.2), low depressive and anxiety symptoms, good subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ -1.72), long objective nightly sleep (z ≈ +1.49), and high health satisfaction (z ≈ +1.71). These features are noted as strongly weighted in the profile and are directly associated with lower PSS in that cohort. The factors that point toward higher stress for P1 are smaller in magnitude and have only modest or weak correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the study mean PSS but shows several domain-specific elevations that are both substantive in magnitude (e.g., PSQI = 12, large nocturnal HR increases, emotional lability) and are tied to relatively strong correlations with PSS in their cohort (notably emotional lability r ≈ 0.65 and PSQI r ≈ 0.50). Although P2 also has protective features (low pain, relatively preserved interpersonal functioning, mild anxiety), the presence of multiple indicators that are both elevated and moderately-to-strongly associated with PSS increases the likelihood that this participant’s perceived stress is higher than Participant 1’s.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Participant 1: overall profile points below the population mean PSS; dominant signals are protective and strongly linked to lower perceived stress.
- Participant 2: a mixed profile but with several domain-specific risk indicators that are more directly and strongly associated with higher PSS in that study (subjective sleep disturbance, emotional lability, elevated nocturnal and resting HR).
- Therefore, comparing the two within their respective population frames, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

7,24833,15,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population):
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 15.5 (z = 0.67) and classified as “Disturbed Sleep.” In this dataset PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53), so this is a relatively strong predictor of elevated perceived stress.  
- Extremely short and variable wearable sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 4 h 22 min and high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD z ≈ 0.89), which plausibly increases perceived stress and functional strain.  
- Notable interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships subscale z = 2.34 (large departure from the sample mean), a contextual risk factor that commonly amplifies perceived stress even if that subscale correlates weakly with PSS in the sample.  
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened rhythm amplitude (interdaily stability and autocorrelation low, cosinor amplitude low), which often co-occur with higher stress and disrupted sleep.

Protective/contrary signs for Participant 1 that temper the inference: very low anxiety (GAD-7 z ≈ -1.38), low pain (PAPAS z ≈ -1.29), low emotional lability (z ≈ -1.27), near-average self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.07), and below-mean resting HR. These reduce the likelihood of extremely high PSS and lead the original synthesis to place this participant near the population mean with a modest tilt above it.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Pronounced circadian irregularity: interdaily stability z ≈ -1.98, 24-h autocorrelation z ≈ -1.79, and reduced amplitude z ≈ -1.58. These are large deviations relative to that study’s norms and (even if only modestly correlated with PSS in the sample) point toward elevated stress risk.  
- Late and variable sleep timing: median sleep start ≈ 02:10 AM and PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), both commonly associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Elevated physiological arousal: resting HR z ≈ 0.78 and some early-morning heart-rate deviations that correlate modestly with PSS; intradaily variability z ≈ 0.46 (fragmentation) which correlates positively with PSS.

Protective/contrary signs for Participant 2: relatively low trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ -0.82) and low depressive symptoms (CES-D z ≈ -0.34), above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction (z ≈ +0.8), and some regular health behaviors (exercise, socializing, no recreational drug use). These features argue toward below-mean PSS and led the original synthesis to place this participant near the mean but leaning somewhat above it.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame and weighing the evidence:
- Strength and relevance of predictors: For Participant 1, the single strongest sample-level predictor cited is subjective sleep quality (PSQI), which has a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53) in that dataset. Participant 1’s PSQI is extreme (15.5) and wearable sleep duration is severely short (≈4.4 h), both highly likely to push perceived stress upward in that population. Participant 1 also has a very large interpersonal-problems z-score (2.34), which is a substantial contextual risk even if its sample correlation with PSS is weaker.
- For Participant 2, the most prominent deviations are large circadian-regularity deficits (z ≈ -1.6 to -2.0). However, those circadian metrics show only modest correlations with PSS in that study (r values on the order of ~0.12–0.17). Participant 2’s subjective sleep disturbance is present but much less extreme (PSQI = 7), and mood/anxiety measures are relatively low (protective).
- Net effect: Participant 1’s combination of very poor subjective sleep (a relatively strong, moderate-correlating predictor), extreme objective short sleep, and major interpersonal difficulties are more compelling signals of elevated perceived stress within that study’s correlational structure than Participant 2’s primarily circadian-based deviations (which are large in z but only modestly predictive of PSS in that sample) combined with protective affective/self-esteem scores.

- Very low interdaily stability (0.22; Z = −1.56) and high night-to-night sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.48) — irregular circadian timing is linked to higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness (Z = −0.53) and modestly elevated MESOR (Z = 0.46) plus evening/night HR deviations — possible signs of higher physiological arousal or poorer recovery.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might NOT have a high PSS (protective factors)
- Relatively long median nightly sleep (8:00 h; Z = 1.01) and very low nap frequency (Z = −0.86), which indicate adequate sleep opportunity.
- Frequent participation in sports (Z = 1.58), normative depressive symptoms (CES‑D ≈ 0 Z), typical resting HR (Z = 0.15), moderate social engagement and stable academics — all associated with lower PSS or resilience.
- Net interpretation in the record: above-mean but only a mild-to-moderate elevation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6) is especially salient given a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78) — a powerful predictor here.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) with moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Pain/interference (PEG‑3 ≈ 6.78; PAPAS z = 0.24) — both positively correlated with PSS.
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = −0.68) and very high sleep-duration variability (SD z = 1.7) — patterns commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.54).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might NOT have a high PSS (protective factors)
- Relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE z = 0.3) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r = −0.65) — a notable buffering factor.
- No substance problems (BASIS‑24 substance z = −1.62), low emotional lability (z = −0.37), and normative resting HR (z = 0.15).
- Long median sleep duration (8 h 52 min; z = 1.19) though this co-occurs with very high variability and poor subjective quality.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both participant summaries conclude the individual is likely modestly above their respective sample mean PSS (Participant 1: “above the population mean… mild-to-moderate elevation”; Participant 2: “slightly above the study population mean”).
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2 shows several strong, PSS-predictive signals (GAD‑7 with r = 0.78; PSQI = 13; high sleep variability z = 1.7; pain interference) that are tightly linked to higher PSS in that sample. Participant 1’s strongest objective signal is very low interdaily stability (z = −1.56) and elevated sleep-timing variability, but their self-report anxiety and PSQI elevations are smaller (lower Zs) and they have multiple strong protective behaviors (frequent sports, long nightly sleep, normative depression scores).
- Protective vs. risk balance: Participant 1’s protective factors (notably regular exercise and adequate total sleep) appear more numerous and pronounced than Participant 2’s protective factors are strong; whereas Participant 2’s risk indicators include measures with high sample-level predictive power for PSS (especially GAD‑7 and PSQI).
- Given the within-sample correlations and the magnitudes of the risk indicators, Participant 2’s profile is more consistently aligned with the stronger PSS predictors in that study, suggesting a somewhat greater elevation above their sample mean than Participant 1’s elevation above theirs.

  - Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5) with a very large correlation to PSS in this dataset (r = 0.80).
  - High emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 6.33), correlated strongly with PSS (r = 0.67).
  - Pain and activity interference (PEG-3 = 5.56, PAPAS = 55), moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).
- Wearable signs of nocturnal autonomic perturbation: late-night HR deviations at hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with stress-linked arousal.
- Integrative note: although some objective physiology (strong circadian amplitude, regular daytime activation, long objective sleep opportunity) are protective, the self-report measures that most strongly predict PSS in this sample are substantially elevated and are judged to outweigh the protective wearable signals. The original summary therefore infers PSS above the population mean (20.75).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularities that (modestly) associate with higher PSS in this sample:
  - Low interdaily stability (Z = -1.23; interdaily stability correlates negatively with PSS, so low stability modestly indicates higher stress).
  - Slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.10) and reduced cosinor amplitude (Z = -0.71), both of which have small correlations with PSS in the dataset.
  - Late median sleep start (~01:03 AM), which may compound reduced daily regularity.
- Integrative note: these circadian/behavioral signals point modestly toward greater stress risk, but their effect sizes/correlations with PSS are small relative to the strong psychological wellbeing signals.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Participant 1: multiple self-report measures that have strong correlations with PSS in that study (GAD-7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67; PSQI r = 0.59) are elevated. These are high-weight predictors and the original interpretation placed this participant above their population mean (20.75) despite some protective wearable features.
- Participant 2: psychological/self-report indicators of wellbeing (very low CES-D and STAI; high self-esteem and happiness; good sleep and exercise) are consistently favorable and the original interpretation placed this participant below their population mean (21.62). The countervailing wearable circadian irregularities have only modest correlations with PSS in this dataset.
- Magnitude and predictive weight favor Participant 1 being more stressed: Participant 1’s elevated predictors are both numerous and strongly correlated with PSS; Participant 2’s risk signals are fewer and have smaller effect sizes.

Overall judgement
- Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

  - Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r = -0.66), indicating reduced coping resources.
- Convergence of multiple subjective indicators (anxiety, sleep complaints, affective instability, pain, lower self-efficacy) that have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS — this concentrated subjective signal strongly favors above-mean perceived stress.
- Counterpoint: wearable physiology (organized circadian metrics, low resting HR) suggests some physiological resilience, but these features have smaller correlations with PSS and do not outweigh the strong subjective signal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean 21.6)
- Elevated affective symptoms:
  - Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29; Z = 1.63) and mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.46). Both are positively associated with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Sleep/circadian disturbance and variability:
  - Very delayed median sleep onset (~03:45 AM), long but highly variable sleep duration (SD = 173 min; Z = 1.65), and low 24-h autocorrelation (0.19; Z = -1.12) — all consistent with circadian irregularity that tends to accompany higher perceived stress.
  - Pronounced late-afternoon/evening heart-rate elevation (5–6 pm deviation Z = 2.76), which may reflect episodic physiological arousal.
- Countervailing protective factors: minimal substance use, relatively low resting HR/MESOR, frequent group exercise, and modestly higher happiness/health satisfaction — these moderate the likely net increase in perceived stress.
- Importantly, the affective predictors in Participant 2 (CES-D, STAI) have smaller correlations with PSS than Participant 1’s primary predictors.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and effect sizes: Participant 1’s strongest self-report predictors (GAD-7 r = 0.74; BASIS-24 r = 0.63; NGSE r = -0.66) are substantially more strongly correlated with PSS than Participant 2’s key predictors (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). That makes Participant 1’s elevated scores more diagnostic of above-mean PSS within their cohort.
- Magnitude of symptom elevation: Participant 1 shows extremely elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65) and severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 18), whereas Participant 2’s PSQI is only marginally above cutoff (PSQI = 6) despite high CES-D. Participant 1’s combination of very high anxiety plus severe sleep complaints and affective lability is a stronger, more convergent signal of elevated PSS than Participant 2’s mixed profile.
- Objective physiology: both participants show some physiological resilience (low resting HR), but these physiologic signals have smaller associations with PSS and do not offset Participant 1’s strong subjective indicators. Participant 2’s large evening HR spike is notable but its link to PSS is weaker than Participant 1’s subjective predictors.
- Protective factors: Participant 2 has several lifestyle protections (no substance use, frequent social exercise, modest happiness) that temper inferred stress; Participant 1 has fewer such mitigating lifestyle signals.

Overall judgment
- Both participants are inferred above their respective population means, but the balance of evidence (stronger predictors, larger effect sizes, more extreme subjective symptom elevations) indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

3,74413,13,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV Z = 1.51), and somewhat low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.41). IV in this sample correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.17), so circadian/within-day fragmentation is a stress-linked risk.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (e.g., 10–11 pm +22.05 bpm, Z = 2.46). Large evening arousal episodes are plausibly linked to rumination/episodic stress and some hourly HR deviations correlate with PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as “disturbed”), which is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.2), modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). In this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), so poor perceived sleep is a substantive risk.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG/PAPAS values) that are nontrivial and correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54) and elevated basal physiology (mesor and resting HR Z ≈ 1.2), which can accompany greater perceived stress (though physiological correlations are weaker).

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Both profiles are interpreted in their respective descriptions as near the population mean PSS and tending slightly below the mean. Thus we compare relative strength of stress-linked signals vs. protective signals within each profile rather than raw PSS numbers.
- Participant 1’s stronger protective signals: low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ -1.02), high self-esteem (Z ≈ 1.1), regular exercise, adequate and regular objective sleep (~7.5 h, low night-to-night variability), and relatively low resting HR. Several of these measures (CES-D, STAI) have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample, so P1’s low scores on those scales are substantial protective evidence.
- Participant 1’s main risks (circadian fragmentation and large evening HR spikes, PSQI = 6) are meaningful but either have smaller sample correlations with PSS (IV r ≈ 0.17; hourly HR deviations modest) or are only mildly elevated (PSQI moderately disturbed).
- Participant 2’s strong protective signals include very high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.41) and pronounced circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = 2.13, low IV Z = -1.05); NGSE shows a strong inverse correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.63), so this is an important protective factor.
- Participant 2’s notable risks—very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5) and pain/interference—are both moderately correlated with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.47; pain ≈ 0.42–0.47) and are moderately elevated in this person.
- Net comparison: Participant 1’s low depression/anxiety and behavioral protections are strong and map to constructs that are moderately predictive of lower PSS in their sample. Participant 2 has a pronounced protective advantage in self-efficacy and circadian regularity (NGSE is a very strong predictor), but also has larger subjective sleep problems and pain/interference than Participant 1. The sleep- and pain-related risk signals in Participant 2 are stronger (larger absolute PSQI and nontrivial pain) and are associated with larger sample correlations with PSS than some of Participant 1’s risk markers (e.g., IV, hourly HR). Overall, Participant 2’s combination of high PSQI and pain/interference provides a larger set of stress-linked risk factors than Participant 1, and those risks are not fully offset by protective factors to the same apparent degree as Participant 1’s strong low depression/anxiety profile.

Conclusion
Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

14,28254,24,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evident in the description)
- Sleep disturbance and subjective poor sleep: PSQI = 7 (classified as disturbed sleep), which is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Irregular and late sleep timing: Elevated sleep start variability (SD ≈ 122 min, z = 0.86) and late median sleep start (~00:50) — timing irregularity correlates with higher PSS (sleep-start variability r ≈ 0.18).
- Blunted circadian metrics: Low interdaily stability (0.28, z ≈ -1.07), reduced amplitude (z ≈ -0.78), and low 24-hr autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.61); these objective markers are associated with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Mildly elevated resting heart rate: Resting HR 61.9 bpm (z ≈ +0.45), with resting HR positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.14).
- Synthesis note: Although several objective physiological/circadian signals point toward higher perceived stress, they are counterbalanced by notably low depression/anxiety and high self-esteem. The net inference in this study frame is near the population mean with a modest tilt above.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evident in the description)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety and strong predictor of PSS: GAD-7 = 10.5 (around clinical threshold) and reported correlation with PSS r ≈ 0.77 — one of the strongest single predictors described.
- Elevated emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z = 0.53) and strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 8.5 (disturbed), with moderate correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.55).
- Pain/interference: PEG-3 mean 8.33 and PAPAS z = 1.21, both positively correlated with PSS (PEG-3 r ≈ 0.43; PAPAS r ≈ 0.47).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Substantial overnight HR elevations (e.g., +13.9 bpm at 12–1am, z = 1.36) with these nocturnal deviations correlated with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).
- Sleep variability/fragmentation: Large night-to-night sleep SD (199 min, z = 0.65) — variability linked to higher stress.
- Protective features exist (self-efficacy, good interdaily stability and amplitude, low resting HR, low substance use), but the strongest and most directly PSS-linked signals (anxiety, emotional lability, PSQI, pain, nocturnal HR spikes) point clearly above the study mean.

Comparative, within-study-frame reasoning
- Both participant profiles are mixed, but the balance of evidence differs in strength and direction:
  - Participant 1: Objective circadian/sleep metrics and resting HR provide moderate signals toward higher PSS, but self-report trait mood measures (CES-D, STAI) and high self-esteem are substantially below the sample mean and are strong protective indicators. The description explicitly concludes P1 is near the population mean (Population mean PSS = 21.62), with only a modest tilt above if objective signals are weighted.
  - Participant 2: Multiple strong self-report predictors that are tightly correlated with PSS (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77 and emotional lability r ≈ 0.65), plus disturbed PSQI, elevated pain interference, and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations. The description explicitly concludes P2’s perceived stress is meaningfully above their population mean (Population mean PSS = 20.92).
- Relative strength of evidence: Participant 2’s high-anxiety score (and very strong correlation with PSS), high PSQI, elevated pain, and large nocturnal HR z-scores constitute a cluster of converging, moderately-to-strongly PSS-associated indicators. Participant 1’s signals that favor higher PSS are primarily objective circadian/sleep irregularities with weaker correlations to PSS and are counterbalanced by strong low-depression/anxiety self-report measures.
- Therefore, within each study’s frame and relative to their respective population means, Participant 2 shows a stronger, more consistent pattern of indicators associated with elevated perceived stress than Participant 1.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",28254,NetHealth,19,14,Pain,24
8,43794,20,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report signs linked to PSS: elevated anxiety (GAD-7), disturbed sleep (PSQI = 13), and emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = +0.63). The summary notes these measures have strong correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., GAD–PSS r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66; PSQI r = 0.49), which increases confidence that these elevations map onto higher PSS relative to the study mean (21.08).
- Objective physiology consistent with hyperarousal: elevated resting HR (Z ≈ +1.19) and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.24), plus pronounced early-morning heart-rate deviations correlated with PSS. These align with the self-report indicators of stress.
- Marked sleep-timing and duration abnormalities: very late sleep onset (~04:36) and extremely short median nightly sleep (median ~1h39, Z ≈ −1.27), plus naps (Z = +1.24). If valid, this pattern implies severe nocturnal dysregulation and likely higher perceived stress.
- Multiple independent domains converge (anxiety, sleep disturbance subjective and objective, emotional lability, pain interference, physiological arousal), so the evidence is coherent and leans toward above-mean PSS.

Mitigating notes from the summary:
- Some signals are only mild (GAD-7 in mild range), some wearable–PSS correlations are inconsistent, and the very short wearable-estimated sleep may reflect device non-wear/artifact. These reduce certainty but do not negate the multiple converging stress signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z ≈ +1.35), which the summary indicates correlates positively with PSS and is one of the strongest self-report indicators for this participant.
- Objective physiological and circadian dysregulation: elevated resting HR (Z ≈ +1.50), blunted amplitude and very low interdaily stability (amplitude Z ≈ −1.76; interdaily stability Z ≈ −1.73), and increased intradaily fragmentation — a cluster commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8) and large night-to-night variability in sleep timing/duration (sleep SD Zs ≈ +0.86 to +1.25), which are associated with stress even though median sleep duration is near normal (~7 h).
- Lower happiness/self-esteem (Zs negative) add psychosocial weight toward elevated perceived stress.

Mitigating notes from the summary:
- Near-normal median sleep duration, low depressive symptom score, limited substance use, and some leisure/social activities may attenuate overall stress impact. Several protective/neutral features make extreme PSS less certain.

Comparative reasoning within each study context
- Both participants are judged in their source summaries to be above their respective population means (P1 vs mean 21.08; P2 vs mean 21.6).
- Strength and convergence of predictors: Participant 1 shows multiple high-correlation self-report measures (notably GAD–PSS r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, self-efficacy r = −0.65, PSQI r = 0.49) and convergent objective signs (elevated HR/MESOR, blunted amplitude, early-morning HR elevation). Participant 2 also shows strong signals (trait anxiety, elevated resting HR, very low interdaily stability and amplitude), but several mitigating/neutral indicators (near-7 h median sleep, low depressive symptoms, active coping/leisure behaviors) are more prominent in P2’s profile.
- Magnitude of circadian disruption: P2’s amplitude and interdaily stability Zs are more extreme (~−1.7) than P1’s amplitude Z (~−1.05), which favors P2 on circadian dysregulation. However, P1 has a much worse subjective sleep score (PSQI = 13 vs 8) and an objectively extreme (though possibly artifactual) short sleep metric and very late sleep timing, adding stronger subjective and behavioral evidence of stress.
- Correlation relevance: The summary explicitly notes that several of Participant 1’s elevated measures have very high correlations with PSS (especially anxiety and emotional lability), which makes those elevations more predictive of higher PSS in that sample. Participant 2’s strongest single predictor is trait anxiety (Z ≈ +1.35), but other mitigating features reduce confidence that P2’s PSS is higher than P1’s.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants are most likely above their study means. Comparing the profiles, Participant 1 displays a denser convergence of high-correlation self-report predictors of PSS (anxiety, PSQI, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) plus objective signs of physiological hyperarousal and severely atypical sleep timing/duration (even allowing for possible artifact). Participant 2 has notable physiological/circadian dysregulation and high trait anxiety, but also several mitigating factors (near-normal median sleep duration, low depressive symptoms, social/exercise/music activities) that reduce the likelihood of an extremely elevated PSS relative to peers.
- Given the combination of (a) multiple self-report measures that have strong, documented correlations with PSS in the P1 sample and (b) convergent objective indicators of hyperarousal and severe sleep disturbance in Participant 1, the balance favors Participant 1 as having the higher overall perceived stress.

Conclusion

23,44927,17,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 1’s population mean = 21.21)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 m) and large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), both patterns that are associated with higher PSS.
- Pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.46), suggesting nocturnal arousal that maps onto stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.61)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 40), a measure that is positively associated with PSS (STAI–PSS r ≈ 0.31).
- Lower self‑esteem and lower current happiness (both modestly associated with higher PSS).
- Reduced circadian amplitude and slightly lower interdaily stability (both associated with higher PSS in this sample).
- Late sleep timing (~00:59) and somewhat short objective sleep (median ≈ 6 h 34 m), which can increase stress vulnerability despite acceptable subjective sleep quality.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s strongest predictors of lower PSS are very low anxiety (GAD‑7 = 2.0) and relatively high self‑efficacy; these measures have large correlations with PSS in that study (GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.65), making them powerful protective signals relative to the sample mean. The sleep- and nocturnal‑HR signals that point upward are moderate predictors of PSS (r ≈ 0.46–0.48) but are outweighed in magnitude by the strong trait-level protective signals.
- Participant 2’s risk indicators (trait anxiety, lower self‑esteem/happiness, blunted circadian features, late/short sleep) are present but generally have smaller correlations with PSS than Participant 1’s protective measures do in their sample. Participant 2’s profile is explicitly judged in its summary as “near-to-slightly-above” that study’s mean PSS, reflecting a balance of modest risk and modest protective factors.
- In short, Participant 1 is inferred to be below their study mean PSS largely because very low anxiety and higher self‑efficacy (strong predictors) dominate the profile despite clear sleep problems. Participant 2 is inferred to be at or slightly above their study mean PSS because multiple modest risk markers are present and the summary already leans slightly above the mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: net inference = below their population mean PSS (protective trait measures with large predictive weights outweigh moderate sleep-related risk signals).
- Participant 2: net inference = near-to-slightly-above their population mean PSS (several modest risk markers and the text explicitly leans slightly above the mean).

19,72348,28,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated resting heart rate and cardiac mesor (RHR Z ≈ +1.55; mesor Z ≈ +1.69). These physiological elevations can reflect chronic sympathetic activation and are positively (though weakly) correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; Z ≈ +0.59) and somewhat lower momentary happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), which are commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Small positive scores on measures that correlate with PSS (CES-D, STAI correlations ~0.28–0.31), even if these are not large in absolute terms.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Strong subjective and objective sleep disruption: very poor PSQI (16.5; Z = +1.0, r with PSS ≈ 0.47), extremely short median sleep (2 h 38 m; Z ≈ -0.94), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median 03:12, sleep onset SD Z ≈ +1.3). These sleep metrics are directly and moderately associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (overnight HR deviations Z ≈ +1.17 to +1.59) with moderate correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38), consistent with physiological activation during usual sleep time.
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and the fact that GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.78), making anxiety a powerful predictor of elevated perceived stress.
- Pain-related interference (PAPAS) that correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.48) and likely contributes to stress.
- Circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, higher intradaily variability) indicating behavioral/physiological desynchrony typically linked to greater perceived stress.

Countervailing/protective factors to consider
- For Participant 1: strong, consistent circadian structure and objectively adequate, regular sleep (interdaily stability and autocorrelation Zs ≈ +2; sleep duration Z ≈ +1.48), plus low depressive symptoms and average-to-low trait anxiety and relatively high self-esteem — these point toward lower PSS relative to their sample.
- For Participant 2: higher self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.3; r with PSS ≈ -0.68) and low emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z ≈ -0.97; r with PSS ≈ +0.72) are meaningful protective factors, but the most strongly predictive risk signals (sleep disruption, nocturnal arousal, and anxiety) are prominent.

Within-sample framing and comparative weighing
- Each description is explicitly written relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1’s overall profile is described as mixed but leaning toward near-to-slightly-below the study mean PSS (i.e., not clearly above their population mean). The strongest, most sample-relative indicators for P1 are protective (very high interdaily stability and autocorrelation; long, consistent sleep; low depression/anxiety).
- Participant 2’s profile is explicitly described as likely above their study mean PSS. The key drivers (very poor subjective sleep with a moderate correlation to PSS, objective extreme short/irregular sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, and moderate anxiety with a very strong correlation to PSS) are all factors that, in this cohort, are strongly linked to higher PSS.
- Importantly, the predictive strength of indicators differs: Participant 2’s anxiety measure (GAD-7) has a very large sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.78), and sleep disturbance similarly has moderate-to-large correlations (PSQI r ≈ 0.47). In contrast, Participant 1’s physiological indicator that points toward higher stress (RHR) has only a small sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), and the strongest signals for P1 are protective.

Conclusion (balance of evidence)
- Relative to their respective study populations, Participant 2 shows multiple, highly predictive signals that align with PSS being above their population mean (notably anxiety and severe sleep/circadian disruption with nocturnal HR arousal). Participant 1’s evidence is mixed but leans toward being at or slightly below their sample mean, driven by strong circadian regularity and low trait psychopathology.
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

5,95374,14,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe and objectively corroborated sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (disturbed), wearable median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h, and very large night-to-night sleep-start variability (start-time SD Z = +2.82). Sleep measures here have relatively strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ +0.50), so these extreme sleep abnormalities strongly favor higher PSS.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 (mild) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = +0.43; both measures show strong positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (GAD r ≈ +0.78; emotional lability r ≈ +0.68), giving these indicators high weight toward above-mean stress.
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: Substance Abuse Z ≈ +1.75 and pain-related measures that correlate positively with PSS—additional stress-related contributors.
- Circadian instability: Reduced interdaily stability and low rhythm amplitude (Zs ≈ -1.42 and -1.10) which correlate modestly with higher PSS.
- Protective factors that partially offset risk: very high generalized self-efficacy (NGSE Z = +1.79; r with PSS ≈ -0.63) and low resting HR/mesor (Zs ≈ -0.55/ -0.66). These moderate the signal but do not eliminate multiple, strongly PSS-correlated indicators (notably the severe sleep disruption and anxiety).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 28 (Z ≈ +1.53; CES-D r with PSS ≈ +0.29) and STAI Z ≈ +0.56 (r ≈ +0.31), both supporting above-mean stress.
- Poor subjective sleep and irregular/late sleep timing: PSQI = 9 (Z ≈ +1.05) plus very large night-to-night sleep-duration variability (duration SD Z ≈ +2.68) and late median sleep start (~03:11 AM, start-time SD Z ≈ +1.43). These objective/subjective sleep markers (though their correlations with PSS are more modest here) coherently point toward elevated perceived stress.
- Low reported happiness (Z ≈ -1.61) which correlates with higher PSS.
- Protective factors that reduce the net risk: low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.80), very strong and regular heart-rate circadian rhythm (amplitude Z ≈ +2.06; autocorrelation Z ≈ +1.06; interdaily stability Z ≈ +0.42) which correlate negatively with PSS, near-average total sleep time (≈7h15m), little substance use, higher self-esteem and social time. These are substantial buffers in this participant’s profile.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and number of high-PSS–correlated indicators: Participant 1 demonstrates multiple measures that both are extreme in magnitude (e.g., median sleep ≈ 3 h; sleep timing SD Z ≈ +2.82) and have strong sample correlations with PSS (GAD r ≈ +0.78; emotional lability r ≈ +0.68; PSQI r ≈ +0.50). Participant 2’s elevated measures (CES-D, STAI, PSQI, sleep variability) are meaningful but generally have smaller correlations with PSS in their sample (CES-D/STAI r ≈ +0.29–+0.31; sleep timing/variability r ≈ +0.15–+0.18).
- Extremity and directional coherence: Participant 1’s risky indicators are both extreme and directionally coherent (severe objective sleep loss + subjective disturbance + anxiety + substance problems), producing a strong net signal toward above-mean stress despite a major protective factor (high self-efficacy). Participant 2 shows a mixed profile with clear risk signals (depression, late/variable sleep) but also strong physiological circadian resilience and other behavioral protections that meaningfully offset risk.
- Population SD context: Participant 2’s population PSS SD is smaller (3.68) than Participant 1’s (7.38), so a given inferred deviation from mean might map to fewer absolute PSS points for Participant 2; however, the stronger, higher-correlation, and more extreme stress-related abnormalities in Participant 1 still favor a higher absolute inferred PSS.

Weighting the balance of evidence: Participant 1’s profile contains more extreme, highly PSS-correlated indicators (especially objectively documented severe sleep restriction/irregularity and anxiety-related measures) that outweigh its protective self-efficacy signal. Participant 2 has notable above-mean indicators but also several strong physiological and behavioral protections. Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

20,70125,21,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Elevated mood/anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 24 (Z ≈ +1.11, “Depressed”); STAI = 50 (Z ≈ +0.86, “anxious”). Both measures have modest positive correlations with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), making them the strongest psychosocial predictors in this description.
- Disturbed and irregular sleep: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), very late median sleep onset (~01:44), and high night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD Z ≈ +1.32). Sleep disturbance/variability correlate positively with PSS in the sample (though modestly).
- Reduced circadian regularity: lower interdaily stability, lower amplitude, and low 24-hour autocorrelation (Zs ~ -0.5 to -0.7), which in this cohort associate with higher PSS.
- Low social trust and lower health satisfaction (Zs negative), which can increase vulnerability to stress.
- Balance: Several risk signals point above-mean PSS, but their correlations with PSS in the cohort are modest. Protective factors (high self-esteem, above-average happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, low substance use) are present and have small-to-moderate negative associations with PSS, tempering the risk.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Elevated anxiety: GAD-7 = 10 (screening threshold), and in this cohort GAD-7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.77). This is a particularly strong predictor.
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 13.5 (very high) and short median recorded sleep (~3 h 55 m). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.49); very short sleep duration is also mechanistically linked to greater stress.
- Elevated pain and pain interference: PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86; both have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (~0.45–0.49).
- High emotional lability: BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9, with a strong positive correlation to PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.66).
- Circadian disruption: markedly reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -1.51) and lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.75), which modestly associate with higher PSS in this cohort.
- Balance: Notable protective factors include high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41; r with PSS ≈ -0.68), relatively low interpersonal problems, and lower resting HR (possible physiological buffer). However, several of the strongest predictors of PSS in this cohort (GAD-7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain measures) are elevated and have large correlations with PSS, giving substantial weight toward above-mean perceived stress.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s elevated measures are tied to predictors that have much larger correlations with PSS in their cohort (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; PSQI r ≈ 0.49) compared with Participant 1’s strongest predictors (CES-D and STAI with r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Stronger predictor correlations imply a given elevation translates to a larger expected increase in PSS.
- Severity/magnitude of symptoms: Participant 2 shows very severe subjective sleep problems (PSQI 13.5) and objectively short median sleep (<4 h), plus clinically meaningful anxiety and high pain interference—these are severe signals. Participant 1 has meaningful elevations in depressive and trait anxiety symptoms and substantial sleep variability, but those measures and their cohort-level associations are less pronounced than the strongest signals in Participant 2.
- Protective factors: Both participants have notable protective resources. Participant 1’s high self-esteem, regular exercise, and low resting HR mitigate some risk. Participant 2’s high self-efficacy and low interpersonal difficulty are protective and have large negative correlations with PSS (self-efficacy r ≈ -0.68), but in Participant 2 these protections appear to partially attenuate, not fully offset, multiple strong risk signals.
- Net evidence: Participant 1’s profile is mixed but leans above-mean primarily via moderate symptom elevations and circadian/sleep irregularity; correlations for these predictors are modest. Participant 2’s profile contains several high-impact risk indicators (anxiety, severe subjective sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability) that—given their large cohort correlations—are likely to produce a larger upward deviation from the cohort mean PSS than Participant 1’s pattern.

Conclusion
Given the relative strengths of predictors, the severity of sleep/anxiety/pain/emotional-lability signals in Participant 2, and the much larger cohort-level correlations linking those measures to PSS, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (larger above-mean deviation) than Participant 1.

6,56543,20,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Psychological symptom indicators above sample mean: elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 18, Z = 0.49). Both have positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28).
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05) and shorter-than-average median sleep duration (6 h 26 min, Z = -0.94), which tend to co-occur with higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated baseline autonomic activation: higher resting HR and MESOR (RHR Z ≈ 1.17; MESOR Z ≈ 1.14), which correlate positively (albeit modestly) with PSS (RHR r ≈ 0.13).
- Very large late-evening physiological arousal (especially a +44 bpm deviation at 10–11 pm, Z ≈ 5.94) and very late median sleep onset (~02:22), patterns compatible with behaviors that sustain stress and disrupted sleep.
- High daily internet use (>4 hours, Z = 2.19) and elevated intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ 0.32), both modestly associated with higher PSS in this dataset.

Reasons Participant 1 might not have extremely high PSS (protective factors)
- Regular exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.07) and absence of substance use (alcohol/drugs negative Z), both protective.
- Above-average interdaily stability (IS Z = 0.67), higher health satisfaction (Z = 0.88), and high leisure/reading (reading Z = 4.24) which correlate with lower PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report predictors that are highly correlated with PSS in this sample: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety; r ≈ 0.77 with PSS), elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z ≈ 0.93; r ≈ 0.67), and low general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.62; r ≈ -0.66). These are among the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS reported.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5; r ≈ 0.49), which is a strong correlate of higher PSS.
- Some somatic/functional burden (pain interference PEG-3 average 5.0; r ≈ 0.44) that typically raises stress appraisal.
- Wearable indicators consistent with elevated arousal: relatively high resting HR and MESOR (RHR Z ≈ 1.31; MESOR Z ≈ 1.19) and large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD Z ≈ 1.12), which are associated with stress-related schedule disruption.

Reasons Participant 2 might not have extremely high PSS (protective factors)
- Median nightly sleep duration ~7 h (Z ≈ 0.56), which can be restorative.
- Low intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ -1.20), modestly elevated circadian amplitude (Z ≈ 0.43), and positive autocorrelation at 24 h (Z ≈ 0.25) — indicators of consolidated rhythms and some regularity that can be protective.
- Wearable-derived hourly evening HR deviations in this dataset are negatively correlated with PSS (so those physiological features do not uniformly support higher PSS here); overall wearable–PSS correlations are heterogeneous.

Comparative weighing of evidence (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are characterized as above their respective study means in the summaries. Crucially, the quality and strength of predictors differ:
  - Participant 2’s top predictors are self-report measures that have very strong sample-level correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77, BASIS-24 r ≈ 0.67, NGSE r ≈ -0.66). These variables are direct, high-weight indicators of perceived stress in that dataset.
  - Participant 1 shows several risk signals (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor sleep, elevated resting HR/mesor, extreme late-evening HR spike) but the self-report predictors there have more modest correlations with PSS (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28), and there are clear behavioral protective factors (regular exercise, no substance use, high reading and IS) that partly offset risk.
- Although Participant 1 has an extreme physiological feature (very large evening HR deviation and very late sleep timing), the dataset-level links between those specific physiological patterns and PSS appear weaker or less direct than the very strong self-report–PSS associations observed for Participant 2.
- Participant 2’s constellation (moderate anxiety by GAD-7, very poor PSQI, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) comprises multiple, strongly PSS-associated self-reports; even with some physiological/behavioral resilience, these high-weight self-report predictors argue for a relatively higher perceived stress level.

Inference: which participant likely has higher perceived stress
- On balance, Participant 2’s profile contains more and stronger predictors (by sample-level correlations) of higher PSS than Participant 1’s profile. Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress relative to their study population.

17,90079,19,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Objective sleep restriction and variability: median sleep ~5 h 54 min (z = −1.59) and large sleep start-time SD (z ≈ 0.46). Short and variable sleep is associated with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Circadian disruption: low interdaily stability (z = −1.65) and elevated intradaily variability/fragmentation (z = 1.44), both of which correlate (albeit modestly) with PSS in this sample.
- Elevated resting HR: resting HR z = 0.89 and evening HR elevations are consistent with higher tonic arousal and correlate slightly with PSS (r ≈ 0.14).
- Day-to-day sleep duration variability (SD z ≈ 0.84) which can reflect irregular schedules linked to stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Severe anxiety: GAD‑7 = 16.5 (z = 1.25). In this study GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.81), making this a high-weight indicator of elevated perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 16 (z = 0.83), and PSQI correlates substantially with PSS (r ≈ 0.51).
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE z = −0.62 and NGSE correlates strongly negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.66), supporting higher stress.
- Pain/interference and emotional/functional disturbance (PEG/PAPAS, BASIS‑24 features) that correlate moderately with PSS and add psychosocial strain.
- Elevated physiological arousal: resting HR z = 1.53 and mesor z = 1.49, consistent with sustained arousal linked to higher PSS.
- Wearable sleep shows very short median sleep and late/irregular timing (median 2 h 31 min, sleep start SD z ≈ 0.98), which aligns with subjective reports of severe sleep disturbance (even while acknowledging possible wearable undercounting).

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Strength of evidence: Participant 2’s indicators include several high-weight self-report measures that are strongly correlated with PSS in their study (especially GAD‑7 and NGSE). Those measures provide direct, high-specificity evidence of elevated perceived stress in that population.
- Magnitude and convergence: Participant 2 shows convergence across high-correlation self-report measures (anxiety, PSQI, self-efficacy), physiological elevation (resting HR), and functional/pain measures — a multi-domain pattern that, given the study correlations, points strongly above their population mean.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are objective sleep and circadian markers (short sleep, low interdaily stability, high fragmentation) and modestly elevated resting HR. Those features are associated with higher PSS but with smaller correlations in that dataset; simultaneously, Participant 1’s depression and trait anxiety scores are near/below mean and substance use is low, which mitigate the inference of very high perceived stress.
- Measurement caveats: Participant 2’s wearable sleep duration looks implausibly short and could be an artifact, but the subjective PSQI strongly corroborates severe sleep problems, which preserves the weight of the sleep-related evidence.

Overall balance
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but Participant 2’s profile is more strongly and consistently indicative of elevated PSS given (a) severe self-reported anxiety and very poor subjective sleep that are highly correlated with PSS in that sample, (b) low self‑efficacy and pain interference that further predict higher PSS, and (c) elevated resting HR/mesor. Participant 1 shows moderate objective markers of stress (sleep/circadian disturbance and modestly higher HR) but lacks elevated self-reported anxiety/depression that would strongly push PSS much higher relative to their sample.

  - Poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 15.5 (Z ≈ 0.67); PSQI correlates r ≈ 0.53 with PSS in this sample.
  - High pain/functional interference: PAPAS = 81 (Z ≈ 0.93); PAPAS correlates r ≈ 0.53 with PSS.
  - Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -0.62; NGSE correlates r ≈ -0.69 with PSS (a strong inverse relationship).
- Physiological markers that align with higher PSS in the sample:
  - Elevated mesor and resting HR (Mesor Z ≈ 0.7; RHR Z ≈ 0.61).
  - Consistent nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–early morning deviations with Zs ≥ 0.55–1.38) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Behavioral/circadian dysregulation:
  - Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83), which has a small association with higher PSS.
- Net effect in the description: the integrative summary explicitly concludes perceived stress is likely above the population mean (Population mean = 21.29), with several moderately strong converging indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Several behavioral and subjective features associated with higher stress in this sample:
  - PSQI = 6 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep” despite long sleep duration).
  - Markedly delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:12) and high sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 146 min, Z ≈ 1.04).
  - Increased daytime napping (mean daily naps Z ≈ 2.66) and very high internet use (Z ≈ 2.19).
  - Low exercise participation (exercise Z ≈ -1.09 to -1.18).
  - Low reported trust (trust Z ≈ -2.07) and slightly reduced happiness (happiness Z ≈ -0.53).
  - Some circadian markers show only moderate day-to-day stability (autocorr 24h Z ≈ -0.36).
- Net effect in the description: these risk markers could elevate perceived stress, but the overall interpretation given is that PSS is likely near the population mean (Population mean = 21.61), not clearly above it.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Strength and consistency of risk signals:
  - Participant 1: multiple relatively large and converging indicators (subjective sleep, pain, low self-efficacy) that individually show moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample (notably NGSE r ≈ -0.69, PSQI/PAPAS r ≈ 0.53). Physiological HR signals also converge with those subjective markers.
  - Participant 2: several behavioral/chronobiological risk markers (late/irregular sleep, naps, high internet use), but several protective factors of substantial magnitude (low CES-D/STAI-T, high self-esteem, strong circadian amplitude, long median sleep duration, good academic performance). Some risk z-scores (napping, internet use) are large, but the participant’s strong protective profile leads the original interpretation to “near mean.”
- Relative implication for PSS:
  - Participant 1’s profile is described as “likely above” their population mean, with several variables that have moderate-to-strong sample-level correlations with PSS.
  - Participant 2’s profile is described as “near” their population mean because protective factors counterbalance the behavioral risks.

Conclusion
- Given the greater number and strength of converging indicators tied to higher PSS in their sample (subjective sleep disturbance, high pain/interference, low self-efficacy, and physiological nocturnal HR elevations), Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study population than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

21,82728,30,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) with late, variable bedtimes and a mismatch between wearable sleep duration and perceived sleep quality — known correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Lower positive affect and health satisfaction (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.45), which modestly associate with greater perceived stress.
- Small early-morning heart‑rate deviations (r ≈ 0.19–0.21) that correlate positively with PSS and could reflect subtle nocturnal/autonomic arousal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12; z ≈ 0.46) with a very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77)—a high-impact predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5; z ≈ 1.32) that also correlates with higher PSS.
- Large nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (several hourly HR z‑scores ≈ 0.7–1.0) that are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting disrupted autonomic recovery overnight.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24) that are associated with higher PSS; substance‑use subscale is notably high (z ≈ 1.5) and may reflect stress‑related behaviors.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each participant’s profile is already framed relative to their own population mean PSS: Participant 1 is described as near-to-slightly-below their population mean (21.61), while Participant 2 is described as above their population mean (20.67).
- The stress‑related signals for Participant 1 are generally modest and counterbalanced by strong protective markers (robust circadian rhythms, frequent exercise, low anxiety/depression, healthy behaviors). Net inference in their frame is near or slightly below mean PSS.
- Participant 2 exhibits several moderate-to-strong, convergent stress indicators (clinically meaningful anxiety, very high PSQI z, nighttime HR elevations, reduced self‑efficacy) whose correlations with PSS are large in this sample. Although there are some protective physiological signs (adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR), the high-impact psychological and nocturnal autonomic signals tilt the balance toward above‑mean PSS for their population.
- Because the descriptions are relative to different population means, absolute comparison could be ambiguous, but the direction and magnitude of deviations matter: Participant 2 shows multiple strong positive deviations on measures that correlate highly with PSS, whereas Participant 1 shows only modest stress signals largely outweighed by protective features.

Overall judgment
Given the stronger, convergent, and higher‑impact indicators of perceived stress in Participant 2 (notably elevated anxiety and very poor subjective sleep plus nocturnal autonomic arousal) versus the modest and largely offset stress signals in Participant 1, Participant 2 is more likely to have the higher PSS.

- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 6 (classified disturbed), which in the sample is associated with higher PSS.
- Shorter-than-average sleep duration: median ~6 h 46 min (Z ≈ -0.51), which can modestly increase stress vulnerability.
- Late and variable sleep timing: median sleep onset ~01:29 AM with moderate start-time variability (SD ≈ 88 min), modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Low frequency of physical exercise and limited socializing, behavioral risk factors that could elevate perceived stress (though their direct correlations with PSS in this sample are small).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = 0.83) and PSQI has a relatively strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58).
- Very short wearable-recorded median sleep (1 hr 44 min, Z ≈ -1.24) and high sleep start-time variability (SD ≈ 160 min), supporting substantial objective/subjective sleep disruption (even allowing for potential non-wear bias).
- Elevated pain and activity interference: PEG-3 average 7.78 (Z ≈ 0.71) and PAPAS 78.0 (Z ≈ 0.8); both moderately positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal HR deviations (midnight–early morning) consistent with nocturnal arousal that correlate positively with PSS (small-to-moderate correlations).

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is written relative to its own cohort mean. Participant 1’s integrated assessment is that their profile is predominantly protective and therefore most consistent with a PSS below their population mean (population mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). Although there are modest sleep and lifestyle risk signals, they are smaller in magnitude and less strongly correlated with PSS than the robust protective signals (very low depressive and anxiety scores, high well-being, strong circadian regularity, low-normal resting HR).
- Participant 2’s integrated assessment is mixed but leans toward PSS near or modestly above their population mean (population mean = 21.5, SD = 7.16). The strongest upward drivers are very elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) and elevated pain/interference—both moderate-to-strong correlates of PSS in this sample. These risk signals are partly offset by low recent anxiety, good self-efficacy, and robust circadian/cardiac markers, but the sleep/pain signals are substantial and specifically tied to higher PSS.
- Comparing the two within their respective cohort frames: Participant 1 is characterized as below their cohort mean with mostly strong protective indicators; Participant 2 is characterized as near-to-slightly-above their cohort mean with several moderate-to-strong risk indicators (notably PSQI and pain). The magnitude and strength of P2’s sleep and pain signals (which have sizable correlations with PSS) outweigh P1’s weaker risk signals.

Given the balance of evidence and the within-cohort comparisons, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

9,23287,12,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; described as “Disturbed Sleep”), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r = 0.46), supporting a link between worse sleep and higher perceived stress.
- Very short objective nightly sleep (median 3 h 27 min) and high night-to-night sleep variability — severe sleep restriction is a strong behavioral stressor.
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity/circadian rhythm (value = 0.64, Z = 2.29), indicating fragmentation that in the sample trends toward higher PSS.
- Increased mean daily naps (0.4/day, Z = 1.24), which may reflect daytime sleepiness/compensation and is associated with elevated PSS in the cohort.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 relationships subscale), which could contribute psychosocial stress (even if its correlation with PSS is small in this sample).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Slightly elevated intradaily variability (value 0.57, z ≈ 0.17) and some sleep-duration variability (SD z ≈ 0.67), both modestly positively correlated with PSS.
- Elevated nap frequency (0.25 naps/day, z = 2.07), which in this sample has a modest positive correlation with PSS.
- Limited time socializing with friends (z = -1.41), reducing social buffering against stress.
- Higher daily internet use (3–4 hrs, z = 1.52), which shows a small positive association with PSS in the cohort.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate increases (up to z ~2.37) that could reflect evening arousal/rumination; hourly deviations are weakly correlated with PSS but represent a potential vulnerability.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s population context)
- Both participant profiles are described as overall below their respective population mean PSS, but the balance of evidence differs in strength and quality.
- Participant 2’s profile has multiple, large-magnitude protective indicators strongly consistent with lower perceived stress: very low resting HR and mesor (z ≈ -2.1), very good subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ -1.72), long objective sleep duration (z ≈ +1.49), low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, regular circadian metrics, low substance use, and high health satisfaction. Most countervailing signals for Participant 2 are small in magnitude and only modestly correlated with PSS in that cohort.
- Participant 1’s profile is more mixed: strong protective signals exist (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability — all of which have strong sample-level associations with lower PSS), but there are prominent, potentially impactful sleep-related risk factors (severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance and high intradaily variability). The sleep signals for Participant 1 are directly and meaningfully associated with higher PSS in that sample (notably PSQI r ≈ 0.46), making them influential despite other protective factors.
- Overall, Participant 2 presents a coherently low-stress profile with only minor risk indicators, whereas Participant 1 presents a conflicted profile in which severe sleep disruption (a moderately strong predictor of PSS in that sample) offsets several protective factors.

- Self-report measures strongly linked to PSS in this sample:
  - Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) — GAD-7 has the strongest sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.77), so even a moderate GAD score is an important contributor.
  - Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r = 0.49).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 score; z = 0.93; r = 0.67).
  - Lower general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62; NGSE r = -0.66).
  - Pain interference and modest somatic burden (PEG-3 average 5.0; r = 0.44).
- Wearable/behavioral signals consistent with elevated stress:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ 1.2–1.3).
  - Large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.12).
  - Late sleep timing (median start ~23:34).
- Contraindications are present but weaker relative to the strong self-report predictors:
  - Median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h and low intradaily variability (z = -1.20) suggest some circadian consolidation and partial resilience, but these are described as tempering rather than overruling the self-report signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Risk factors that could increase perceived stress:
  - Very high sedentary/screen time (large positive Zs for video games, TV, internet use).
  - Late median sleep start (~01:04 AM) which can be associated with social/scheduling strain.
  - Elevated heart-rate mesor/amplitude (mesor z ≈ 1.35; amplitude z ≈ 1.72) and somewhat low exercise frequency.
  - Low social-trust score (z = -2.39), a potential interpersonal vulnerability.
- However, these risk factors are described as smaller in magnitude and less predictive of PSS in this sample than the protective signals (see below).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (within their study frame)
- Strong and consistent protective signals:
  - Very low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0; z = -1.38) and very low trait anxiety (STAI-Trait z = -2.11) — both correlate positively with PSS, so these are strong negative predictors of PSS here.
  - High self-esteem and momentary happiness (z = 1.1 and 1.64).
  - Good subjective sleep (PSQI = 3; z = -1.72) and low night-to-night sleep variability (z = -1.48).
  - Very strong circadian regularity: interdaily stability z = 2.4, 24-h autocorrelation z = 2.24, and very low intradaily variability z = -2.29 — these are large-magnitude signals associated with lower PSS.
- The summary explicitly concludes this participant is below the study mean PSS and likely nearer the lower quartile.

Comparative, within-sample weighing of evidence
- Each description is relative to its own population mean. Participant 1 is characterized primarily by multiple self-report indicators that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (especially GAD-7, emotional lability, and self-efficacy), and several wearable measures that align with higher stress; the write-up concludes P1 is above their sample mean (21.08).
- Participant 2, despite some behavioral risks (high screen time, late sleep timing, modestly elevated HR measures), has several very strong protective signals (near-zero depression, very low trait anxiety, high circadian regularity) with large z-scores and is concluded to be below their sample mean (21.64).
- The strongest predictors of PSS in these summaries are the self-report mental-health measures and sleep/circadian indices. Participant 1 exhibits multiple moderately-to-strongly positive predictors of higher PSS; Participant 2 exhibits several strongly negative predictors of PSS. Even though some of Participant 1’s physiological z-scores are ~1, Participant 2’s protective z-scores are often larger in magnitude (e.g., STAI z ≈ -2.11, interdaily stability z ≈ +2.4), indicating a clearer position below their mean.

Overall determination
- Given that Participant 1 is described as above their population mean PSS with multiple strong positive predictors (particularly anxiety, poor subjective sleep, emotional lability, and low self-efficacy) and Participant 2 is described as below their population mean with several strong protective signals, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale Z = +0.53; r = 0.65 with PSS) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8.5; r = 0.55), both strongly associated with higher PSS in that sample.  
- Elevated pain/interference measures (PEG-3, PAPAS Z = +1.21) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (midnight–2am deviations Z ≈ +1.25–1.36) that have substantial positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Although there are protective factors (high self-efficacy, robust circadian regularity, low resting HR, low substance use), the strongest survey and nocturnal physiological predictors in this dataset point clearly toward above-mean PSS.

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective study means.  
- The key difference is predictor strength: Participant 2’s primary indicators (GAD-7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain measures, nocturnal HR) have substantially stronger sample-level correlations with PSS (many r’s in the 0.4–0.77 range). These are direct, high-weight predictors of perceived stress in Participant 2’s study.  
- Participant 1 shows multiple stress-consistent signals (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening HR deviations), but the sample-level correlations tying those measures to PSS are generally smaller (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31; PSQI and physiological measures smaller or modest). Some strong protective behavioral/contextual factors (high interpersonal trust, frequent exercise, good self-rated physical health) are present and may meaningfully moderate P1’s overall perceived stress.  
- Given that Participant 2’s elevated measures are both clinically notable and are among the strongest correlates of PSS in that dataset (particularly GAD-7), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely farther above their population mean PSS than Participant 1 is above theirs.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 12 (clinically disturbed sleep), and PSQI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r = 0.50). This is a direct self-report indicator that commonly tracks with higher perceived stress.
- Emotional dysregulation: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability = 8.33 (z = 0.53) and a strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.65), indicating mood instability likely contributes to perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: marked night-hour HR elevations (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), and an elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = 1.37, mesor z = 1.18) that together suggest reduced overnight recovery and sustained sympathetic tone linked to higher PSS.
- Very long median sleep duration and very high night-to-night variability (z-scores ≈ +2.3), which, although weakly correlated with PSS in this dataset, are behaviorally/physiologically consistent with dysregulation that can accompany stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not elevated) PSS (protective evidence)
- Low pain burden and interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS z ≈ -1.2 to -1.4), and these pain measures correlate positively with PSS in the sample, so lower pain is protective.
- Relatively intact interpersonal functioning (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z ≈ -1.77), which tends to buffer stress.
- Low substance-related problems and only mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 6; z ≈ -0.59), whereas GAD correlates strongly with PSS, but this participant’s anxiety is below average.
- Several circadian metrics and many wearable features have weak correlations with PSS in this sample, reducing confidence that physiological circadian irregularities alone imply above-average PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in the description)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 21, z = 0.8, classified “Depressed”) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86). Both are established positive correlates of PSS (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Low self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ -1.29), and self‑esteem is negatively correlated with PSS in the sample, so low self‑esteem aligns with higher perceived stress.
- Marginally disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6) plus objective circadian/activity markers of instability: high intradaily variability (z = 1.09), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (z ≈ -0.53), nontrivial sleep timing variability, and slightly short median sleep — these features (some with positive sample correlations to PSS) point toward higher perceived stress.
- The study summary explicitly concludes the participant’s profile is “likely above the study population mean” for PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or mitigated) PSS (protective evidence)
- Frequent exercise and sports (z ≈ 1.07–1.58), generally associated with reduced stress and resilience.
- No substance use (removes a common risk pathway).
- Low resting heart rate (54.6 bpm; z ≈ -0.42), indicative of better baseline cardiovascular fitness/resilience.
- Self‑reported happiness above the mean (z ≈ 0.55), a correlate of lower PSS.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1’s profile is explicitly characterized as near that study mean (Population mean 20.96) with some domain-specific elevations (sleep disturbance, emotional lability, nocturnal HR), but several protective domains that counterbalance those risks. The summary overall endorses a near-mean PSS rather than a clear above-mean score.
- Participant 2’s profile is explicitly characterized as likely above that study mean (Population mean 21.59). Multiple, convergent self-report measures (depression, trait anxiety, low self‑esteem) that are known correlates of PSS together with circadian fragmentation consistently point toward above-average perceived stress for that participant. While Participant 2 also has clear protective behaviors (regular exercise, low resting HR, no substance use), the summary judges the net balance to favor a moderate elevation in PSS.
- Strength of signals: Participant 1 has some strong physiological signals (nocturnal HR, elevated resting HR) and a strong correlation of emotional lability with PSS, but protective self-report domains (low pain, good interpersonal function, mild anxiety) and the study’s own conclusion place this person near their population mean. Participant 2 shows multiple concordant clinical-symptom signals (depression, trait anxiety, low self‑esteem) that directly and consistently point to above-mean PSS in that sample; the study summary also classifies Participant 2 as above-mean.
- The two study populations’ means differ only slightly (20.96 vs 21.59), so population baseline differences are small and unlikely to reverse the comparative judgment based on the participants’ relative positions to their own means.

Conclusion
- On balance, Participant 2 has a clearer, more consistent multimodal pattern indicating elevated perceived stress relative to their study population, while Participant 1’s mixed profile is judged near their population mean. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

8,37218,20,14,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated affective symptom measures that correlate with PSS: CES‑D Z ≈ +1.11 (depressive symptoms) and STAI‑trait Z ≈ +0.76 (trait anxiety).
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52) combined with objectively short median sleep (Z ≈ -1.45) and very late sleep timing (~03:56 AM) — sleep features that are robustly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Objective circadian/physiological signs consistent with stress: reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.63), some intradaily fragmentation, and late‑night HR elevation (nocturnal arousal signal).
- Behavioral inactivity (no regular exercise) which typically co-occurs with higher stress.
- These risk factors are only partially offset by protective features (no substance use, good GPA, some interdaily stability), so the integrated inference was PSS above the population mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly predictive self-report features relative to this sample: GAD‑7 (8) where anxiety→PSS correlation is very large (r = 0.77); elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = +0.63) and low self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44) — these measures have high correlations with PSS in this dataset.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) plus objectively very short median nightly sleep (1 h 39 min; Z ≈ -1.27) and very late sleep onset (~04:36 AM). Napping is elevated (Z ≈ +1.24).
- Multiple wearable-derived physiological and circadian abnormalities with sizable deviations: resting HR Z ≈ +1.19 and MESOR Z ≈ +1.24 (tonic cardiovascular activation), reduced diurnal amplitude Z ≈ -1.05, high intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.07, and pronounced early‑morning HR elevations — all patterns that, in this sample, align strongly with higher PSS.
- Pain/interference also contributes moderately to PSS (PEG and PAPAS correlations).
- Mitigating notes: anxiety level is only mild, substance‑use scores are low, and some wearable→PSS correlations are mixed; wearable sleep metric may be affected by recording artifacts (noted in caveats).

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means (P1 > 21.63; P2 > 21.08), but the strength and relevance of indicators differ.
- Participant 1’s strongest deviations are elevated PSQI (Z ≈ +1.52), CES‑D (Z ≈ +1.11), and short sleep duration (Z ≈ -1.45). However, many of the affective and physiological correlations with PSS in Participant 1’s summary are modest (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32).
- Participant 2 shows multiple measures with both sizable z‑score deviations and high sample correlations with PSS: anxiety (GAD‑7) is highly predictive (r = 0.77), emotional lability and self‑efficacy have strong correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.66 and -0.65), and several physiological/circadian metrics have large z deviations (MESOR/RHR ≈ +1.2; amplitude ≈ -1.05; IV ≈ +1.07). In other words, Participant 2 not only deviates on many fronts but those fronts are among the most strongly linked to PSS in that study.
- While Participant 1 has important risk signals (notably depressed mood and poor sleep), Participant 2’s profile contains a broader set of convergent, high‑correlation predictors (anxiety, affective lability, low self‑efficacy, pronounced physiological arousal and circadian disruption) and multiple z‑scores ≥ |1.0|.

Overall judgement
- Balancing number, magnitude, and the strength of correlation with PSS, Participant 2 presents a more pervasive and strongly predictive set of indicators of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1. Even allowing for caveats about possible wearable artifacts and the “mild” absolute GAD‑7, the convergent self‑report and physiological signals (many of which have large sample correlations with PSS) favor Participant 2 as having the higher PSS relative to their study population.

25,87328,21,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) — a self-report signal that commonly increases perceived stress (though here PSQI correlation with PSS is modest).
- Late median sleep onset (01:26 AM) and elevated nap rate (Z = 1.21) — timing/compensatory sleep patterns that weakly correlate with higher PSS in the sample.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (6–7 PM deviation Z ≈ 2.6) — could reflect sustained evening arousal that sometimes associates with greater stress.
- Lower health satisfaction (Z = -1.20) — a weakly correlated self-appraisal that can contribute to stress.

Notes on weight: these elevating factors are present but generally have modest correlations with PSS in the sample, and several are small in magnitude (e.g., PSQI Z = 0.13). They are outweighed in the profile by multiple strong protective indicators (very low CES‑D and STAI, high self‑esteem/happiness, strong circadian amplitude, low resting HR, high socializing), which is why the description infers PSS below that study’s mean (21.63).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS:
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6). GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.78), making this a highly salient contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Pain interference (PEG ≈ 6.78) and activity/pain-related burden (PAPAS z ≈ 0.24); these measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).
- Circadian irregularity and very high sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.7; interdaily stability z = -0.68; low 24-h autocorrelation) — objective patterns commonly linked to higher stress.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = 0.54).

Notes on weight: There are protective factors (self-efficacy z = 0.3, strong negative correlation with PSS r ≈ -0.65; no substance problems), but several of the participant’s top predictors (GAD‑7, PSQI, pain metrics, circadian irregularity) are strongly and directly associated with higher PSS. The study summary concludes this participant is likely slightly above their population mean (21.04).

Comparative, within-population reasoning and overall judgment:
- Each summary is calibrated to its own study mean. Participant 1 is characterized primarily by strong protective psychosocial and physiological markers and is inferred to be below their population mean (21.63). The features that could raise stress for Participant 1 are weaker predictors in this dataset.
- Participant 2 shows multiple features that are both elevated relative to their sample and are among the most strongly correlated predictors of PSS in that study (notably GAD‑7 with r = 0.78, and PSQI with r ≈ 0.49), producing an inference of PSS at or modestly above their study mean (21.04).
- Given the relative strength and number of stress-linked signals in Participant 2 (including a very strongly PSS-associated anxiety score and substantial subjective sleep disturbance), versus the predominance of strong protective signals in Participant 1, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely has the higher perceived stress.

20,92412,21,16,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (as described, relative to their study population)
- Elevated intradaily variability (0.66; Z = 0.81) — indicates more fragmentation between rest and activity and has a modest positive correlation with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.17).
- Moderately low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = -0.28) and only moderate interdaily stability (Z = 0.17) — suggest less rigid circadian structure, which can be associated with some day-to-day stress or routine variability.
- Large positive evening heart-rate deviations (especially 5–6 PM; Z = 4.19) and generally elevated evening HR — could reflect sustained physiological arousal that, in some contexts, relates to poorer wind-down and higher stress (though here likely driven by late exercise).
- Small positive correlations between some nighttime-to-morning HR deviations and PSS — weak signals consistent with slightly elevated stress for some nights.

(Also note strong protective signals for P1: very low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, high momentary happiness, good subjective sleep, regular exercise, low resting HR, pronounced nocturnal HR nadirs, and stable adequate sleep — overall these dominate the small risk signals.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (as described, relative to their study population)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) — flagged as clinically meaningful and strongly correlated with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.77). This is a major predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) — strongly associated with higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.49).
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86) — both correlate moderately-to-strongly with PSS (~0.45–0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9) — large positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Circadian/sleep physiology consistent with stress risk: very short median recorded sleep (~3 h 55 m), reduced circadian amplitude (Z = -1.51), and low interdaily stability (Z = -0.75) — each modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Hourly HR deviations consistent with compressed/shifted rest-activity and flattened diurnal range.

(Protective signals for P2: high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 1.41) which strongly negatively correlates with PSS (r ≈ -0.68), relatively low interpersonal problems, and lower resting HR — these attenuate but do not negate the multiple strong risk signals.)

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each participant’s description is interpreted relative to their own study’s PSS distribution. Participant 1’s profile is dominated by multiple strong protective indicators (large negative/deviation Z-scores on depression and trait anxiety, good sleep quality, high happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR and robust nocturnal recovery), while the risk signals reported are few and modest in magnitude (intradaily variability, circadian looseness, evening HR spikes likely tied to exercise).
- Participant 2 shows multiple, substantial risk indicators that in this cohort have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77, PSQI r ≈ 0.49, emotional lability r ≈ 0.66, pain measures r ≈ 0.45–0.49). Those elevated scores are described as clinically meaningful (e.g., GAD-7 = 10, PSQI very high) and are supported by concordant wearable signals (short sleep, low amplitude, low stability).
- The magnitudes of the predictors matter: Participant 1’s few risk signals are small and plausibly explainable by healthy behaviors (exercise), whereas Participant 2’s risk signals are numerous, stronger, and include both psychological symptoms and disturbed sleep/pain that have strong sample-level associations with higher PSS.
- Therefore, even accounting for the different study means (P1 population mean = 21.63; P2 population mean = 21.04), the within-population evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to sit above their study’s mean PSS, while Participant 1 is likely below theirs. The balance of evidence points to Participant 2 having the worse (higher) perceived stress profile.

- High anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) and very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).  
- Marked objective sleep disruption: PSQI = 13, median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 19 min (Z = -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (start-time SD Z = 1.16) — all features that strongly align with higher perceived stress.  
- Nighttime physiological arousal: elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations (+8–9 bpm at 12–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS, elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability — a constellation indicating arousal/ rhythm disruption linked to higher stress.  
- Elevated emotional lability and pain/interference (BASIS-24, PEG-3, PAPAS) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Although a modest protective factor exists (slightly higher self-efficacy), multiple strong and convergent indicators tied to PSS favor an above-mean PSS inference.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep complaints: PSQI = 8 (disturbed sleep), which often associates with higher perceived stress despite adequate objective sleep.  
- Some physiological fragmentation and episodic arousal: elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.95) and pronounced hourly heart-rate peaks (midday and 10–11 pm; Z ≈ 2.1–3.1) that could indicate intermittent stress-related arousal.  
- Slightly lower momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which is modestly associated with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing the evidence
- Both descriptions are given relative to their own sample means (P1 population mean PSS = 21.17; P2 population mean PSS = 21.64). Each participant’s profile should be interpreted within that frame.  
- Participant 1 shows multiple, strongly convergent indicators that are known in this dataset to correlate substantially with PSS (notably high GAD-7 with r = 0.80, extreme objective sleep deprivation, nighttime HR elevations, and rhythm fragmentation). The magnitude and consistency of these signals strongly point to perceived stress above their population mean.  
- Participant 2 shows a mixture: strong protective signals (very low trait depression and trait anxiety, high self-esteem, long and regular objective sleep, low resting HR, good circadian stability) that are consistently associated with lower PSS in this sample. The countervailing signals for P2 (PSQI = 8, intradaily variability, isolated HR peaks) are more circumscribed and episodic and are weakerly correlated with PSS in this dataset. Overall evidence for elevated PSS in P2 is modest compared with P1’s multiple, high-magnitude indicators.  
- The small difference in population mean PSS values (21.17 vs 21.64) does not change the pattern: relative to their respective cohorts, P1 is characterized by substantially stronger and more pervasive stress-linked features than P2.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of evidence, Participant 1 is much more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Nighttime physiological arousal: marked nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (+8.6 to +9.0 bpm at midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42). Resting HR elevated (81.23 bpm, Z = +1.67).

- Additional stress‑linked signals: elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24), pain/interference (PEG‑3/PAPAS) correlated with PSS.  
- Protective factor present but small: modestly higher self‑efficacy (Z = +0.12) which likely does not offset the above strong signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Sleep and anxiety signals: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), STAI‑Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27), later sleep timing and moderately shortened sleep (median ~6 h 51 min; z ≈ −0.42). These correlate positively with PSS.  
- Some physiological activation: resting HR and mesor modestly elevated (z ≈ +0.7–0.8). High evening internet use (z ≈ +2.19) that can worsen sleep and stress.  
- However, several mitigators: low depressive symptoms (CES‑D low), fairly high interdaily stability/autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.8) indicating preserved regularity, limited substance use, social/exercise engagement, and maintained academic performance. Many of Participant 2’s risk signals are modest in magnitude and counterbalanced by protective factors.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are characterized as above their respective study means, but the magnitude and concentration of stress‑linked signals differ. Participant 1 shows multiple large deviations on metrics that have strong sample‑level associations with PSS (notably GAD‑7, extremely short/irregular objective sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, and circadian flattening). Several of these deviations are relatively large Z scores (e.g., resting HR Z ≈ +1.67; amplitude Z ≈ −1.57) and include objective physiological extremes (2+ hour sleep deficit vs typical), which strongly favor a higher PSS inference.  
- Participant 2’s elevations are generally more moderate (PSQI and some HR indices elevated but smaller Zs), and important protective factors (low depressive symptoms, high interdaily stability, good functioning) counterbalance the risk signals, making a more modest net elevation above that sample mean.  
- The strength of sample correlations is also relevant: P1’s high GAD‑7 (strong predictor, r = 0.80) and nocturnal HR deviations with moderate correlations strengthen the case that P1’s pattern maps to higher perceived stress in that cohort than P2’s pattern maps to higher stress in their cohort.

Balanced judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is likely experiencing a worse overall perceived stress profile than Participant 2 (i.e., a higher PSS relative to their respective samples), because P1’s deviations are larger, involve stronger predictors of PSS, and include more extreme objective physiological/sleep dysregulation that align with elevated perceived stress.

Nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–2 AM +8–9 bpm) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Pain/functional interference that correlates with PSS (PEG‑3/PAPAS measures; r ≈ 0.47).  
- Although there is a modest protective factor (self‑efficacy Z = 0.12), the combination of anxiety, severe sleep loss/variability, nocturnal arousal, and pain are multiple, convergent indicators that in this cohort are strongly associated with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their population mean)
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity and fragmentation: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.07), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z = −0.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74), and attenuated amplitude (Z = −1.03). These features in the sample are modestly associated with higher PSS.  
- Some hourly HR deviations (e.g., early-morning elevations and a pronounced morning peak with Z = 3.07 at 6–7am) that show small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23), which could reflect schedule-related or morning-arousal stressors.

Reasons Participant 2 is likely to have lower PSS (important counterbalance)
- Strong, consistent self-report indicators of low stress and good well‑being: Trait anxiety STAI Z = −1.71, CES‑D Z = −1.07, high happiness (Z = 1.64), high health satisfaction (Z = 2.05), and elevated self‑esteem (Z = 1.24). These directly map onto lower perceived stress.  
- Favorable sleep and behavior: long median sleep (8 h 11 m, Z = 1.25), good PSQI (score = 5), frequent exercise (Zs > 1), low substance use and low sedentary/screen time.  
- Physiological markers consistent with lower tonic arousal: low resting HR (Z = −0.65), lower mesor (Z = −0.81).  
- The circadian irregularity signals that point toward higher stress are modest in effect and are outweighed by multiple, large-magnitude protective self‑report and behavioral indicators.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1: Multiple high‑signal indicators that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (especially GAD‑7 r = 0.80 and sleep/circadian disruptions with moderate correlations) point to PSS above the study mean (mean = 21.17). The physiological and behavioral deviations are large in magnitude (several |Z| ≈ 1–1.6), and they converge on the same inference.  
- Participant 2: Self-report and behavioral signals consistently indicate PSS below that study’s mean (mean = 21.65), with several large-magnitude protective Z scores (STAI −1.71, health satisfaction +2.05, sleep +1.25). The wearable circadian irregularities that could raise PSS are present but smaller in their predictive strength and effect size relative to the strong self‑report evidence of low stress.

Overall balance of evidence and conclusion
- Participant 1 presents a clearer, convergent profile of higher perceived stress relative to their cohort (strong anxiety, extreme sleep loss/variability, nocturnal physiological arousal, pain), with several measures that in this sample show relatively large correlations with PSS.  
- Participant 2 presents a primarily low‑stress profile relative to their cohort (low trait anxiety/depression, high well‑being, good sleep and health behaviors); circadian irregularities introduce some ambiguity but are smaller and less persuasive than the robust protective signals.

  - Pronounced early-morning heart-rate elevations (1–8 AM) that map positively to PSS in the sample.
- Objective sleep behavior consistent with stress:
  - Extremely short median nightly sleep (median ≈ 1 hr 39 min, Z ≈ -1.27) and very late sleep timing (~04:36 AM), plus napping—consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and reduced downregulation.
- Balance and strengths of evidence:
  - Multiple independent, relatively strongly correlated indicators point above the study mean (21.08). Several of these indicators have large correlations with PSS in this dataset, strengthening the inference.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Self-report and affective indicators:
  - Trait anxiety (STAI = 41) has a positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31); while STAI is only modestly elevated, it is a risk factor.
  - Very low momentary happiness (Z ≈ -1.61) which correlates (negatively) with PSS and may reflect greater subjective distress.
  - Mild depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10) could contribute to perceived stress vulnerability.
- Behavioral / circadian sleep features that could raise stress:
  - Late sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:50) and somewhat reduced sleep duration (median ≈ 6 h 46 m, Z ≈ -0.51) — late timing and <7 h sleep can impair coping and increase perceived stress for some.
  - Slightly elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (Z ≈ 0.32) with a small positive correlation to PSS.
  - Some behavioral patterns (high video-game time) that might co-occur with stress or reduced recovery.
- Balance and strengths of evidence:
  - These risk signals are present but generally modest in magnitude and the correlations with PSS are smaller than the strongest correlates observed for Participant 1.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is described as likely above their study mean (PSS mean = 21.08), with several high-correlation predictors (GAD r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66; self-efficacy r = -0.65; PSQI r = 0.49) and concordant wearable signals (elevated RHR/MESOR, blunted amplitude, nocturnal HR elevations, extremely short/late sleep).
- Participant 2 is described as near to modestly below their study mean (PSS mean = 21.63). Although there are some subjective indicators of distress (modest trait anxiety, very low momentary happiness), objective physiology and rhythm measures are protective (high interdaily stability Z ≈ +0.9, low resting HR Z ≈ -1.18, PSQI ≈ 5).
- Magnitude and coherence: Participant 1’s elevated indicators are both more numerous and include measures with larger correlations to PSS; Participant 2’s risk indicators are weaker and are counterbalanced (and in several cases outweighed) by strong protective physiological/circadian markers.
- Population-mean context: Both population means are similar (21.08 vs 21.63). Within their respective frames, P1 is above their mean while P2 is at or slightly below theirs. That pattern implies P1 is more likely to have a higher absolute PSS than P2.

Weighing the overall evidence
- The evidence for elevated perceived stress is stronger, more consistent, and includes higher-correlation predictors for Participant 1 than for Participant 2.
- Participant 2 presents mixed signals but overall leans toward resilience or near-mean stress, whereas Participant 1 displays multiple converging indicators of elevated stress (subjective and physiological).

- Low generalized self‑efficacy: NGSE = 27 (Z = -0.62), and NGSE correlates inversely with PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Pain and functional interference: PEG ~5.8 and PAPAS 61 (correlations with PSS ≈ 0.44–0.48) — additional contributors to perceived stress.
- Elevated physiological arousal: resting HR 79.8 bpm (Z ≈ 1.53) and mesor 88.5 (Z ≈ 1.49), consistent with sustained arousal and higher stress.
- Very short and irregular wearable sleep: median recorded sleep ~2 h 31 min (Z ≈ -0.97), late median sleep start (~01:37) and high sleep-start SD (254 min, Z ≈ 0.98), concordant with high PSQI and stress.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Participant 1 shows a mixed profile: notable sleep/circadian risk signals and somewhat reduced positive affect, but several protective/neutral features (low resting HR and mesor, regular exercise, low depressive symptoms, high self-rated health). The summary explicitly places P1 near the sample mean PSS (21.61) with a modest tilt toward slightly above average.
- Participant 2 shows multiple strong, converging indicators that are highly predictive of PSS in their sample: severe anxiety (the single strongest correlate), very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy, pain interference, and elevated resting HR/mesor. Several of these indicators have large effect-size correlations with PSS in the study (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.81, NGSE r ≈ -0.66), and many of P2’s z-scores indicate substantial deviation from their sample mean in the high-stress direction.
- Weighing evidence: P1’s risk signals are mainly sleep/circadian irregularity and somewhat lower positive affect but are counterbalanced by strong physiological and behavioral protective markers. P2’s risk signals are numerous, cross-modal (self-report, physiological, functional), include very large correlates of PSS, and are less counterbalanced by protective features. The interpreter for P2 explicitly concluded PSS above their sample mean (21.12); the interpreter for P1 concluded near mean with a modest tilt upward.

Conclusion
Given the relative strengths, number, and predictive weight of indicators in each case, Participant 2 is much more likely to exhibit a higher perceived stress score than Participant 1.

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 24; Z ≈ +1.11) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; positively correlated with PSS in the sample). These affective scores co-occur with higher PSS.
- Objective sleep disturbance pattern: short median sleep (6h38m, Z = −0.69), very large night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD Z = +3.21) and irregular/late sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:07, start-time SD Z = +1.54). Sleep variability/timing are positively associated with PSS in the dataset.
- Subjective reductions in positive affect (lower happiness, slightly lower self‑esteem) that align with depressive/anxiety elevations and with higher perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate deviations modestly associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.21), supporting a link between physiology and stress.

Protective/mitigating factors noted for Participant 1 (reduce likelihood of very high PSS): frequent exercise, social activity, very low substance use, relatively intact circadian stability and distinct daytime/nighttime HR amplitude. The profile is mixed but the combination of affective elevations plus pronounced sleep irregularity tilts toward above‑mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; “Disturbed Sleep”), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42). This subjective sleep complaint is a plausible source of elevated perceived stress.
- Some early‑morning HR deviations that have small‑to‑moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).

Strong evidence against higher PSS in Participant 2 (make below‑mean PSS more likely): very high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.79; NGSE–PSS r = −0.60), minimal generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 Z ≈ −1.38; GAD–PSS r = +0.75), low emotional/interpersonal distress, very high interdaily stability and amplitude, and very low resting heart rate (RHR Z ≈ −2.23). These strong, highly correlated indicators point toward below‑mean perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1: Multiple stress‑associated signals (moderate affective symptom elevations, extreme sleep variability, late timing, subjective lowered positive affect), some of which show moderate sample correlations with PSS; overall the summary explicitly concludes “moderately above the population mean” (mean = 21.63).
- Participant 2: The dominant and highly weighted indicators (very high self‑efficacy, minimal anxiety, strong circadian rhythm, very low RHR) are strongly associated with lower PSS in that sample and the summary explicitly concludes “below the study sample mean” (mean = 21.5). The main counter‑signal (PSQI) is isolated and weaker in overall weight.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The number, magnitude, and extremity of stress‑linked indicators are greater for Participant 1 (notably affective symptoms plus extreme sleep variability) than for Participant 2, whose strongest signals point toward low stress and whose only substantive risk indicator is subjective sleep complaints.
- Both reports are already calibrated relative to their own cohort means; Participant 1 is characterized as moderately above their population mean, whereas Participant 2 is characterized as below theirs. Comparing within those frames, Participant 1 displays a higher overall likelihood of elevated perceived stress.

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D z = 0.28), and CES‑D is positively correlated with PSS in the sample.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), which is associated with higher PSS even though objective sleep time is adequate.  
- Circadian fragmentation and schedule irregularity (intradaily variability z = 0.74; interdaily stability z = -0.49), with intradaily variability positively correlated with PSS.  
- Large daytime HR spike around 10–11am (HR deviation z = 2.71), indicating recurring physiological arousal that can reflect stress.  
- Behavioral signs often linked to distress (frequent naps z = 2.23; high sedentary hobby time z = 3.19).  
- Taken together these risk signals push toward higher perceived stress despite some protective features.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very short objective nightly sleep (median ~3 h 27 min, z = -0.66) and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10), both strongly tied to greater perceived stress in many studies.  
- High intradaily variability (z = 2.29), indicating marked rest–activity fragmentation that correlates with higher PSS.  
- Elevated sleep‑duration variability (SD z = 0.62) and increased nap rate (z = 1.24), which can accompany sleep loss and higher stress.  
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.94) that could add psychosocial stress (although its sample correlation with PSS is small).

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing of evidence
- Important caveat: each description is relative to its own study population mean PSS. Participant 1 is described as having an inferred PSS near their population mean (mean = 21.62). Participant 2 is described as having an inferred PSS below their population mean (mean = 21.42). So, within their respective cohorts, P1 ≈ average stress and P2 < average stress.  
- Strength of predictors: for Participant 2, the strongest sample‑level predictors (very low GAD‑7, strong self‑efficacy/NGSE, and very low emotional lability) all point toward substantially lower PSS; these measures have large correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., GAD‑7 r = 0.76; NGSE r = -0.65). These strong protective indicators likely outweigh the sleep‑related risk signals in probabilistic inference.  
- For Participant 1, although there are notable protective features (low trait anxiety, high happiness/self‑esteem, low resting HR), several risk features are present (subjective sleep disturbance, circadian fragmentation, large mid‑morning HR spike, depressive symptoms, frequent naps). The profile was judged “near the study population mean” rather than below it.  
- Comparing the two: Participant 1’s net profile centers around the cohort mean (i.e., not clearly low), whereas Participant 2’s profile is inferred to be below their cohort mean driven largely by powerful protective psychological predictors. Even though Participant 2 has severe sleep restriction (a serious risk), the sample‑level weight of their strong low‑anxiety/high‑self‑efficacy indicators makes lower PSS more probable for them than for Participant 1.

- Strong self-report signals linked to higher PSS: very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ +0.67) and high pain / functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93). Both measures correlate moderately with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62), and NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.69), so this predicts higher perceived stress.
- Physiologic circadian / cardiac signals associated with higher PSS: elevated mesor and resting HR (Mesor Z ≈ +0.7; RHR Z ≈ +0.61) and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–3 AM deviations Zs up to ≈ +1.38) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.83), indicating irregular day‑to‑day timing; in this dataset this has a small association with higher PSS.
- Integration statement in the description explicitly concludes participant’s PSS is likely above the population mean (with caveats that it’s moderate rather than extreme).

Mitigating features for Participant 1 (reduce likelihood of extreme PSS)
- Lower-than-average GAD-7 (mild anxiety; Z ≈ −0.76), a strong correlate of PSS, which pushes expectation downward.
- Long median nightly sleep duration (8h4m; Z ≈ +0.92) and low intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ −1.28) — somewhat protective.
- Emotional lability slightly below average (Z ≈ −0.37).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.61)
- Objective and subjective sleep problems: PSQI indicates “disturbed” sleep (PSQI = 6), substantial variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start time SD Z ≈ +1.55; duration SD Z ≈ +0.77). These sleep irregularities correlate positively (though weakly) with PSS in that sample (r ≈ +0.14–0.17).
- Reduced circadian regularity: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.99), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.37), and modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.46) — these are associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Frequent alcohol use (3+ times/week; Z ≈ +1.7) may be a behavioral risk/coping correlate, albeit with small correlation to PSS in this dataset.

Protective features for Participant 2 (reduce likelihood of higher PSS)
- Strong self-report protection: very low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 5; Z ≈ −0.86), modest trait anxiety (STAI‑T Z ≈ −0.23), high self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ +0.68), high momentary happiness (Z ≈ +1.64), and high health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.3). These measures are robustly associated with lower PSS in the sample.
- Behavioral protections: regular exercise (z > +1) and active socializing (2–3 hrs/day; Z ≈ +0.95).
- Physiological protection: low resting heart rate (48.3 bpm; Z ≈ −1.17; mesor Z ≈ −1.65) indicating low baseline cardiac arousal; this correlates with lower PSS in the sample.
- The integrated interpretation in the description explicitly concludes the participant’s PSS is most consistent with being below the sample mean (with caveats).

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both summaries are explicitly comparative to their respective sample means and both provide ribboned evidence rather than direct PSS values. Participant 1’s description contains several moderately strong, converging signals tied to higher PSS (large PSQI and PAPAS deviations, low NGSE with a strong correlation to PSS, and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations). These are described as some of the strongest stress-related signals in that sample.
- Participant 2’s description contains multiple strong protective signals (very low depressive symptoms, high happiness/self‑esteem, frequent exercise, low resting HR) that directly predict lower PSS in that sample, despite having some circadian/sleep irregularity and alcohol use that push weakly toward higher PSS.
- The net balance: Participant 1’s risk signals (subjective sleep disturbance magnitude, pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal cardiac arousal) are more numerous and more strongly linked to higher PSS in that sample than Participant 2’s risk signals are in Participant 2’s sample. Participant 2 has stronger and more numerous protective indicators (psychological well‑being measures and low resting HR) that outweigh the relatively weaker sleep/circadian risk signals.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
- Based on the within-sample comparative evidence provided, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Very elevated generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = 1.51) — the single strongest predictor here (r = 0.74) pointing to substantially higher perceived stress.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5; Z = 1.65) — meaningfully correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r = 0.63), increased pain/functional interference (PEG-3 elevated), and lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; r = -0.66) — multiple convergent self-report signals that correlate strongly with higher PSS.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely above the cohort mean — the subjective signals (which have larger effect sizes here) outweigh protective physiology.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.61)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T = 50; Z = 0.86) — a moderate predictor of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), shortened median sleep duration (6 h 34 min; Z = -0.77), and late habitual sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:45) — sleep-related features associated with higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness (Z = -0.53) — a modest correlate of higher PSS.
- The summary concludes the profile is mixed but leans toward near-to-slightly-above the cohort mean (i.e., modest elevation, likely within about 1 SD of mean).

Comparative weighing (within each study frame)
- Strength and consistency of predictors: Participant 1 shows multiple, large subjective elevations with strong correlations to PSS (especially GAD-7 and PSQI with large effect sizes), producing a clear above-mean signal. Participant 2 shows moderate elevations (STAI, shorter sleep, late timing) but each predictor has smaller effect sizes and several robust protective factors.
- Protective signals: Both have protective physiological markers (low resting HR, preserved circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability). These features are more pronounced and paired with stronger psychosocial assets in Participant 2 (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, high health satisfaction), which are likely to pull PSS closer to or below the mean for that cohort. In Participant 1 the protective physiology does not offset the strong subjective distress.
- Magnitude: Participant 1’s subjective scores (e.g., GAD-7 severe, PSQI extremely high) suggest a larger deviation from their cohort norms than Participant 2’s deviations from theirs.

Conclusion
- Overall balance of evidence favors Participant 1 as exhibiting the worse (higher) perceived stress.

21,30453,30,23,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 12, z = 0.46) — a strong correlate of PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77).
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5, z = 1.32) — substantially above the sample mean and correlated with higher PSS.
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal (overnight heart-rate deviations with z up to ~1.02) that positively correlate with PSS, suggesting fragmented autonomic recovery overnight.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) and emotional lability (BASIS-24) consistent with stress vulnerability.
- These signals were judged in the summary to outweigh mitigating signs (adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR, lower pain), leading to an above-mean PSS inference for this participant.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Extremely disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI z = 4.29) — an exceptionally large deviation and a robust correlate of perceived stress.
- High depressive symptoms (CES-D z = 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ 0.96) — both strong, convergent predictors of higher PSS.
- Objective physiological dysregulation: elevated resting HR/mesor (RHR z ≈ 1.11; MESOR z ≈ 0.85), reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ −0.63), low interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.9), and elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.6) — a profile consistent with stress-related autonomic and circadian disruption.
- Shorter and late/variable sleep timing (median sleep ≈ 6 h 25 m, sleep-start 01:21, sleep SD z ≈ 1.0) that compound subjective sleep problems.
- Although there are protective behaviors (regular exercise, no substance use), the summary concludes these do not outweigh the multiple, large risk signals; overall judged above the study mean.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective population means. The question is which is worse relative to their population baseline.
- Magnitude and breadth of deviations: Participant 2 exhibits several large z-scores (PSQI z = 4.29, CES-D z = 1.84, RHR z = 1.11, STAI z ≈ 0.96, low RSES z = −1.57) and multi-domain physiological/circadian dysregulation. Participant 1’s largest z-scores are more modest (PSQI z = 1.32, nocturnal HR deviations up to z ≈ 1.02, GAD z = 0.46); protective signals (lower resting HR, adequate objective sleep duration) are stronger for Participant 1.
- PSQI comparison is especially notable: Participant 2’s PSQI deviation (z = 4.29) is far larger than Participant 1’s (z = 1.32), indicating much more extreme subjective sleep disturbance relative to each sample—a powerful driver of PSS in both datasets.
- Participant 2 also shows a broader set of high-impact indicators (depression + anxiety + marked circadian/HR dysregulation + extreme subjective sleep disturbance), whereas Participant 1’s high-impact indicators are fewer and partly offset by healthier physiology (lower RHR, adequate sleep duration).

Overall judgment
- The preponderance and magnitude of risk signals are greater for Participant 2 when evaluated relative to their study population. Therefore Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse perceived stress).

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 46; Z ≈ 0.46). Trait anxiety correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), so this dispositional tendency pushes perceived stress upward relative to peers.  
- Lower self-esteem and lower current happiness (Rosenberg Z ≈ −0.73; happiness Z ≈ −0.53), both of which have modest negative correlations with PSS and therefore are small stress-promoting signals.  
- Recurrent daytime physiological arousal (very large morning HR deviation Z ≈ 3.52; substantial late-afternoon HR deviation Z ≈ 2.0) and modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.46) — these indicate stable, time-of-day elevations in arousal that can reflect repeated acute stressors and correlate positively (though modestly) with PSS.  
- Small positive relation of resting HR with PSS (resting HR Z ≈ 0.07; r ≈ 0.14) provides a minor additional physiological correlate of higher stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have a lower PSS score (protective, lowering likelihood of high PSS)
- Long, good-quality sleep (median ~9 h; PSQI ≈ 5; sleep Z-scores strongly positive) and pronounced nocturnal HR dips — strong physiological recovery signals associated with lower stress.  
- Robust circadian amplitude and 24-h autocorrelation (amplitude Z ≈ 1.0; autocorr Z ≈ 1.06), which correlate negatively with PSS (weakly).  
- Frequent exercise, high socializing, high health satisfaction, good academic functioning (Z-scores > 1), and low-to-moderate substance use — substantial behavioral/social buffers against perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Multiple strong self-report indicators tightly linked to PSS in this sample: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; PSQI r = 0.59), mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5; r = 0.80), and high emotional lability (BASIS-24 r = 0.67). These measures have large correlations with PSS and point coherently toward higher perceived stress.  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) that correlate moderately-to-strongly with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.47; PAPAS r ≈ 0.50), adding nontrivial burden likely to raise perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations during some late-night hours that are positively associated with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.45), suggesting sleep-related autonomic perturbations linked to stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS score (protective)
- Strong, regular circadian physiology (amplitude Z ≈ 0.95; 24-h autocorr Z ≈ 0.91) and consolidated daytime cardiovascular activation; these correlate negatively with PSS and act as buffers.  
- Long objectively measured sleep opportunity (median ~10 h; Z ≈ 1.64) and low napping — objective behaviors that often indicate consolidated rest and can mitigate stress effects.  
- Self-efficacy near the sample mean (NGSE Z ≈ −0.07) which correlates negatively with PSS and provides some resilience.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean (P1 mean 21.62; P2 mean 20.75). Participant 1 is characterized as near the population mean (likely within ±1 SD of 21.62, possibly modestly above) with many strong protective behavioral signals that substantially offset modest dispositional/physiological stress signals. The strongest stress-related features for P1 (trait anxiety and daytime HR spikes) have only modest correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16).  
- Participant 2 is explicitly described as likely above their population mean (20.75). Crucially, the primary predictors pushing P2 upward are self-report measures that show very strong correlations with PSS in that dataset (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.80; Emotional Lability r ≈ 0.67; PSQI r ≈ 0.59). Although P2 has notable wearable-derived protective signals, those have weaker associations with PSS than the self-report predictors that are elevated for this participant.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The stress-related signals for Participant 2 (especially anxiety, emotional lability, and subjective sleep disturbance) are both coherent and strongly predictive of higher PSS within that sample. Those strong survey-based predictors outweigh the protective wearable signals for P2 in the study’s predictive structure.  
- Participant 1 shows mixed signals with substantial behavioral and physiological protections (robust sleep, circadian regularity, exercise, social support) that likely keep perceived stress near the sample mean; the stress-promoting signals are either modest in effect size or have weaker correlations with PSS in that dataset.  
- Therefore, relative to their respective sample means and considering the predictor strengths, Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.32), which shows a small positive association with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Lifestyle factors that can worsen stress coping (very low physical activity, sedentary leisure, high video‑game use), even if they are not strongly correlated with PSS in this dataset.
- Note: these risk signals are modest in magnitude and counterbalanced by several protective factors (high happiness and self‑esteem, strong circadian regularity z ≈ 0.8, generally adequate and regular sleep, low trait anxiety).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; z = 0.67). PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.53), a relatively strong link.
- Extremely short median sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD z ≈ 0.89) and sleep onset (SD z ≈ 0.34) — objective sleep deprivation/irregularity are well‑established stress correlates.
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened amplitude (interdaily stability z ≈ -1.05; amplitude z ≈ -0.84), consistent with disrupted routines that commonly accompany higher perceived stress.
- Markedly elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS‑24 Interpersonal z ≈ 2.34), a salient contextual stressor for this participant even if that subscale has only a weak sample correlation with PSS.
- Evening heart‑rate elevations and blunted overall HR amplitude suggest altered physiological rhythms that often co‑occur with higher stress.
- Note: protective features exist (very low GAD‑7/anxiety, low pain, near‑average self‑efficacy, lower resting HR), but the sleep/circadian and interpersonal signals are relatively large.

Comparative within‑sample reasoning
- Magnitude and relevance of risk signals: Participant 2’s key risk markers (very short/irregular sleep, high PSQI with r ≈ 0.53, large negative interdaily stability z) are larger in magnitude and more strongly linked to PSS in this dataset than Participant 1’s risk signals (modest CES‑D elevation z ≈ 0.38 and small HR/variability effects).
- Protective factors: Participant 1 shows several substantial protective factors (high happiness, self‑esteem, and strong circadian regularity z ≈ 0.8) that the report interprets as pushing their likely PSS toward the population mean. Participant 2 has meaningful protections (low anxiety, low pain, average self‑efficacy), but these appear less able to offset the pronounced sleep and circadian disruption and the severe interpersonal strain.
- Direction of authors’ integrated judgments: The summaries concluded Participant 1 is likely near the population mean (with only modest upward risk), whereas Participant 2 was judged near the mean but with a modest tilt toward being above the mean. Given the stronger, higher‑magnitude sleep/circadian/interpersonal signals for Participant 2 and the stronger protective profile for Participant 1, the balance favors Participant 2 having the higher perceived stress relative to their respective cohorts.

- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61).
- Objective nocturnal physiological arousal (large positive hourly HR deviations overnight; some deviations with positive correlations to PSS), supporting a physiological pathway for elevated perceived stress.
- The combination of large symptom Z-scores and high correlations to PSS yields a coherent above-mean stress signal in this population.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 45, Z ≈ 0.37), which tends to co-occur with higher PSS.
- Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 6) and shorter-than-average sleep duration (median 6 h 14 min, Z ≈ -1.18), both of which can increase perceived stress.
- Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ -1.01), modestly associated with higher PSS in the study.
- However, these adverse signals are relatively small in magnitude (moderate/small Zs) and are counterbalanced by strong objective and behavioral protective factors (see below).

Comparative weighting within each participant’s cohort (relative-frame reasoning)
- Participant 1’s stress-related indicators are larger in magnitude and more directly linked to PSS in that sample: severe clinical anxiety (large Z and a very strong correlation), high pain/interference, disturbed sleep with corroborating nocturnal HR arousal, and very low self-efficacy. These signals point decisively above the Participant 1 study mean (20.62).
- Participant 2 presents a mixed profile: some subjective risks (moderate trait anxiety, disturbed/shorter sleep, lower self-esteem) but several strong protective/objective signals with large Zs that are negatively associated with PSS (very high interdaily stability Z ≈ 1.99, high amplitude Z ≈ 1.64, low resting HR Z ≈ -1.04, low intradaily variability Z ≈ -1.45, stable sleep timing, frequent exercise, low substance use). The adverse signals for Participant 2 are smaller and largely self-reported; overall the profile is near the Participant 2 study mean (21.61), likely slightly below when physiology/behavior are weighted.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have a higher perceived stress level relative to their cohort than Participant 2 is relative to theirs. Participant 1’s large, multimodal, and highly PSS-correlated symptom load (severe anxiety, severe sleep disturbance, pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR arousal) outweighs the circadian regularity protections noted for that participant. Participant 2’s stress-relevant signals are smaller and are substantially mitigated by strong objective circadian/fitness and behavioral advantages.

- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r = 0.49) and large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD z ≈ +1.12) — both are correlated with higher PSS and amplify self-reported stress vulnerability.
- Some physiological indicators consistent with higher arousal (resting HR z ≈ +1.31; MESOR z ≈ +1.19), which are congruent with a higher stress profile in this dataset.
- Although some wearable circadian metrics and aggregated HR correlations are weak or mixed, the strongest, most highly correlated predictors in this sample are the self-report variables that are elevated for this participant — cumulatively pointing to above-mean PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Marked sleep/circadian disruption: poor subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ +1.05), short median sleep duration (6 h 9 min, z ≈ -1.29), extreme late and variable sleep timing (median start ~03:36, start-time SD z ≈ +1.04), very high nap frequency (naps/day z ≈ +3.05). These sleep/timing features are associated with higher PSS in this sample (though many correlations are modest).
- Circadian fragmentation and instability: low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.98) and elevated intradaily variability (IV z ≈ +0.95); both metrics have modest associations with PSS in the dataset and together indicate disrupted 24-h structure that supports an above-mean stress inference.
- Some elevation in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI z ≈ +0.17; CES-D z ≈ +0.18), which correlate positively with PSS (STAI r ≈ +0.31, CES-D r ≈ +0.28), suggesting dispositional contributors to perceived stress.
- External stressor signal: recent GPA drop which could increase perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower-than-very-high PSS (protective within their frame)
- Lower physiological arousal markers (resting HR z ≈ -0.47; MESOR z ≈ -1.13) that modestly correlate with lower PSS in the sample.
- Low substance use and some modest positive health/self-care behaviors that attenuate the stress signal.

Comparative reasoning (within-population frames)
- Both participants are interpreted as above their respective study means. The key difference is effect-size and type of predictors:
  - Participant 1’s elevated measures (anxiety/emotional lability, low self-efficacy, very poor PSQI) map onto predictors that have large sample-level correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.67, NGSE r = -0.66). That makes the inference of higher perceived stress stronger and more directly supported.
  - Participant 2’s strongest signals are objective sleep/circadian dysregulation (very late/variable timing, high naps, low interdaily stability, blunted amplitude). These features are plausibly linked to higher PSS here but generally have smaller sample-level correlations with PSS (many r values ≈ 0.1–0.3). Participant 2 also shows physiological and behavioral protections (low resting HR, low substance use) that partially offset the sleep/circadian signal.
- In short, Participant 1 shows multiple high-correlation, elevated self-report risk factors for perceived stress, whereas Participant 2 shows notable circadian/sleep disruption but with smaller predictor effect sizes and clearer physiological protective signals.

Overall judgment
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (i.e., a PSS score further above their study mean) because their profile includes several measures that are both elevated and have strong sample-level correlations with PSS, producing a stronger, more convergent signal of elevated perceived stress than Participant 2’s mixed profile.

19,51851,28,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 20.75)
- Strong contributors linked to higher PSS in this sample:
  - Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10). Anxiety had the strongest correlation with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.78), so reaching a clinically relevant anxiety threshold is a large risk factor for elevated perceived stress.
  - Severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = 1.0, “disturbed sleep”), median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 38 min (Z = -0.94), very late and highly variable sleep-start times (median 03:12 AM; SD sleep onset Z = 1.3). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.47).
  - Nocturnal physiological arousal: large overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., +13.5 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = 1.17; +9.8 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = 1.59), and overnight HR deviations correlate modestly with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
  - Some pain-related functional interference (PAPAS = 65) which correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.48).
- Countervailing (protective) signals present but smaller relative weight:
  - Above-average self-efficacy (Z = 0.3; self-efficacy r with PSS ≈ -0.68).
  - Low emotional lability (Z = -0.97; emotional lability r with PSS ≈ +0.72).
- Overall: multiple strong, positively correlated drivers of higher PSS (anxiety, extreme sleep disruption, nocturnal arousal) outweigh protective traits, and the description explicitly concludes perceived stress is likely above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.62)
- Factors that would push PSS upward:
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; Z ≈ 0.59), and objective circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.74; high intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.23).
  - Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (notable positive Z-scores around 8–11 pm), and variable sleep timing (sleep-start SD Z ≈ 0.61). These features are associated in the dataset with modest increases in PSS.
- Strong opposing (protective) factors that reduce likelihood of high PSS:
  - Low trait anxiety (STAI–Trait Z ≈ -0.62) and non-elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D ~14).
  - High self-esteem and health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.1 and +1.63), frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07 to +1.58), and very low resting HR (41.1 bpm, Z ≈ -2.03), all linked to lower perceived stress.
  - Social/behavioral patterns and low substance/recreational risk are also protective.
- Overall: sleep/circadian signals suggest some stress risk, but several strong protective trait and behavioral markers balance these; the description concludes perceived stress is most consistent with being near the cohort mean.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Both reports are written relative to their own cohort means. Participant 1 is characterized as “likely above” their cohort mean (20.75) with multiple high-weight contributors (especially GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.78 and extreme objective sleep loss). Participant 2 is characterized as “near” their cohort mean (21.62), with sleep/circadian concerns but strong protective traits (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, frequent exercise, very low RHR).
- The magnitude and strength of P1’s risk signals exceed P2’s: P1 has extreme short sleep (2.6 hours median), significant nocturnal physiological arousal, and clinically meaningful anxiety—all factors that, in this dataset, have strong links to higher PSS. P2’s elevated signals are milder (PSQI = 8, circadian irregularity, evening HR) and are counterbalanced by multiple robust protective factors.
- Therefore, even accounting for each participant only relative to their own study mean, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

22,95543,10,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ +1.0 to +1.22) and modest positive association with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14), which could reflect greater physiological arousal.
- Pronounced evening heart-rate deviations (8–9 pm, Z ≈ 2.09), suggesting late-day activation or stress-related arousal.
- Very late median sleep start time (~02:25 AM), which can be associated with circadian misalignment or schedule-related stress even though duration/quality are good.
- These physiological/timing signals are relatively small-moderate correlates of PSS in the dataset, so they leave open a limited possibility of higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16, Z = +0.83) and a strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.58), a substantive predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.80) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), likely pushing perceived stress upward.
- Wearable sleep metrics indicating extreme shortness/irregularity (median sleep 1h44m, high start-time SD) and nocturnal HR deviations around midnight–early morning (some positive Zs) consistent with nocturnal arousal and aligning with the elevated PSQI.
- Although there are protective factors (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, regular circadian markers, low resting HR), the sleep and pain signals are strong, and the summary explicitly infers PSS near-to-modestly-above the population mean.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each participant’s description is given relative to their own cohort mean (P1 mean = 21.62; P2 mean = 21.5). Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes their profile is most consistent with a PSS below their sample mean, supported by multiple robust protective signals (very low depression/anxiety Zs, good sleep quality PSQI Z ≈ -1.72, high happiness/self-esteem, social exercise, strong circadian regularity). The physiological risk signals for P1 are present but small in magnitude and have modest correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2’s profile is characterized as mixed but “near the sample mean” with evidence that stress may be modestly above the mean driven primarily by strong predictors (subjective sleep disturbance and pain/interference). Importantly, PSQI and pain measures in P2 have stronger correlations with PSS in that sample than the small HR/timing correlates observed in P1.
- Put another way: P1 shows a preponderance of signals associated with lower-than-average PSS in their cohort, with only minor physiological counter-signals. P2 shows some of the strongest single-domain predictors of higher PSS (sleep and pain), even though protective factors temper the overall severity.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress. Participant 1’s multiple, consistent protective markers (psychological, behavioral, circadian) and explicit conclusion of below-mean PSS argue against P1 having higher stress. Participant 2’s elevated PSQI and pain/interference — both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS — provide a stronger case for elevated perceived stress relative to their cohort mean.

3,35361,13,21,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) in this sample, so this is a meaningful risk factor.
- Pain and interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS indicate non-trivial pain/interference; these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54 (elevated), which may reduce perceived support and contribute to stress in context.
- Elevated basal physiology: Mesor and resting HR are above sample mean (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), which could reflect higher autonomic arousal associated with stress for some individuals.
- Although anxiety is only mild (GAD-7 = 5.5), PSS correlates strongly with anxiety in the dataset (r ≈ 0.77), so any anxiety contributes risk.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Large nocturnal heart‑rate troughs: pronounced nighttime deviations (Zs down to ≈ −1.7) — in this dataset early‑morning troughs show small positive correlations with PSS (~0.14–0.21), so this is a small cautionary signal.
- Reduced social/trust indicators: low trust (Z ≈ −1.1) and less time socializing (Z ≈ −0.62) could, in some cases, elevate perceived stress, though correlations with PSS here are small.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Each profile is assessed relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1’s integrated interpretation explicitly places them near the sample mean PSS (mean = 21.38), with a modest tendency toward slightly below the mean due to strong protective factors (high NGSE, robust circadian regularity, low substance use). But P1 still presents several nontrivial risk factors (poor subjective sleep, pain/interference, interpersonal strain, modestly elevated resting HR).
- Participant 2’s profile is consistently described as below their study mean PSS (mean = 21.62). Multiple convergent indicators (low depressive and trait anxiety scores, high self‑esteem, good subjective sleep, regular circadian structure, low resting HR) point to lower perceived stress. The few potential concerns (nighttime HR troughs, lower trust/socializing) are small effects that do not counterbalance the dominant low‑stress signal.
- Weighing the balance: Participant 2 shows a coherent, multi-domain signal of lower-than-average perceived stress in their sample. Participant 1 shows mixed signals—some clear risk factors but also strong protective resources—and is estimated near or slightly below their sample mean. Because Participant 1’s profile contains more and larger risk signals relative to their population (notably very poor PSQI and pain/interference) while Participant 2’s profile is overall protective, Participant 1 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the higher perceived stress score in their respective samples.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and objectively large night‑to‑night sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 136 min).
- Circadian instability: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.82), slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.10), and low autocorr24 (Z ≈ -0.53).
- Late and somewhat inconsistent sleep timing (median start ~00:50, sleep start SD ≈ 67 min).

Note: Several protective signals (high health satisfaction, momentary happiness, very high self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR and good HR amplitude, low substance use, good GPA) moderate these risks; the description concludes P1 is near the population mean with only a modest tilt toward elevated stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean 21.33)
- Severe and objectively corroborated sleep disruption: very high PSQI (13.5), extremely short median sleep (~3 h/night), and very large night‑to‑night sleep‑start variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). PSQI and sleep measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9.0 (strong positive correlation with PSS, r = 0.78) and BASIS‑24 emotional lability elevated (r = 0.68).
- Substance‑related problems (BASIS‑24 substance abuse Z ≈ 1.75) and some pain‑related interference (measures that correlate positively with PSS).
- Marked circadian/rhythm disruption: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.42), low amplitude (Z ≈ -1.10), and low autocorr24 (Z ≈ -0.68), which in this dataset associate with higher PSS.
- Multiple strong correlates with PSS (GAD‑7, PSQI, emotional lability) point in the same direction.
Protective factors (very high self‑efficacy NGSE = 40, low resting HR/mesor) are present but were judged insufficient to offset the strong stress‑linked signals.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean; P1 is characterized as near the mean (21.61) with modest, mixed indicators and several strong protective factors that temper risk.
- P2 is explicitly characterized as above the mean (21.33), with multiple, large, and strongly PSS‑correlated indicators (especially extreme objective and subjective sleep disruption, strong anxiety symptom correlation, emotional lability, and substance issues).
- The magnitude and number of PSS‑linked signals are greater and more concordant for Participant 2 (larger Z‑scores, extreme objective sleep shortness/variability, and stronger variable–PSS correlations such as GAD‑7 r = 0.78) than for Participant 1 (weaker correlations, mixed protective signals, and less extreme objective disturbance).

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 2 shows a stronger, more consistent set of high‑stress indicators (sleep, anxiety, substance/pain, circadian instability) that in this sample have larger effect sizes and Z‑scores.
- Participant 1 shows some stress‑related signals but also multiple robust protective factors; overall P1 is assessed as near the sample mean with only a modest lean toward higher stress.

- Strong sleep pathology with high PSS-relevance:
  - Clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5) and extremely short objective sleep (median ~3 h 30 min; very late sleep onset ~03:37). In this sample, PSQI and objective short sleep had moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48 and similar).
- Elevated pain/interference:
  - PEG-3 Z = +1.33 and PAPAS Z = +0.43; pain measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.5), supporting higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and circadian attenuation:
  - Nighttime heart-rate elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67 around late night/early morning), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −0.34) and lower 24-h autocorrelation — all of which in this sample relate to higher PSS (nocturnal HR correlations up to r ≈ 0.43).
- Convergence of multiple moderate-to-strong PSS-linked signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) increases likelihood of above-mean PSS despite protective factors.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated basal cardiovascular tone:
  - High resting HR (75.7 bpm, Z ≈ +2.09) and MESOR (Z ≈ +2.03). These are pronounced physiological deviations that imply greater autonomic arousal.
- Circadian instability and sleep timing irregularity:
  - Low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.32), low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.54), blunted amplitude (Z ≈ −0.97), and high night-to-night sleep-start variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ +1.89). These objective circadian/sleep irregularities are associated with higher perceived stress in group data.
- Subjective sleep disturbance:
  - PSQI = 7 (disturbed-sleep range) and late median sleep onset (~02:18), which are linked to higher PSS.

Comparative, within-frame considerations (each relative to its own study mean)
- Strength and relevance of associations:
  - Participant 1’s elevated features (subjective sleep disturbance, extreme objective sleep restriction, and pain) are metrics that, in this sample, show moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.5). That gives greater predictive weight to those abnormalities for higher PSS.
  - Participant 2’s largest deviations are physiological (RHR/MESOR Z ≈ +2), but resting HR shows only a weak positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.14). Circadian instability and sleep variability are relevant but their sample correlations appear weaker than Participant 1’s top indicators.
- Extent/severity of abnormalities:
  - Participant 1 has extreme objective sleep restriction (very short sleep time) and substantial pain interference — clinically salient abnormalities that strongly point above that sample’s mean.
  - Participant 2 has pronounced physiological deviations but simultaneously very low self-reported depression/anxiety and strong psychosocial resources (which in this sample are robustly linked to lower PSS), producing a more mixed/near-mean profile.
- Net integration in each summary:
  - The provided synthesis for Participant 1 concludes “above the population mean” with moderate confidence driven by convergent sleep/pain/nocturnal-arousal signals.
  - The synthesis for Participant 2 concludes “near the study population mean” with modest tendency to be elevated, largely because strong objective signals are offset by low self-reported mood/anxiety and good psychosocial buffers.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Participant 1 shows multiple, moderately-to-strongly PSS-linked abnormalities (very short/late sleep, high PSQI, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations) whose sample-level correlations with PSS are larger than the correlations tying Participant 2’s biggest abnormalities (primarily elevated RHR/MESOR) to PSS.
- Participant 2’s physiological deviations are large in Z-score terms but are less predictive of PSS in this dataset and are counterbalanced by clear protective self-report factors (very low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, good functioning).
- Therefore, weighing predictive relevance, severity, and the stated within-sample inferences, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically significant) and median nightly sleep ≈ 4 h 21 min — both linked to higher PSS in the sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.48).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (z > 1; 1–2 AM deviation r ≈ 0.46 with PSS), consistent with stress-linked nocturnal arousal.  
- Irregular sleep timing: high variability in sleep start (SD ≈ 123 min), which can contribute to perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated daytime physiological arousal: higher resting heart rate (RHR Z = 0.86) and mesor (Z = 0.61), plus larger daytime HR deviations — objective signs that correlate (albeit weakly) with higher PSS (RHR r ≈ 0.13).  
- Intraday fragmentation and variability: intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.53 (r ≈ 0.16 with PSS), suggesting greater within-day instability linked to stress.  
- Sleep timing and shorter sleep: late median sleep start (01:32) and somewhat short median duration (~6 h 48 min, Z ≈ -0.47), patterns often associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Affective strain: momentary happiness below average (Z ≈ -0.53) and STAI flagged as “anxious” (score = 42), indicating some psychosocial strain.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.21) primarily because very low trait anxiety (GAD-7 = 2.0) and higher self-efficacy are strongly predictive of lower PSS (large correlations: GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). Those strong protective signals were judged to outweigh the moderate sleep-related risk signals.  
- Participant 2 is inferred to be near the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61), with modest tilt toward below-mean when psychosocial buffers are weighted; however, multiple modest objective and affective indicators (elevated RHR/mesor, intradaily variability, late sleep timing, lower momentary happiness) point to somewhat greater perceived stress than a clearly low-stress profile would. The physiological and behavioral signals for Participant 2 are more consistently indicative of modest arousal than Participant 1’s daytime profile.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed profile but stronger, highly predictive trait signals (very low anxiety, higher self-efficacy) point to substantially below-mean PSS despite marked sleep problems and nocturnal arousal.  
- Participant 2: overall profile centers on the sample mean with several modest, consistent indicators of physiological/affective strain; fewer very strong protective signals than P1’s trait measures.  
- Therefore, although neither participant is characterized as markedly above their respective population means, Participant 2’s aggregate profile is more consistent with higher perceived stress relative to their own population than Participant 1 is relative to theirs.

- Low behavioral activation: reports no regular exercise (large negative Z for exercise frequency), a factor that tends to co‑occur with higher perceived stress.

- No alcohol or recreational drug use (protective).

- Some social/leisure engagement (above‑average socializing and music listening) and above‑average interdaily stability/autocorrelation, indicating some preserved daily structure.  
- Physiological elevations are modest (RHR/mesor Z ≈ +0.3), not large.

- Very strong self‑report predictors of PSS: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5, Z = +1.25; GAD‑7–PSS r = 0.81) and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16, Z = +0.83; PSQI–PSS r = 0.51). These measures are highly weighted predictors of PSS in this study.  
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.62), which is a strong inverse correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.66).  
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS) that correlates moderately with PSS (r ~ 0.44–0.48), adding psychosocial strain.  
- Marked physiological arousal: resting HR 79.8 bpm (Z ≈ +1.53) and mesor 88.5 (Z ≈ +1.49), indicating elevated baseline cardiovascular activation strongly consistent with stress.  
- Wearable sleep summary shows very short median sleep (2 h 31 min, Z ≈ −0.97), late/irregular sleep start (SD 254 min, Z ≈ +0.98), aligning with disrupted sleep and high stress (though note possible measurement artifact).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have extremely high PSS (mitigating factors)
- Some circadian stability indicators are present (interdaily stability Z ≈ +0.65, 24‑h autocorrelation Z ≈ +0.64) and intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ −0.75), suggesting preserved day‑to‑day structure and low within‑day fragmentation (protective).  
- Aggregated hourly HR shows a preserved diurnal pattern (amplitude Z ≈ +0.43) despite elevated mesor/RHR.  
- Wearable sleep duration may be undercounted (measurement caveat), though subjective PSQI corroborates poor sleep.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength/weight of predictors: Participant 2’s strongest self‑report predictor (GAD‑7) has an extremely high correlation with PSS in that study (r = 0.81), making severe anxiety a very powerful indicator of above‑mean PSS for that population. Participant 1’s strongest self‑report predictors (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29, STAI r ≈ 0.32) are substantially weaker correlates of PSS in their sample. Thus, given equally sized z‑score deviations, the same construct would predict a larger PSS elevation for Participant 2 than for Participant 1.  
- Magnitude of physiological signal: Participant 2 shows large physiological elevations (RHR/mesor Z ≈ +1.5) consistent with sustained arousal; Participant 1’s physiological elevations are modest (RHR Z ≈ +0.3). A larger physiological Z in Participant 2 supports a stronger deviation from their sample mean in stress‑related physiology.  
- Sleep signals: Participant 1 has a notably short but plausible median sleep (6 h, Z ≈ −1.45) and very high PSQI (Z ≈ +1.52). Participant 2 has an extreme wearable sleep short duration (2.5 h, Z ≈ −0.97) that may be at least partly an artifact, but subjective PSQI is also very poor (Z ≈ +0.83). The combination of severe anxiety + poor subjective sleep in Participant 2 is a heavier weighted combination (given study correlations) than Participant 1’s combination of depression/anxiety + sleep disturbance.  
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s profile points to a meaningful but moderate elevation in perceived stress relative to their study mean. Participant 2’s profile contains several high‑weight indicators (severe GAD, low self‑efficacy with strong inverse correlation to PSS, elevated RHR/mesor) that together imply a larger deviation above their study mean.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 2 presents multiple converging, high‑weight indicators that are strongly associated with PSS in their study (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.81, NGSE r = −0.66, elevated RHR/mesor Z ≈ +1.5).  
- Participant 1 shows moderate elevations on several domains (depression, trait anxiety, poor sleep) but with weaker study‑level correlations to PSS and smaller physiological z‑scores overall.  
- Even accounting for measurement caveats (possible undercounting of P2 wearable sleep), the severity and correlational weight of Participant 2’s anxiety, low self‑efficacy, pain interference, and physiological arousal indicate a higher likely PSS relative to their population mean than Participant 1’s likely deviation relative to theirs.

- Clinically elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5; correlates moderately with PSS, r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep duration (median ~4 h 21 min) and large variability in sleep timing — severe sleep restriction/irregularity can increase perceived stress.
- Marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (large positive deviations, z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation showing a moderate correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46). These suggest nocturnal arousal that can raise perceived stress or sleep-related distress.
- Together these sleep/nocturnal physiology signals are the main stress-elevating evidence in this profile.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- High depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 31; z ≈ 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI‑T = 49; z ≈ 0.76). Both are self-report indicators positively associated with PSS (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11; z ≈ 1.98) and somewhat short sleep duration (median ~6 h 38 min; z ≈ −0.68).
- Objective circadian/physiological markers of fragmentation: elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.60), somewhat reduced amplitude and autocorrelation, and a pronounced morning heart-rate surge (8–9 AM deviation +16.03; z ≈ 2.09). These physiological signatures align with greater stress burden in the sample.
- Additional supportive signals: high self‑reported internet use and lower happiness, which in this dataset align with higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame (taking into account correlations and z-scores)
- Participant 1’s strongest signals for low PSS are trait anxiety (GAD‑7 very low; r ≈ 0.77 with PSS) and relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE; r ≈ −0.65). These measures have large correlations with PSS in that sample and sizable z deviations in the protective direction, making them powerful predictors of below‑mean PSS in that study.
- Participant 1’s countervailing evidence (poor PSQI, very short sleep, nocturnal HR arousal) is notable and potentially clinically important, but the description emphasizes these signals have only moderate correlations with PSS in the sample. The integrated inference in the file is that Participant 1 is probably below the sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.21).
- Participant 2 shows several convergent elevations in self‑reported mood (CES‑D high, STAI modestly high) and sleep complaints (PSQI high) plus objective circadian fragmentation and a very large morning HR deviation (z ≈ 2.09). Multiple domains point toward above‑mean PSS. Although some individual correlations (e.g., CES‑D r ~0.28) are smaller than GAD‑7’s correlation in Participant 1’s file, the number and magnitude of elevated signals in Participant 2 (several z’s ≈ 1.8–2.1) produce a coherent picture of above‑mean perceived stress in that study (population mean = 21.61).
- Direct comparison: Participant 1’s strongest predictors (very low anxiety and higher self‑efficacy) are tightly and strongly linked to lower PSS in that dataset and outweigh their sleep-based risk signals in the study’s integrated judgment. Participant 2, by contrast, has multiple large, convergent risk signals across mood, sleep, and physiology that the study authors infer produce a PSS above that population mean. Given both profiles are described relative to similar population means (~21.2 vs ~21.6), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

15,63904,15,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population)
- High subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ +0.67). PSQI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).  
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93), which also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.62), and NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.69).  
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z ≈ +0.6–0.7) and pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations (midnight–early-morning Zs up to ≈ +1.38), physiologic signals that in this cohort are associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47 for night HR).  
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83), a circadian irregularity modestly associated with higher PSS.

Mitigating factors noted within this cohort:
- Low-to-mild current anxiety (GAD-7 = 5; Z ≈ -0.76), which is strongly related to PSS in the sample and would reduce expected PSS.  
- Relatively long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 4 min; Z ≈ +0.92) and low mean daily naps.  
- Low intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ -1.28) and slightly below-average emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.37).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 30; Z ≈ +1.74), a strong indicator associated with higher PSS (sample r ≈ 0.28).  
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z ≈ +1.16), which also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Markedly short median nightly sleep (5 h 49 min; Z ≈ -1.69) and disturbed sleep per PSQI (score = 6), both commonly accompanying higher perceived stress.  
- Low subjective happiness (Z ≈ -1.61) and reduced self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ -1.15), which align with greater stress vulnerability.  
- Behavioral risk: virtually no exercise (Zs ≈ -1.6 to -1.9), linked to poorer stress management; modest physiological signs of blunted amplitude and slightly elevated resting HR.

Mitigating factors noted within this cohort:
- High interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate (Z ≈ +1.0 and +1.06), indicative of preserved circadian regularity and negatively associated with PSS in this sample.  
- Above-average social activity (Z ≈ +0.95) and absence of alcohol/drug use—behavioral buffers against high stress.  
- Overall circadian timing and day–night separation relatively preserved.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both participant profiles are interpreted by their study teams as above the respective population mean PSS.  
- Participant 1’s strongest stress-related signals are sleep quality (subjective), pain, lower self-efficacy, and nocturnal HR elevations. However, several protective features (low anxiety, long objectively measured sleep duration, low intradaily variability) moderate the expected PSS elevation; many of Participant 1’s Z-scores for risk indicators are moderate (around |0.6–0.9|), with only some nocturnal HR spikes reaching Z ≈ 1.3–1.4.  
- Participant 2’s risk indicators include multiple, larger-magnitude psychological symptom elevations (CES-D Z ≈ +1.74, STAI Z ≈ +1.16) and very short sleep (Z ≈ -1.69). These are multiple, sizable deviations in domains strongly linked to PSS and therefore provide a stronger, convergent signal of higher perceived stress within that cohort. Protective circadian regularity and social engagement for Participant 2 attenuate but do not fully offset these large symptom elevations.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows larger-magnitude, multi-domain deviations (notably depression, trait anxiety, and short sleep) that are robust contributors to perceived stress within their study sample.  
- Participant 1 shows several stress-related signals but many are moderate in size and are counterbalanced by several protective features (especially low/anodyne GAD-7 and long objective sleep duration).  
- Therefore, within the comparative, within-cohort framings provided, Participant 2’s profile indicates a higher overall perceived stress relative to their population than Participant 1’s profile does relative to theirs.

7,82728,15,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), subjective sleep-quality Z > 0 and wearable sleep-duration Z < 0 — a mismatch that often accompanies higher perceived stress.  
- Late and variable sleep timing: median sleep start ≈ 01:05 AM with high night-to-night variability (start-time SD ≈ 93 min), which is commonly associated with elevated perceived stress.  
- Reduced positive affect and health satisfaction: happiness Z ≈ -0.53 and health-satisfaction Z ≈ -0.45, which can co-occur with higher perceived stress.  
- Small early-morning HR associations with PSS: hourly HR deviations around 3–6 AM with small positive correlations (~0.19–0.21) could reflect subtle arousal patterns linked to stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Very severe sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15.5 (z = 0.67) and extremely short median wearable sleep (4 h 22 min), both strong, direct correlates of elevated PSS in this dataset (PSQI–PSS r ≈ 0.53).  
- High night-to-night variability: very large SDs in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = 0.89) and sleep onset time (SD = 204 min; z = 0.34), indicating irregular sleep patterns that typically accompany greater perceived stress.  
- Marked circadian disruption: low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.05), blunted amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -0.84), low autocorrelation — objective rhythm features that in this sample are associated with higher stress.  
- Notable interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = 2.34 (substantially elevated), a contextual factor likely to increase ongoing perceived stress for this participant.

Protective indicators that temper high-PSS inference for each participant (brief)
- Participant 1: strong protective signals — robust circadian metrics (IS z ≈ 0.75, amplitude z ≈ 1.54), frequent exercise (z ≈ 1.07), low substance use, low anxiety/depression (STAI and CES-D slightly below mean), high self-esteem — these lean toward lower perceived stress.  
- Participant 2: protective signs include minimal reported anxiety (GAD-7 z ≈ -1.38), low pain and emotional lability (large negative z’s), near-average self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.07), and lower resting HR — these pull against a very high PSS.

Comparative reasoning (within-sample framing)
- Directional conclusions provided in the summaries: Participant 1 is judged “near to slightly below” their sample mean PSS (mean = 21.61). Participant 2 is judged “near the sample mean, with a modest tilt toward being above” their sample mean PSS (mean = 21.29).  
- Severity and number of stress-consistent indicators are greater for Participant 2: extremely short sleep duration, much larger sleep variability, substantially elevated PSQI, objective circadian dampening, and high interpersonal-strain score. Those are strong, multi-domain signals that more consistently point toward higher perceived stress in Participant 2’s study context.  
- Participant 1’s stress-relevant signals are milder and partly offset by multiple robust protective signals (objective circadian robustness, frequent exercise, low anxiety/depression). The sleep problems and reduced positive affect in Participant 1 are notable but comparatively limited in magnitude and scope versus Participant 2’s multi-faceted dysregulation.

Overall judgment
- Balancing the evidence and interpreting each profile relative to its own population mean, Participant 2 more plausibly exhibits the higher perceived stress level.

3,43382,13,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean)
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES‑D = 28 (Z ≈ 1.53), a notable positive indicator for higher PSS.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI–Trait = 46 (Z ≈ 0.46), also positively associated with PSS.
- Lower self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ -0.87), which is associated with higher stress.
- Short and late sleep (median ~6h10m, Z ≈ -1.27 and late sleep onset), which can impair recovery and increase perceived stress.
- Moderately elevated resting HR / MESOR (Zs ≈ 0.6–1.3), suggesting higher tonic autonomic tone consistent with more stress.
- While there are protective signs (high happiness and health satisfaction, strong circadian regularity, low substance use), the summary explicitly concludes a moderate elevation above the sample mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean)
- Poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 10.5, which correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS) above median and positively correlated with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54), a possible contributor to perceived stress.
- Elevated resting HR / MESOR (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), a weak physiological correlate of stress.
- Note: anxiety level is mild (GAD‑7 = 5.5), and several strong protective factors counterbalance the risks (see below).

Comparative considerations within each study frame
- Strength and direction of predictors: Participant 1’s strongest risks are elevated depressive symptoms (large positive Z) and short/late sleep; these are direct psychological and sleep signals that the Participant‑1 summary identifies as the primary drivers of higher PSS. Participant 2’s strongest single effect is high general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.41), and in this dataset NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63), a powerful protective factor.
- Circadian/behavioral regularity: Participant 2 shows much larger positive Zs for circadian stability and amplitude (interdaily stability Z = 2.13, autocorr Z = 1.57, amplitude Z = 1.73) than Participant 1 (interdaily stability Z = 0.33, autocorr Z = 0.73). These strong regularity signals in Participant 2 are protective and weigh heavily against the participant being above their population mean.
- Magnitude of net evidence from each profile: Participant 1’s net assessment in the provided summary explicitly favors an above‑mean PSS (moderate elevation). Participant 2’s integrated assessment explicitly favors near or slightly below the population mean because strong protective factors (NGSE, circadian regularity, low emotional lability) outweigh the sleep/pain/interpersonal risks.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple psychological and sleep indicators point toward higher perceived stress relative to their sample mean; protective factors are present but less dominant.
- Participant 2: notable risk factors exist (subjective sleep problems, pain, interpersonal strain), but the strongest and most predictive signals in this dataset (high NGSE, pronounced circadian regularity, low emotional lability) point toward stress at or slightly below that study’s mean.

- Objective physiological signals associated with higher PSS:
  - Elevated resting heart rate (75.5 bpm; Z = +2.06) — a strong deviation though its correlation with PSS in this sample is modest (r ≈ 0.15).
  - Reduced circadian robustness: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.81), low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.16), and low cosinor amplitude (Z ≈ −1.85). These metrics are associated with higher PSS in the sample (correlations around r ≈ 0.15–0.16).
  - Hourly HR pattern showing evening/night elevations and pronounced nocturnal minima consistent with circadian perturbation/nocturnal arousal.
- The integrated write-up notes a plausible lean toward above-mean perceived stress driven by physiology despite self-report.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or not elevated) PSS
- Strong self-report protections that directly predict lower PSS:
  - Low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ −0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ −1.41).
  - Above-average self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ +0.68) and good self-reported health.
  - Good subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ −0.8) and objectively long sleep duration (Z ≈ +1.08).
  - Good social engagement and functioning.
- The summary emphasizes that subjective indicators (same domain as PSS) favor a below-mean PSS; physiological predictors have only modest correlations with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Prominent subjective and functional signals that correlate substantially with PSS:
  - Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83) with a strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.58).
  - Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.8), both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
  - Wearable indicators consistent with nocturnal arousal / disrupted sleep (very short median wearable sleep, high sleep start-time variability), aligning with the high PSQI.
- The summary explicitly judges a modest uplift above the mean driven by sleep disturbance and pain.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or not elevated) PSS
- Robust protective self-report traits strongly associated with lower PSS:
  - Very low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ −1.2), and in this sample GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS (r = 0.75).
  - High self-efficacy (NGSE) inverse-correlated with PSS (r = −0.68) and good interpersonal functioning (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ −0.87).
- Physiological markers indicate circadian robustness and lower cardiac arousal: low intradaily variability (Z ≈ −1.35), higher amplitude (Z ≈ +1.38), and low resting HR (54.1 bpm; Z ≈ −1.02). These are weakly inversely correlated with PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Domain relevance and correlation strengths:
  - Participant 1’s above-mean signals are mainly objective physiology with only modest correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.15–0.16). Their subjective/self-report domain (which most directly maps to PSS) indicates below-mean distress.
  - Participant 2’s strongest risk signals are subjective sleep disturbance and pain, which have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.52–0.58). Although Participant 2 also has strong protective traits (notably very low GAD-7, r with PSS = 0.75), the presence of multiple elevated, strongly PSS-linked subjective measures (sleep + pain) is a substantive upward force on inferred PSS.
- Magnitude and consistency:
  - Participant 1 shows a notable physiological deviation (e.g., RHR Z +2.06) but those physiological features are only weak predictors of perceived stress in that cohort and conflict with consistent low subjective distress.
  - Participant 2 shows multiple subjective/functional elevations that are direct and relatively strong predictors of perceived stress (PSQI, pain measures), and these are partially offset but not entirely negated by resilience indicators.
- Net judgment: Participant 2’s profile contains stronger, more directly PSS-relevant elevations (sleep disturbance and pain) with moderate-to-strong sample correlations to PSS; Participant 1’s main elevations are physiological signals with weaker links to PSS and are contradicted by low self‑reported distress. Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to be modestly above their population mean PSS than Participant 1 is above theirs.

- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = +1.03) and pain/functional interference (PEG-3 elevated), both positively associated with PSS.

- Multiple high-impact subjective indicators converge, and the summary explicitly concludes PSS above the study mean despite some protective physiology.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55; Z = +1.35), a strong positive correlate of PSS in this sample.
- Objective signs of autonomic/circadian dysregulation: elevated resting heart rate (70.8 bpm; Z = +1.50), markedly blunted circadian amplitude (Z = −1.76) and very low interdaily stability (IS Z = −1.73).
- Disturbed and highly variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:03; sleep start SD Z = +0.86; sleep duration SD Z = +1.25) and poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = +0.59).
- Several indicators (physiological arousal + circadian irregularity + sleep variability) converge on higher perceived stress, though some protective features (low depressive score, near-7h median sleep, low substance use) temper the inference.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both participant summaries conclude “above the population mean,” but magnitude and weight of predictors differ. Participant 1’s elevation is driven primarily by multiple very large subjective signals (especially GAD-7 and PSQI) that have strong correlations with PSS in that cohort. Those subjective measures are unusually extreme (high Zs) and are described as the dominant evidence for elevated PSS.
- Participant 2 shows a mix of moderate-to-strong signals with more pronounced objective dysregulation (high RHR, blunted amplitude, low IS) and elevated trait anxiety, but subjective sleep and mood measures are generally less extreme than Participant 1’s (PSQI and depressive symptoms are only mildly elevated or near-normal). The summary notes more mitigating/protective features for Participant 2 than for Participant 1.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 presents multiple, highly elevated self-report predictors of PSS (GAD-7 and PSQI notably extreme) and additional psychosocial burdens (pain, emotional lability, lower self-efficacy). Those measures are strongly correlated with PSS in their sample and are described as carrying the greatest weight.
- Participant 2 has important physiological and circadian indicators of stress and elevated trait anxiety, but subjective symptom severity is less extreme and there are more mitigating signs (lower depressive burden, near-normal median sleep duration, limited substance use).
- Given the relative extremity and predictive strength of Participant 1’s self-report measures, the overall evidence favors Participant 1 as having the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) in absolute terms across the two described profiles.

- Wearable-derived physiology indicating stress-related patterns:
  - Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.09) and reduced interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), features that correlate positively with PSS (albeit modestly).
  - Lower circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −0.43) and modestly elevated resting HR (Z ≈ +0.53), both of which have small associations with higher PSS in this sample.
  - Nocturnal-to-morning HR deviations (large negative early-morning deviations) that show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS for several early hours.
- Irregular sleep timing/amounts (sleep start SD ≈ 65 min; duration SD ≈ 86 min) that have small positive correlations with PSS.
- Overall integrated summary in the report: physiology tilts toward greater stress even though self-report measures are low — the author judged PSS to be near the mean with a plausible modest upward deviation when weighting physiology.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean 21.5)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (“Disturbed Sleep”), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42), so this is a plausible contributor to elevated perceived stress for this participant.
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate hourly deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), though these are smaller effects.

Comparative weighing of evidence (within each study’s frame)
- Strength and direction of signals for Participant 2 overwhelmingly indicate lower-than-mean stress: maximal self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.79) and very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ −1.38) map to large correlations with PSS (NGSE–PSS r ≈ −0.60; GAD–PSS r ≈ +0.75). Objective physiology strongly supports low stress (high interdaily stability, high amplitude, strong autocorrelation, very low RHR Z ≈ −2.23). The main counter-signal is PSQI = 7, but it is an isolated subjective complaint against multiple strong indicators of low PSS.
- For Participant 1, subjective psychopathology measures are clearly below average (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem), pulling strongly toward lower PSS. However, multiple physiological indices that correlate (modestly) with higher PSS are present (intradaily variability, reduced amplitude/stability, elevated resting HR, sleep irregularity). The correlations for these physiological features are smaller in magnitude than the strong psychometric correlations seen for Participant 2, and the study author concluded Participant 1 is near the population mean with a possible modest upward tilt when physiology is weighted.

Final judgment
- Participant 2’s profile is characterized by large, concordant psychometric and objective signals of lower perceived stress (below the local mean) with only one notable counter-signal (PSQI).  
- Participant 1’s profile is closer to the population mean but contains multiple physiological markers that align with higher PSS; the integrated assessment was “near the mean” with a plausible modest tilt upward.

Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS (i.e., more perceived stress) when comparing the two participants relative to their respective study means.

- Late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:17, sleep-start SD ≈ 135 min, Z ≈ 1.14); sleep‑timing irregularity is positively associated with PSS in the cohort.

- High self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 40, Z ≈ 0.26) and low intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ −1.45) suggesting less fragmented activity.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16.5, Z = 1.0) and PSQI has a moderate–strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.47).  
- Extremely short median sleep duration (2 h 38 min, Z ≈ −0.94) and very high night‑to‑night sleep onset variability (SD 281 min, Z ≈ 1.3) — objective features tightly tied to higher stress.  
- Pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal (overnight HR deviations +13.5 bpm and +9.8 bpm with Zs ≈ 1.17–1.59); these overnight elevations have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).  
- Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) combined with a very strong sample correlation between GAD‑7 and PSS (r ≈ 0.78) — reaching a screening threshold for clinically relevant anxiety substantially raises likelihood of above‑mean PSS.  
- Pain/interference (PAPAS) modestly elevated and positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).

Countervailing (protective) signals for Participant 2
- Higher-than-average self‑efficacy (New General Self‑Efficacy Z ≈ 0.3) and low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 subscale Z ≈ −0.97). These are sizable protective factors in this sample (notably strong negative correlations with PSS).  
- Some daytime cardiovascular features not strongly indicative of elevated stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study population means. That said, Participant 2 presents multiple, convergent, and relatively strong risk signals that are known in this dataset to be highly predictive of higher PSS: severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI), extremely short and highly irregular objective sleep, marked nocturnal HR arousal, and anxiety at a clinically relevant threshold — several of these features have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.47; GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.32–0.38; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).  
- Participant 1’s strongest risk is elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.25), plus late/irregular sleep timing and modestly elevated MESOR/RHR, but several meaningful protective factors (good PSQI, high self‑esteem, low IV) moderate overall risk. The magnitude and number of high-impact, convergent predictors for Participant 1 are smaller than for Participant 2.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows more severe and more numerous objective and subjective indicators that are strongly associated with higher PSS in that study (especially severe sleep disturbance/short sleep and nocturnal physiological arousal, plus anxiety), and these outweigh the protective traits. Participant 1 has elevated anxiety but less severe objective sleep disruption and stronger protective signals. Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS), relative to their population mean.

- Strong, clinically severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51). Anxiety in this sample has a very large correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.75), making this a powerful predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) that is correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), reinforcing the anxiety signal.
- High pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) which positively correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42) and plausibly increase daily strain and perceived stress.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a strong negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), indicating reduced coping confidence.
- Objective nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive nocturnal HR deviations (several Zs >2) and late, short sleep (median start ~01:42, ~4 h 55 m), concordant with subjective insomnia/hyperarousal and with PSS-related HR windows (some HR windows r ≈ 0.34).
- Multiple of these indicators have relatively large effect sizes (Zs and correlations) and coherently point toward above‑mean perceived stress in that study.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Short and very late sleep (median 5 h 46 m, Z ≈ -1.76; sleep start ~02:39) — sleep deprivation/timing has known links to higher perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.15), lower interdaily stability and modestly elevated intradaily variability — blunted/irregular circadian physiology that modestly correlates with PSS (small effect sizes).
- Elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.14) — small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14) suggest modest physiological strain.
- These objective markers collectively suggest physiological/behavioral strain that can drive higher perceived stress, although effect sizes here are generally small to modest.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is characterized as above their study’s PSS mean (population mean 20.62) based on multiple strong symptom and physiological indicators; Participant 2 is characterized as near their study’s PSS mean (population mean 21.61), with a split profile (robustly low self‑report distress vs. objective sleep/circadian strain).
- The predictors in Participant 1 that point toward higher PSS are both larger in magnitude (higher Zs) and include measures with stronger correlations to PSS in that sample (notably anxiety r ≈ 0.75 and NGSE r ≈ -0.61). Nocturnal HR deviations in Participant 1 include very large Zs (e.g., ~2.8) that align with subjective distress.
- In Participant 2, the indicators that pull toward higher PSS are primarily objective sleep/circadian measures whose correlations with PSS are smaller (r values modest) and are contradicted by multiple robust self‑report indices of low distress (large-magnitude protective Zs for self‑esteem, happiness, low depression and anxiety).
- Put differently: Participant 1 shows strong, concordant psychological symptom signals (and supporting physiological arousal) that have high predictive value for PSS; Participant 2 shows discordant signals (objective physiological risk but strong subjective resilience and small effect sizes linking those physiology metrics to PSS).

- The evidence for elevated perceived stress is stronger and more coherent for Participant 1 (multiple large Zs, measures with high correlations to PSS, concordant nocturnal physiology) than for Participant 2 (physiological signs of strain present but counterbalanced by strong low‑distress self‑reports and generally smaller effect sizes).
- Therefore Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

9,57359,12,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s sample frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6): crosses the common threshold for disturbed sleep, and subjective poor sleep is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Lower self-rated happiness and somewhat lower health satisfaction (both below the sample mean), which correlate with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral markers consistent with stress-related coping or risk: above-average alcohol frequency (z ≈ +1) and substantial internet use (z ≈ +0.85).
- Reduced 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate (z ≈ -1.03), suggesting weaker day-to-day circadian regularity that can be associated with stress or schedule irregularity.
- Divergence between long objective sleep and poor subjective sleep (possible sleep quality complaints despite long duration), which can reflect sleep-related distress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r = 0.46).
- Very short objective sleep duration (median ~3 h 27 m) and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD ≈ 197 min), both of which plausibly increase perceived stress.
- High intradaily variability in rest–activity (Z = 2.29), which in this sample trends toward higher PSS.
- Increased daytime napping and an elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale), which could contribute to stress.

Comparative weighing of evidence (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Directional summaries: Participant 1’s integrated assessment explicitly concludes stress is “near the mean or modestly below” their study mean; Participant 2’s integrated assessment explicitly concludes the profile “leans toward lower perceived stress” (below their study mean).
- Strength of indicators favoring lower stress:
  - For Participant 1: objective physiology (low resting HR, preserved diurnal amplitude), slightly below-average depression and trait-anxiety scores, stable interdaily rhythm, and good academic functioning argue against substantially elevated PSS. These are moderate-to-strong signals in that summary.
  - For Participant 2: very strong sample-level predictors point to lower PSS — notably low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -0.94) and high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.49) — and these measures have large correlations with PSS in the sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). The summary treats these as powerful indicators of lower perceived stress.
- Strength of indicators favoring higher stress:
  - For Participant 1: mostly moderate signals (PSQI just above threshold, increased alcohol/internet use, lower happiness) and one circadian irregularity metric; none are described as strongly predictive in this sample.
  - For Participant 2: very large objective sleep deficit (3.5 hours/night) and very high intradaily variability (Z = 2.29) are notable and plausibly elevate perceived stress; PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS in this sample.
- Net balance:
  - Participant 1: mixed but overall the summary leans toward near-mean or modestly below-mean PSS; stress-related signals are present but not dominant.
  - Participant 2: mixed overall but the summary emphasizes that the strongest, most highly correlated predictors (low anxiety and high self-efficacy) point to lower PSS despite severe sleep problems. The authors judge Participant 2 to be below the population mean.

Conclusion
- Both profiles are mixed, but Participant 2’s profile is explicitly characterized as below their population mean with strong predictors supporting that inference, whereas Participant 1’s profile is closer to the population mean (and possibly modestly below) and contains multiple moderate indicators of stress. Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress of the two.

5,64572,14,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe and convergent sleep disruption:
  - PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.50).
  - Wearable median sleep ≈ 3 hr 4 min (extremely short).
  - Very large night-to-night sleep timing variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82).
  - These objective and subjective sleep signals are extreme and align with higher PSS.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability:
  - GAD-7 = 9 (mild anxiety) with a very strong correlation to PSS in the sample (r = 0.78).
  - BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (r = 0.68 with PSS).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference:
  - Substance Abuse subscale high (Z = 1.75) and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS.
- Circadian/physiological instability:
  - Low interdaily stability (Z = -1.42), low amplitude (Z = -1.10), reduced 24-hr autocorrelation — rhythm metrics that in this dataset associate with higher PSS.
- Protective factors are present but weaker relative to the above signals:
  - Very high self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79) and lower resting HR/mesor (Z’s ≈ -0.55 to -0.66) mitigate risk but do not outweigh multiple, strongly PSS-associated indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some sleep- and evening-arousal–related signals:
  - PSQI = 6 (clinically meaningful disturbance), median sleep ~6 h 38 min (shorter than average, Z = -0.69).
  - Late typical sleep start (~00:42) and modest timing variability.
  - Pronounced evening heart-rate deviations (e.g., 8–9 pm deviation = +23.6, Z = 2.47) that could impede wind-down and sleep.
  - Slightly lower momentary happiness and health satisfaction (small negative Z’s).
- However, many signals point toward lower perceived stress:
  - Low depressive (CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97) and trait-anxiety (STAI-Trait Z = -0.62) scores.
  - High interdaily stability (Z = 1.66) and preserved rhythm amplitude (Z = 0.49).
  - Low resting HR (50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93), no substance use, regular exercise, above-average self-esteem and trust — robust protective factors.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both participant summaries are already anchored relative to their own population means (P1: mean PSS = 21.33; P2: mean PSS = 21.61).
- Participant 1’s profile was interpreted by the original summary as above that population mean; the inference is driven by multiple measures that have strong positive correlations with PSS in that sample (notably sleep metrics and GAD-7) and by objectively extreme sleep disruption.
- Participant 2’s profile was interpreted as below its population mean; although there are sleep and evening-arousal flags that could raise PSS somewhat, most high-weight indicators (low depression/anxiety scores, high interdaily stability, healthy behaviors, no substance use) point toward lower perceived stress than their sample mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 shows multiple, strongly correlated indicators of elevated perceived stress, including extremely short and irregular sleep (objective + subjective), anxiety-related symptoms with high correlation to PSS, substance-related difficulties, and circadian instability. These signals are both large in magnitude and consistent across modalities.
- Participant 2 exhibits some moderate sleep-related and evening-arousal signals that could elevate stress, but the preponderance of fairly strong protective indicators (low depression/anxiety, high rhythm regularity, low resting HR, healthy behaviors, no substance use) suggests overall lower perceived stress relative to that population mean.
- Given the severity and multimodal convergence of stress-related indicators in Participant 1 versus the primarily protective profile in Participant 2, Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher PSS score.

13,95559,28,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean = 20.75)
- Elevated self-report indicators that have strong positive correlations with PSS in this cohort:
  - Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5) — very strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.80).
  - Emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 6.33) — strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.67).
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9) — correlated with PSS (r = 0.59).
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) — positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).
- Nighttime HR deviations at several nocturnal hours that are positively associated with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), suggesting physiological arousal linked to subjective stress.
- The study author explicitly infers this participant’s PSS is above their population mean based on the weighting of these survey signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.62)
- Wearable-derived circadian/sleep disruptions that in this dataset associate (albeit modestly) with higher PSS:
  - Very low interdaily stability (IS z = −1.98) and low 24-h autocorrelation (z = −1.29); both negatively correlate with PSS (IS r = −0.12; autocorr r = −0.17).
  - Reduced circadian amplitude (z = −1.16), which correlates negatively with PSS (r = −0.17).
  - Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and very late median sleep onset (~02:10 AM).
  - High nap frequency (z = 2.07), which correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.14).
  - Elevated alcohol use and low exercise frequency (behavioral features sometimes linked to higher stress; correlations with PSS are small).
- The summary notes a modest tendency for PSS to be elevated relative to the population mean due to these objective markers.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Strength and direction of signals:
  - Participant 1’s indicators favoring higher PSS are dominated by subjective measures that have strong correlations with PSS in their cohort (GAD-7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67; PSQI r = 0.59). Those high-weight, self-report predictors provide a robust signal that this person is above their population mean.
  - Participant 2’s indicators suggesting higher PSS are mainly objective circadian/sleep disruptions whose correlations with PSS in their cohort are modest (r values roughly 0.12–0.17). Crucially, Participant 2’s self-report affective measures (CES‑D and trait STAI) are below their population mean and are themselves predictive of lower PSS.
- Overall balance:
  - For Participant 1 the strongest predictors of PSS are elevated and point clearly above the mean; protective wearable signals are present but judged by the study to be moderating rather than overturning the self-report signal.
  - For Participant 2 there is a conflict: objective wearable markers lean toward higher stress but with small effect sizes, while subjective inventories (which more directly map onto perceived stress) lean toward lower-than-average stress. The study’s conclusion places Participant 2 near the population mean with only a modest tilt toward elevation.
- Given that PSS is a subjective construct and correlates more strongly with self-reported affect, the presence of multiple strong, survey-based predictors in Participant 1 (vs. mainly modest wearable-based signals in Participant 2) argues that Participant 1 is likely to have the worse (higher) perceived stress relative to their peers.

21,98117,30,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s population mean = 20.67)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 12; z ≈ +0.46) — this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77), so even a moderate z-score is a high-weight predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; z ≈ +1.32) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.45) and this is a substantial deviation above the sample mean.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations at multiple overnight hours (hourly z-scores up to ≈ +1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (≈ 0.22–0.39), consistent with nocturnal autonomic arousal/poor recovery.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) together with a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.66) supports susceptibility to greater perceived stress.
- Elevated substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ +1.5) — stress-relevant behavioral risk even if its correlation with PSS here is small.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.61)
- Markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33; z ≈ +2.05). Depression correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), and this is a large deviation.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ +1.16), which also correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8, above clinical cutoff) plus extremely large sleep-timing irregularity (sleep start median 04:03; sleep start SD z ≈ +4.33) and very high variability in total sleep duration (SD z ≈ +3.02). Those large deviations are associated with higher PSS in the sample and reflect severe circadian/sleep disruption.
- Behavioral correlates of distress: very low social engagement (z ≈ −2.20), very high recreational internet use (z ≈ +2.19), and minimal exercise — multiple behavioral markers that typically co-occur with higher perceived stress / poorer mood.
- Wearable physiology mildly consistent with stress: elevated resting HR and mesor (z ≈ +0.96 to +0.98) and slightly reduced HR amplitude (z ≈ −0.42) — directionally consistent with higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1 shows several high-impact predictors of PSS (notably the strong GAD-7 → PSS linkage and very poor PSQI) but the magnitudes of deviation (z-scores) are generally modest-to-moderate (GAD z ~+0.46; PSQI z ~+1.32; HR overnight up to ~+1.0). Some strong protective/neutral signals (lower resting HR, adequate objective sleep duration, low pain) partly offset the psychological signals.
- Participant 2 exhibits multiple, large-magnitude deviations from their sample mean across several domains (CES-D z ≈ +2.05; sleep-timing irregularity z ≈ +4.33; sleep-duration variability z ≈ +3.02; social engagement z ≈ −2.20; internet use z ≈ +2.19). Although individual correlations with PSS for some measures (e.g., CES-D) are more modest than the GAD→PSS correlation in Participant 1, the sheer number and amplitude of stress-linked deviations in Participant 2 (particularly severe mood symptoms and extreme sleep/circadian disruption) produce a stronger, multi-domain signature of elevated perceived stress relative to their population mean.
- In sum, Participant 1 has a few strongly PSS-linked features but of moderate magnitude, with some physiological protections; Participant 2 has multiple large-magnitude, convergent risk signals (mood, sleep irregularity, behavioral isolation, physiologic elevation) that together are more indicative of higher perceived stress relative to their peers.

- Clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; z ≈ +1.05) and objectively short median sleep (6 h 28 min; z ≈ -0.88) — sleep problems are a common, moderate predictor of higher PSS in this cohort.  
- Late and variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:16; sleep start SD z ≈ +0.43) and elevated nap frequency (z ≈ +1.21) — circadian misalignment/compensatory sleep behaviors often accompany higher perceived stress.  
- Modest elevations on mood-related self-report that correlate with PSS in this sample (CES‑D = 14; STAI–Trait classified “anxious”), plus lower self‑esteem (z = -0.87) and reduced happiness (z ≈ -0.53) — psychosocial strain that tends to co-occur with higher stress.  
- Small positive intradaily variability and some early-morning HR deviations that align with PSS (weakly correlated), suggesting subtle physiological reactivity.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their sample):
- Substantially disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5; r with PSS ≈ 0.48) and profoundly short objective sleep (median 3 h 30 min; median sleep start ≈ 03:37 AM) — very large sleep abnormalities strongly linked to higher PSS.  
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS z ≈ +0.43) with moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (late-night/early-morning windows; z up to ~0.67) that have substantial sample correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.43), plus reduced circadian amplitude and autocorrelation—physiologic signs that map onto higher perceived stress.  
- These sleep, pain, and nocturnal-arousal signals are large and concordant, and several have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in the sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Magnitude and relevance of indicators: Participant 2 exhibits much larger and more concordant abnormalities on measures that have relatively strong sample-level associations with PSS (very short sleep duration, high PSQI, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations). These are high-impact predictors in their cohort. Participant 1’s risk signals (PSQI = 9, late/variable sleep, modest depressive/anxiety indicators) are present but generally less extreme.  
- Protective/mitigating signals: Participant 1 shows strong objective protective signals (low resting HR z ≈ -1.18, low MESOR, above-average interdaily stability and 24h autocorrelation), which are negatively associated with PSS in that sample and substantially mitigate the subjective sleep complaints. Participant 2 has important protective self-report factors (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) that reduce certainty, but these do not fully offset the very large sleep/pain/nocturnal-arousal abnormalities.  
- Effect-size context: Several of Participant 2’s elevated features have larger Z-scores and/or larger sample correlations with PSS than Participant 1’s elevated features. That increases the likelihood that Participant 2’s perceived stress is further above their study mean than Participant 1’s is above theirs.

Overall judgment:
- Balancing severity, number, and sample-level predictive strength of elevated features, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) overall perceived stress compared with Participant 1.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (Z = 0.59), classified as disturbed sleep and positively associated with PSS.
- Irregular/delayed sleep timing and circadian disruption: very late median sleep onset (~03:48 AM), sleep start SD ≈ 94 min, intradaily variability Z = 0.32 and interdaily stability slightly below mean (Z = -0.24); these are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Evening/night physiological arousal: large positive HR deviations around midnight–3 AM (Z-scores >2–4) and an evening acrophase—an objective correlate of stress-related arousal.

Reasons Participant 1 might not be strongly high on PSS (buffers)
- Relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.82) and momentary happiness (Z = 0.55), both negatively correlated with PSS.
- Low mesor and low resting HR (Z = -1.49 and Z = -1.11), suggesting lower tonic physiological arousal or fitness.
- Median nightly sleep duration is adequate (≈7h49m; Z = 0.79), which may mitigate some functional consequences of late timing.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (strongly correlated with PSS, r = 0.50) and objective median sleep ~3 h/night with enormous night-to-night timing variability (sleep start SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). These are extreme signals strongly tied to higher PSS.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9.0 with very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (Z = 0.43, r = 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS—plausible contributors to perceived stress.
- Marked circadian/rhythm disruption: low interdaily stability (Z = -1.42), low amplitude (Z = -1.10), reduced 24-hr autocorrelation (Z = -0.68) — objective rhythm metrics associated with greater stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might not be as high on PSS (buffers)
- Very high general self-efficacy (NGSE = 40; Z = 1.79) with a strong negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.63); this is a robust protective factor.
- Lower resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ -0.55 and -0.66), suggesting lower tonic physiological arousal.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Both profiles are interpreted relative to their own study means, which are nearly identical (P1 mean = 21.62; P2 mean = 21.33). Thus comparison should focus on the strength and extremity of PSS-linked signals within each description.
- Participant 1 shows several indicators pointing above the population mean, but most effects are modest (small-to-moderate Z-scores and correlations). Protective factors (high self-esteem/happiness and notably low resting HR) are substantial and the participant’s median sleep duration is adequate, so the net inference is only modestly above mean.
- Participant 2 presents multiple, convergent, and often large signals that are strongly correlated with PSS in that sample: objectively and subjectively extreme sleep reduction/irregularity, strong anxiety symptoms (high correlation r = 0.78), emotional lability (r = 0.68), and substance-related problems. Several of these have large Z-scores (e.g., sleep timing variability Z = 2.82; substance abuse Z = 1.75). Although high self-efficacy is a strong protective factor, it is unlikely to fully offset the severity and multiplicity of stress-linked disturbances (especially the near-total sleep loss).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2’s profile contains more extreme and more strongly PSS‑correlated indicators (very short median sleep, very large sleep-timing variability, high GAD-7 with very large sample correlation, substance problems), producing a stronger and more consistent signal for elevated perceived stress relative to that study’s mean.
- Participant 1 shows above-mean stress indicators but of smaller magnitude and with stronger physiological/psychological buffers.

3,23576,13,21,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, above clinical cutoff) — a direct subjective complaint that can elevate perceived stress even when objective sleep looks adequate.
- Later median sleep start (~00:38) — later timing can co-occur with evening arousal or lifestyle stress in some people.
- Small objective signs of physiological fragmentation/activation (slightly elevated intradaily HR variability Z = 0.24 and afternoon HR elevations) that in the sample show small positive correlations with PSS.
- Note: these risk signals are small in magnitude and inconsistent with many strong protective signals (low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem, good objective sleep duration/regularity, frequent exercise), so they point only to modest upward pressure on PSS relative to this cohort.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), so this is a relatively strong risk factor.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG/PAPAS elevated) which have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54) that can reduce perceived social support and contribute to stress.
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), suggesting higher basal physiological arousal (though correlations with PSS are weak).
- Note: these risks are counterbalanced by strong protective factors (high NGSE Z = 1.41, very strong circadian regularity Zs, low emotional lability, low substance use). The write-up concludes P2’s inferred PSS is near or slightly below the population mean, but the above risk factors are more substantial than the minor risks reported for P1.

Comparative reasoning (within each population frame)
- Participant 1’s profile is predominantly protective relative to their cohort (multiple favorable Zs across mood, sleep regularity, exercise, circadian measures) with only mild subjective sleep complaints and small physiological hints of activation. The original summary judged P1 likely below the sample mean (21.62).
- Participant 2 has a mixed profile: very strong protective resources (notably NGSE and pronounced circadian regularity) but also several moderately strong risk indicators (high PSQI, pain/interference, interpersonal strain). The original summary judged P2 near the sample mean (21.38), perhaps slightly below, but closer to average than P1 is.
- The most consequential difference is that P2’s subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5) and pain/interference are larger, better-correlated risk factors for PSS in that sample than the relatively minor risks seen for P1 (PSQI = 6 and small HR variability). Even though P2 has stronger protective factors, those protections were described as balancing (not overwhelmingly cancelling) the risk signals, leaving P2 closer to the mean.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS (i.e., worse perceived stress) compared with Participant 1, because P2 shows larger-magnitude, better-correlated risk signals (notably very poor subjective sleep and pain/interference) and is characterized as near the population mean, whereas P1 is characterized more definitively as below the population mean with mostly protective indicators.

- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r ≈ 0.63), increased pain and functional interference (PEG-3 elevated; PAPAS elevated), and lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; r with PSS ≈ -0.66) — together these subjective domains converge on higher perceived stress.
- Holistic conclusion provided: P2 is judged to have PSS above their cohort mean (20.54), with subjective measures carrying heavy weight.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or not elevated) PSS (within their cohort):
- Wearable-derived physiology suggests resilience: low resting heart rate and mesor (RHR ≈ 55 bpm; mesor Z ≈ -0.9 to -1.35), higher interdaily stability (Z = 0.65), low intradaily variability (Z = -0.59), and preserved amplitude (Z = 0.56) — features that correlate negatively or weakly with PSS and indicate organized circadian/physiological patterns.
- However, the summary emphasizes that the strong subjective signals outweigh these objective protective features when predicting PSS.

Comparative reasoning (taking each description relative to its own population mean):
- Participant 1: described as near the sample mean PSS (21.61) and, when psychosocial/sleep buffers are weighted, slightly below the mean. Objective elevations in RHR and intraday variability are modest and not supported by strong subjective distress signals.
- Participant 2: explicitly described as above the sample mean PSS (20.54), with very large subjective symptom elevations (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability) that are the strongest available predictors of PSS in that cohort. Objective physiology for P2 is relatively organized but considered secondary to the strong subjective signal.
- The magnitudes and correlations matter: P2’s subjective z-scores (≈1.0–1.65) and very high predictor correlations (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.74) are larger and more directly tied to PSS than P1’s objective deviations (mostly sub-1.0 Zs and weaker correlations) and protective psychosocial indicators.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 2 shows convergent and strong subjective indicators that predict higher-than-average perceived stress relative to their cohort; these carry more weight in predicting PSS than the protective objective signals.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and very short objective nightly sleep (median ≈ 3 h 27 min), both of which correlate with higher PSS in this cohort (PSQI r ≈ +0.46).  
- High intradaily variability (IV = 0.64, Z ≈ +2.29) and fragmented rest–activity patterns (IV r ≈ +0.24), which in this sample trend toward higher PSS.  
- Increased nap frequency and some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal score elevated) that could contribute to perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑frame reasoning
- Participant 1’s strongest risk signals are elevated depressive and trait anxiety scores (both Z ≈ +1.4) that have moderate positive correlations with PSS in that study. These affective indicators are explicitly identified as the principal basis for inferring above‑mean PSS, and protective circadian/behavioral features are described as only partially offsetting that risk.  
- Participant 2 shows severe sleep problems that strongly suggest risk for higher perceived stress, but the profile also contains very strong protective predictors in that participant’s study: notably low GAD‑7 (Z ≈ −0.94) and relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.49). Critically, GAD‑7 and NGSE have large sample‑level associations with PSS (r ≈ +0.76 and r ≈ −0.65, respectively), which the summary judges to outweigh the sleep‑related risks and lead to an inferred below‑mean PSS for Participant 2.  
- In short, Participant 1’s above‑mean inference is driven by elevated mood/anxiety scores that are moderate predictors of PSS, whereas Participant 2’s above‑mean risk from sleep restriction is counterbalanced by very strong protective indicators (low generalized anxiety and high self‑efficacy) with larger sample‑level associations to PSS.

Overall judgment
- Taking the balance of evidence within each study frame, Participant 1 is inferred to have higher perceived stress relative to their population mean, while Participant 2 is inferred to have lower perceived stress relative to their population mean. Comparing those within‑study inferences, Participant 1 therefore likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

19,60396,28,21,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean):
- Mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 42; positive correlation with PSS in this sample, r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and late habitual sleep onset (~01:46), both commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Some overnight/early-morning heart-rate deviations that correlate positively with PSS (small-to-moderate r ≈ 0.14–0.21).
- Reduced daytime socializing and relatively frequent alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1.0) that can co-occur with or maintain stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean):
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16.5; Z = +1.0) and strong PSQI–PSS relationship in this sample (r = 0.47).
- Extreme objective sleep impairment (median sleep ≈ 2 h 38 min, Z ≈ -0.94) and very late, highly variable sleep timing (median start 03:12 AM; onset SD Z ≈ +1.3).
- Marked nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (large positive HR deviations overnight; Zs up to ≈ +1.6) with moderate correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) when anxiety–PSS correlation in this sample is especially strong (r = 0.78).
- Pain-related functional interference (PAPAS) that correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.48).

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Participant 1’s stress-relevant signals are mixed: some risk signs (sleep complaints, late timing, mild anxiety, some overnight HR features) but multiple protective and strong buffering signals (low depressive symptoms, high happiness/health satisfaction, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR, frequent group exercise). The study summary explicitly concludes P1 is near the population mean (i.e., not markedly above).
- Participant 2’s profile shows several strong, convergent drivers of higher perceived stress relative to their population: extremely poor subjective and objective sleep, pronounced nocturnal physiological arousal, and clinically relevant anxiety—each of which has relatively strong correlations with PSS in that study (notably GAD-7 r = 0.78, PSQI r = 0.47). Although P2 has protective traits (higher self-efficacy, low emotional lability), the dominant signals point toward above-mean perceived stress.
- The magnitude and number of stress-linked indicators are greater and more directly tied to PSS in Participant 2’s description than in Participant 1’s, and the text summaries themselves characterize P2 as likely above their study mean and P1 as near theirs.

10,17932,10,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42), so this could raise perceived stress relative to peers.
- Nocturnal HR deviations: specific early-morning heart-rate deviations (Z ≈ -2 to -2.7) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These are weaker signals but could modestly contribute to higher PSS.

Contextual note: these are relatively modest countervailing signals in a profile that otherwise shows very strong indicators of lower stress (maximal self-efficacy, minimal anxiety, low emotional/interpersonal distress, strong circadian metrics, very low resting HR). The summary places this participant below the study mean (21.5).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (Z ≈ 2.9), a very large signal associated with elevated perceived stress in prior work.
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:24 AM) and some elevated late-evening HR deviations, consistent with evening hyperarousal or poor sleep hygiene that can increase stress perception.
- Lower self-rated happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and below-average social trust (Z ≈ -1.1), which can permissively increase perceived stress.

Contextual note: these stress‑increasing signals are balanced against many protective indicators (low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, low resting HR, robust circadian stability, long objective sleep duration, regular exercise, good academic performance). The summary places this participant near or slightly below their study mean (21.62), i.e., closer to the population average than Participant 1 is to theirs.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is described as clearly below their population mean PSS (strong, multiple convergent protective signals; only mild/moderate counterevidence from subjective sleep and small nocturnal HR correlations).
- Participant 2 is described as near or slightly below their population mean PSS, with a very large subjective sleep complaint that pulls the otherwise low-stress profile upward toward the mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1’s deviations toward higher stress are modest and isolated; multiple strong indicators point well below the mean.
- Participant 2 has a pronounced, high‑Z subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13) and behavioral signs (late sleep onset) that more substantially elevate perceived stress relative to their peers, even though other markers are protective.
- Therefore Participant 2 is likely to exhibit a higher PSS (i.e., more perceived stress) than Participant 1 when comparing each to their own study population means.

21,93002,30,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score:
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 12) — a strong predictor here (correlation with PSS ≈ 0.77).  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, z = +1.32) — moderately correlated with PSS.  
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: multiple overnight hourly heart-rate deviations substantially above sample mean (e.g., +11.9 bpm around midnight) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association to PSS, consistent with greater perceived stress vulnerability.  
- Elevated substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ +1.5) suggesting stress‑related behavior risk (even if its correlation with PSS here is weak).  
Mitigating factors for Participant 1 (reduce likelihood/severity of high PSS):
- Objective sleep duration is above median (≈7h19m), stable sleep duration, lower resting HR and modestly preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation, and low pain scores — all indicators that temper the stress signal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score:
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9, z ≈ +1.05) and short median sleep duration (6h28m, z ≈ -0.88) with notable night-to-night variability.  
- Late, variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:16; sleep start SD elevated) and increased nap frequency (z ≈ +1.21) — behaviors linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Some psychosocial strain: lower self‑esteem (Rosenberg z ≈ -0.87), reduced happiness (z ≈ -0.53), CES‑D and STAI indicators in the anxious/depressive range (though modest).  
- Small early-morning HR deviations and modest intradaily variability that correlate weakly with PSS.
Mitigating factors for Participant 2:
- Strong protective physiological/circadian indicators: very low resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ -1.18, -1.24), good interdaily stability and 24h autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.67 to +0.81) — features associated with lower perceived stress.  
- Low substance use and preserved behavioral regularity that argue against a strongly elevated PSS.

Comparative, within-frame reasoning:
- Each description is relative to its own study cohort. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their cohort mean PSS (population mean = 20.67) based on multiple high-impact signals (notably high anxiety and very poor subjective sleep plus nocturnal HR elevations). The assessment confidence is moderate.  
- Participant 2 is characterized as near their cohort mean PSS (population mean = 21.61), possibly slightly above, because subjective sleep and psychosocial signals point upward but several robust physiological/circadian protections weaken the inference. The assessment carries more uncertainty and centers near the mean rather than clearly above it.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 1 shows stronger, higher-impact indicators that are highly correlated with PSS (especially GAD-7 and severe PSQI) and physiological nocturnal arousal that aligns with higher perceived stress.  
- Participant 2 shows mixed signals with subjective complaints but stronger objective physiological/circadian protections and an overall classification of near the cohort mean.

- Shorter and late sleep (median nightly ~6h52m, bedtime ~01:07; Z ≈ -0.4 and late start) — can modestly increase perceived stress.
- Low solo exercise and very limited social time (social time 16–30 min, substantial negative Z) — reduced behavioral buffers against stress.
- These behavioral risks are modest in magnitude and the reported correlations with PSS are small, so they provide only weak upward pressure on PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16, Z = 0.83) with PSQI–PSS correlation r ≈ 0.58 — a substantive predictor of higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ 0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ 0.8) with moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56) — likely to increase perceived stress.
- Wearable indicators consistent with nocturnal disturbance (very short median wearable sleep 1h44m, variable sleep start SD ≈ 160 min, some overnight HR elevations) — these align with the self‑reported sleep problems and add upward pressure on PSS (though median wearable sleep could be biased by non‑wear).
- Protective factors exist (very low GAD-7, high self‑efficacy, regular circadian metrics, low RHR) that push PSS down, but the sleep and pain signals are the clearest specific drivers toward higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its own study mean; the study means are nearly identical (Participant 1 population mean 21.62; Participant 2 population mean 21.5), so relative comparisons across participants are reasonable.
- Participant 1 is characterized by multiple convergent indicators of lower-than-mean perceived stress (very low CES‑D, below-mean STAI, high self‑esteem and happiness, robust circadian HR amplitude and interdaily stability, low resting HR). The behavioral risks (short/late sleep, low exercise/social time) are small in magnitude and weakly correlated with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is described as overall near the population mean but with specific, moderately strong drivers of higher perceived stress — notably elevated PSQI and pain/interference — that are empirically well-correlated with PSS in that sample. Although Participant 2 also has strong protective indicators (very low GAD-7, good self‑efficacy, stable circadian metrics), the synthesis in the report places them near the mean with a modest upward contribution from sleep disturbance and pain.
- Taking the within-sample frames together: Participant 1 is most plausibly below their study mean PSS; Participant 2 is plausibly at-or-slightly-above their study mean PSS. Given the similar population means, Participant 2’s profile is therefore the one indicating the higher perceived stress level.

- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 11, Z ≈ +1.98 (nearly 2 SD above their sample mean), a strong stress-related signal.
- Short sleep duration and circadian misalignment: median nightly sleep ≈ 5 h 59 min (Z ≈ -1.5) and very late median sleep onset (~03:44 AM) — both strongly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive heart‑rate deviation at 1–2 AM (Z ≈ +2.04), consistent with nighttime arousal and with sleep disruption.
- Reduced circadian regularity and amplitude: interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.32 and amplitude Z ≈ -1.0, indicating blunted, irregular 24‑h rhythm linked to stress.
- Trait vulnerability and behavioral risks: elevated trait anxiety (STAI Trait Z ≈ +0.46), low self‑esteem (Z ≈ -1.01), low exercise (Z ≈ -1.58), and frequent recreational drug use (very high Zs) — a cluster that plausibly elevates perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Disturbed sleep and pain/functioning: PSQI = 15.5 (Z ≈ +0.67) and PAPAS pain Z ≈ +0.93; both have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -0.62; NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.69).
- Nocturnal physiological elevations: positive night‑time HR deviations (Zs up to ≈ +1.38) and elevated mesor/RHR (Z ≈ +0.7 and +0.61) that correlate with higher PSS in this study.
- Reduced day-to-day regularity: interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.83, which modestly associates with higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning in the studies’ frames
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population mean PSS. The question is which appears worse relative to their own population.
- Participant 1 exhibits multiple large-magnitude deviations (PSQI Z ~ +1.98; short sleep Z ~ -1.5; nocturnal HR Z ~ +2.0; interdaily stability Z ~ -1.32) across subjective, behavioral, and physiological domains. Several of these (very poor sleep quality, very short sleep, pronounced nocturnal arousal and circadian irregularity) are tightly linked to perceived stress and are of larger absolute Z magnitude than most of Participant 2’s deviations.
- Participant 2 shows several coherent stress-related signals (pain, poorer PSQI, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR elevations), and some of these measures have strong sample correlations with PSS. However, the magnitudes of these deviations tend to be moderate (Zs generally in the ~0.6–1.0 range) rather than the more extreme values seen for Participant 1. Participant 2 also has notable protective features (low GAD-7 relative to the sample, longer nightly sleep, low intradaily variability) that likely blunt the net PSS elevation.
- In short, although Participant 2 has several measures that reliably track with PSS in their sample, Participant 1’s combination of more extreme sleep disturbance, shorter sleep, stronger nocturnal physiological arousal, and greater circadian irregularity suggests a larger departure from their population norms on stress‑relevant indicators.

Weighed judgment
- Considering magnitude of deviations, number of converging domains (subjective sleep, sleep duration, nocturnal HR, circadian regularity, behavioral risks), and limited protective offsets, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress relative to their study population.

13,33657,28,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Explicit inference in the summary: the integrative interpretation already concludes the participant’s perceived stress is likely above their study population mean (20.75).
- Strong self-report predictors that are highly correlated with PSS in this dataset:
  - Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 7.5) — GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).
  - Emotional lability (BASIS‑24 = 6.33) — also strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.67).
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9) — PSQI correlates with PSS (r = 0.59).
  - Pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) — moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).
- Some nocturnal heart‑rate deviations that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), supporting elevated stress-related arousal.
- Although wearable circadian measures are protective, the summary states these do not fully offset the strong, high‑weight survey signals tied to higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some risk indicators that in this cohort are associated with higher PSS:
  - Modest depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 16, z = 0.28).
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6).
  - Circadian irregularity/within‑day fragmentation (intradaily variability z = 0.74; interdaily stability z = −0.49), and intradaily variability correlates positively with PSS.
  - A pronounced daytime HR spike at 10–11am (HR deviation z = 2.71), which could reflect recurring arousal/stressors.
  - Relatively frequent naps (mean daily naps z = 2.23) and very high sedentary hobby z (3.19), behaviors that often co‑occur with higher distress.
- Despite these, the summary explicitly infers perceived stress near the study population mean (21.62), not clearly above it.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is calibrated to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is assessed as above the mean of 20.75; Participant 2 is assessed as near the mean of 21.62.
- The weight of evidence for Participant 1 rests on multiple strong self‑report predictors that have high correlations with PSS in that dataset (notably anxiety and emotional lability with very large r values). The summary explicitly judges those signals sufficient to place P1 above their cohort mean despite protective wearable signals.
- Participant 2 shows a mix of risk and protective signals; the protective signals (lower trait anxiety, higher happiness/self‑esteem, low resting HR, typical sleep duration) are described as roughly balancing risk signals, leading to a near‑mean inference.
- Absolute population mean difference (21.62 vs 20.75) is small (~0.9 points) and does not override the within‑participant inferences: because P1 is judged above their mean and P2 is judged near their mean (with several strong protective indicators), the balance favors P1 as having higher perceived stress.

Weighted judgment
- The stronger, higher‑weight self‑report correlates of PSS in Participant 1 (GAD‑7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain) vs. Participant 2’s mixed profile (risk signals of modest magnitude offset by several protective signals) indicate Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 m) and very high night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD = 216 min; z = 0.89) — objective markers strongly linked to elevated perceived stress.
- Large sleep-timing variability (SD sleep onset = 204 min) and reduced circadian regularity (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude) consistent with disrupted daily structure that commonly accompanies higher stress.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = +2.34), a salient contextual risk factor for ongoing stress.
- Blunted circadian heart-rate amplitude and irregular daily schedule (several rhythm measures z ≲ −1), which often co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, >5) and late habitual sleep onset (~01:46), suggesting circadian misalignment that can increase perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s study-frame)
- Participant 1’s strongest stress-linked signals are pronounced: extreme objective short sleep (median ~4.4 h), large sleep variability, high subjective sleep disturbance, and a very high interpersonal-strain z-score (+2.34). These are robust risk indicators relative to their population, despite some protective signs (very low anxiety, low pain, near-average self-efficacy, low resting HR).
- Participant 2 shows some stress-related features (PSQI >5, late sleep timing, mild trait anxiety), but many relatively strong protective factors in that participant’s population: adequate nightly sleep duration (~7 h 23 m), strong 24-h rhythmicity (autocorrelation z ≈ +1.57), low intradaily variability (z ≈ −1.45), low resting HR, regular group exercise, low depressive symptoms, and above-average happiness/health satisfaction. Overall, Participant 2’s risk signals are milder and counterbalanced by more protective signals than Participant 1’s profile.
- Considering the magnitude and clinical relevance of P1’s sleep deficit and interpersonal-strain (both large and stress-linked in this dataset) versus P2’s primarily moderate/mild risk markers, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to be above their study mean PSS to a greater degree than Participant 2 is above theirs.

- Markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.95) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 1.63), both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8, Z ≈ 0.59) and objectively shortened sleep (median ~6h26, Z ≈ −0.94).
- Strong wearable evidence of circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.48), reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −1.61), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.51) and very high night‑to‑night sleep timing variability (sleep‑start SD Z = 2.74). These features are associated with higher PSS in the dataset.
- Modestly elevated resting heart rate (Z ≈ 0.48) and some early‑morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS.
- Lower self‑esteem and lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ −1.01 and −1.03) which can reduce coping capacity.

Mitigating factors that reduce how high PSS might be: strong social engagement and hobby use (socializing Z = 2.53, music Z = 2.06), low substance use, preserved academic performance—these buffer stress and likely lower the absolute PSS relative to what the risk signals alone would predict.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their cohort mean = 20.62)
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, Z ≈ 1.51). In this sample anxiety has a large correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.75), making this a very strong predictor of elevated PSS.
- Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16, Z ≈ 0.83) and objectively short sleep (median ≈ 4 h 55 min) with late sleep timing—both linked to higher PSS.
- Large nocturnal physiological arousal: substantial positive hourly HR deviations overnight (e.g., 12–1 AM deviation Z = 2.83), which align with PSS‑related nocturnal HR windows.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS and reduce coping resources.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73), which in this sample correlates strongly (negatively) with PSS (r ≈ −0.61) and is a robust predictor of higher perceived stress.

Mitigating factors that reduce how high PSS might be: reasonably preserved circadian structure (interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.58, amplitude Z ≈ 0.91) and low intradaily fragmentation (Z ≈ −0.52), plus resting HR near average and low substance scores—these may blunt some stress impacts but are smaller in predictive strength than the severe symptom signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means. The question is which is likely worse in absolute perceived stress.
- Participant 1 exhibits large affective symptom burden (high STAI and CES‑D) and pronounced circadian/sleep timing irregularity (sleep‑start SD Z = 2.74, amplitude/interdaily stability deficits). However, the self‑report predictors in P1 have moderate correlations with PSS in that sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES‑D r ≈ 0.28), and there are substantial protective factors (very high social engagement, low substance use, preserved functioning) that plausibly attenuate PSS.
- Participant 2 shows multiple strong, high‑impact predictors of perceived stress: severe anxiety that is highly predictive of PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.75), very poor subjective sleep and objectively short sleep, marked nocturnal physiological arousal (large HR deviation Zs), substantial pain/interference, and low self‑efficacy (a robust negative predictor of PSS). Several of these predictors (anxiety, self‑efficacy, PSQI, pain) have larger correlations with PSS than the analogous predictors for Participant 1, and they co‑occur in P2, producing a convergent, high‑severity profile. The circadian regularity in P2 provides some resilience but does not outweigh the severity and predictive strength of the symptom signals.
- Relative to their cohorts, P2’s symptom pattern (especially severe anxiety and low self‑efficacy plus physiological nocturnal hyperarousal and very short sleep) is more strongly tied to elevated PSS than P1’s pattern is to PSS in its cohort.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Although both participants are described as above their study means, Participant 2 presents a set of predictors that are both larger in effect (high Zs on measures that have strong correlations with PSS) and more proximal to PSS (severe anxiety, low self‑efficacy, extreme sleep restriction and nocturnal HR arousal, pain). Participant 1 has important risk signals (anxiety, depression, circadian fragmentation) but also stronger and more numerous behavioral buffers and generally weaker predictor–PSS associations in that sample.
- Therefore, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 1.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):

- Large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 minutes) which can contribute to perceived stress.

Comparative assessment within each study-frame and weighing evidence:
- Direction of inference in each summary: Participant 1 was inferred above their population mean PSS; Participant 2 was inferred below their population mean PSS.
- Strength and breadth of predictors:
  - Participant 1’s signals for higher stress are convergent across affective measures (depression, anxiety), sleep/circadian irregularity, and an evening physiological arousal signal. However, the reported correlations of those affective predictors with PSS are small-to-moderate (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
  - Participant 2’s strongest predictors for lower stress are trait measures with large sample correlations to PSS: very low GAD-7 (z = -1.29; GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE; r ≈ -0.65). These are robust protective signals. The participant’s risk signals (severe short sleep, high PSQI, nocturnal HR) are important but their correlations with PSS are moderate (PSQI r ≈ 0.48; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.46) and are more circumscribed to sleep/nighttime.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s elevated depressive symptoms plus circadian/sleep irregularity provide multiple convergent indications of higher perceived stress relative to their population mean. Participant 2 shows a strong pattern of trait-level protective signals that are highly predictive of lower PSS in that sample, which outweigh the sleep-specific risk signals in the integrated inference.

Conclusion:
Given the relative strengths of predictive signals within each study frame (notably Participant 1’s elevated affective symptoms and circadian/sleep dysregulation vs. Participant 2’s very low anxiety and high self-efficacy that strongly predict lower PSS), Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9; correlation ≈ 0.66).
- Objective/behavioral signs consistent with stress risk:
  - Very short median sleep duration (~3 h 55 m).
  - Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (HR amplitude Z ≈ −1.51; interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.75), and flattened/shifted diurnal HR deviations — all modestly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Net effect in the participant’s study: several relatively large, positively correlated predictors of PSS are elevated, and the integrated interpretation in the description concludes above-mean perceived stress.

Protective/attenuating factors noted for Participant 1 (temper but do not eliminate risk)
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE = 38; r with PSS ≈ −0.68) and relatively low interpersonal difficulty (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ −1.27).
- Lower resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ −0.9 and −1.4), modestly protective.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Behavioral and physiological risk features (present but generally weaker/more circumscribed than Participant 1’s risk signals):
  - Very high sedentary/screen time (video games Z = 4.74, TV Z = 3.17, internet Z = 2.19), low exercise — these have only modest sample correlations with PSS but can erode stress-buffering behaviors.
  - Low social-trust score (Trust Z = −2.39), a potential interpersonal risk.
  - Late median sleep start (~01:04 AM) which can relate to social/scheduling strain.
  - Modestly elevated heart-rate mesor and amplitude (mesor Z = 1.35; amplitude Z = 1.72) and slightly elevated resting HR (62.4 bpm, Z = 0.51) — small positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
- In the participant’s study: these are noted as countervailing risks but the description emphasizes they are smaller in magnitude than protective signals.

Protective/attenuating factors noted for Participant 2 (strong)
- Very low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0; Z ≈ −1.38) and very low trait anxiety (STAI-Trait = 20; Z ≈ −2.11) — both are strong protective signals versus PSS.
- High self-esteem and elevated momentary happiness (positive affective/resilience indicators).
- Good subjective sleep (PSQI = 3; Z ≈ −1.72) and near-mean adequate sleep duration (~7 h 14 m).
- Very strong circadian regularity and low intradaily variability (interdaily stability Z = 2.4; 24-h autocorrelation Z = 2.24; intradaily variability Z = −2.29) — these are associated with lower PSS.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their study’s mean PSS (population mean 21.04), driven by several high-magnitude predictors that in this cohort have strong correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 and emotional lability). Protective factors are present but smaller relative to the risk signals.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as below their study’s mean PSS (population mean 21.64), with multiple strong protective signals (very low depression and trait anxiety, good sleep and circadian regularity) outweighing the behavioral/physiological risk signs, which are described as smaller in magnitude.
- The two population means are similar (21.04 vs 21.64), so cross-study mean differences do not materially complicate the comparison. The decisive factor is that Participant 1 shows several large, highly PSS-correlated elevations, whereas Participant 2 shows strong protective indicators with only modest risk factors.

Overall judgment
Given the relative strength and number of PSS-related risk indicators in Participant 1 (especially the highly PSS-correlated anxiety, emotional lability, severe subjective sleep disturbance, and pain) versus the dominant protective profile in Participant 2, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

20,24029,21,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10), which in this cohort has a very large positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77). This is a major risk signal for above-mean PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5), with a substantial positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- High pain intensity/interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86), measures that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.45–0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9) with a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.66).
- Wearable circadian/sleep signals consistent with stress risk: very short median recorded sleep (~3 h 55 min), reduced HR amplitude and low interdaily stability (modest correlations with higher PSS), and a flattened/shifted diurnal HR profile.
- Although there are protective factors (high general self-efficacy, low interpersonal difficulty, low resting HR), many of the strongest predictors of PSS in this sample are elevated for this participant, so the net evidence favors above-mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 21; Z ≈ 0.8) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z ≈ 0.86), both positively correlated with PSS in this sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Marginal subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and non-trivial sleep timing variability / somewhat short median sleep (6 h 46 min), which tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability, Z ≈ 1.09) and reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation—both of which are associated with higher PSS (though correlations are modest, r ≈ 0.15).
- Low self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29), which modestly predicts higher PSS.
- However, several protective/mitigating factors are prominent: frequent exercise, no substance use, relatively low resting HR, and modestly higher self-reported happiness—factors expected to reduce PSS or buffer stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study population frame
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population means. Important for comparison is the strength and predictive value of the elevated features in each description relative to their cohort correlations.
- Participant 1’s elevated indicators include multiple measures that have large sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77 and emotional lability r ≈ 0.66, plus substantial sleep and pain correlations). The symptom elevations are also clinically meaningful (e.g., GAD-7 at screening threshold, very high PSQI, marked pain interference).
- Participant 2’s risk indicators are consistent but generally less strongly linked to PSS in the sample (CES‑D, STAI correlations ~0.28–0.31; circadian indices with small correlations ~0.15). Moreover, Participant 2 shows several robust behavioral/physiological protective factors (frequent exercise, no substance use, low resting HR, higher happiness) that are likely to attenuate perceived stress.
- In short, Participant 1 shows a cluster of high-impact predictors (large-correlated self-report symptoms plus very short sleep and circadian blunting) that outweigh their protective signals; Participant 2 shows moderate-risk signals that are offset to a greater extent by protective behaviors.

Overall judgment
- Given the magnitude of the symptom elevations in Participant 1 and the much stronger sample-level correlations of those features with PSS, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (0.28, Z = −1.07), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = −0.87), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74). These features in this sample modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Blunted diurnal heart‑rate rhythm (amplitude Z = −1.03), which can reflect reduced day–night differentiation and is modestly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Early-morning heart‑rate deviations (pronounced morning peak Z = 3.07 at 6–7am) that correlate modestly with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23), possibly indicating morning arousal related to stressors or schedule demands.
- Note: the summary explicitly states these signals are smaller in magnitude and do not override strong protective self-report signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Strong self-report correlates of PSS are elevated: GAD-7 = 8 (mild anxiety) where anxiety has the largest correlation with PSS in the dataset (r = 0.77).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) with PSQI–PSS correlation r = 0.49.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 0.63; r = 0.66) and pain/interference (PEG-3; r ≈ 0.44–0.48) — both meaningfully associated with higher PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.44) with a strong negative correlation with PSS (r = −0.65), reducing coping reserve.
- Wearable physiology consistent with hyperarousal: elevated resting HR (76.35 bpm, Z = 1.19) and MESOR (Z = 1.24).
- Circadian dysregulation: reduced amplitude (Z = −1.05), low interdaily stability (Z = −0.46), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.07) — overall a blunted, fragmented rhythm associated with higher stress.
- Nocturnal/early-morning HR elevations (1–8 AM hours with several Z > 1; correlations with PSS r ≈ 0.38–0.41), suggesting incomplete downregulation.
- Extremely short median nightly sleep by wearable (1 h 39 m, Z = −1.27) and very late median sleep start (~04:36 AM), plus naps (mean daily naps 0.4, Z = 1.24) — objective patterns that align with nocturnal hyperarousal and higher perceived stress.
- Mitigating notes: GAD-7 is only mild, substance‑abuse scale is low, and some wearable–PSS correlations are inconsistent, but overall multiple strong, independent lines point toward higher PSS.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study population mean (Participant 1 mean PSS = 21.65; Participant 2 mean PSS = 21.08). Participant 1’s self-report measures (STAI Z = −1.71; CES‑D Z = −1.07; high happiness and self‑esteem) are robustly protective and directly related to lower perceived stress; the wearable signals suggesting stress are smaller in effect and explicitly described as not fully overriding the self-report profile. Thus Participant 1 is inferred to be below their population mean.
- Participant 2 presents multiple high‑correlation predictors of PSS (notably anxiety r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, low self‑efficacy r = −0.65, PSQI r = 0.49) alongside objective physiological markers of hyperarousal and severe sleep timing/quantity problems. These are numerous, mutually consistent, and described as indicating above‑mean perceived stress in that sample.
- Weighting the evidence: Participant 1’s strongest signals are protective self-reports and good sleep quantity/quality; Participant 2 has several strong risk indicators with high correlations to PSS and concordant wearable signs. The magnitude, number, and correlation strength of Participant 2’s risk indicators outweigh the relatively modest wearable concerns for Participant 1.

8,97596,20,32,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 33, Z = 2.05), which in the sample are positively associated with PSS.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83), a strong subjective correlate of perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.56) and low current happiness (Z = -1.61), both consistent with higher stress reporting.
- Physiological signs of greater arousal / rhythm fragmentation: resting HR mildly elevated (Z = 0.65) and intradaily variability elevated (IV Z = 0.81).
- Low-to-moderate self‑esteem (RSES Z = -0.31) aligning with higher stress profiles.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not extremely high) PSS
- Objective sleep duration is longer than average (median ~8 h 10 min, Z = 1.22) and relatively consistent night‑to‑night (sleep SD Z = -0.92), which are potential protective factors.
- Regular exercise (Z = 1.07), moderate social time (Z = 0.95), minimal substance use, and high music engagement (Z = 2.06) could buffer perceived stress.
- Many of the strongest sample-level correlates with PSS are weaker for this participant (e.g., CES‑D/STAI correlations with PSS reported as modest r ≈ 0.27–0.31).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 8) with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.77), making this a powerful predictor of above‑mean PSS.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13; r with PSS = 0.49) and objective sleep pattern consistent with severe sleep restriction/late timing (median nightly sleep ≈ 1 h 39 min, very late sleep start ~04:36 AM; Zs indicate notable deviations), which align with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 0.63; r with PSS = 0.66) and pain/interference (PEG r ≈ 0.44), both correlating substantially with PSS.
- Physiological/circadian markers of hyperarousal and dysregulation: resting HR and MESOR markedly elevated (Z ≈ 1.19–1.24), reduced amplitude (Z = -1.05), low interdaily stability (Z = -0.46), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.07), and pronounced early‑morning HR elevations that correlate with PSS.
- Multiple high‑correlation predictors (anxiety, emotional lability, self‑efficacy, PSQI) converge to suggest above‑mean PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or uncertain) PSS
- GAD‑7 is only in the mild range rather than moderate/severe.
- Some wearable‑to‑PSS correlations are inconsistent or weak in the sample; objective sleep metric may be affected by device non‑wear or artifact (noted caveat).
- Low substance‑abuse scores and moderate self‑efficacy (not extremely low) are modest mitigating factors.

Comparative, within‑study-frame reasoning and weighing the evidence
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective study means. The question is which is likely more elevated relative to their own peers.
- Participant 1’s strongest deviations are high depressive symptoms and very high subjective sleep disturbance; however, in this study those measures showed only modest sample correlations with PSS (CES‑D/STAI r ≈ 0.27–0.31; PSQI correlation not quantified as very large). Importantly, Participant 1 also shows several meaningful protective factors (long, consistent objective sleep; regular exercise; social engagement; minimal substance use) that temper the inference of very high PSS.
- Participant 2’s profile contains multiple measures that both deviate from the sample mean and have large sample correlations with PSS (notably anxiety r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, self‑efficacy r = -0.65, PSQI r = 0.49). Physiological markers (resting HR/MESOR Z ≈ 1.2, reduced amplitude, high IV, nocturnal HR elevations) further corroborate hyperarousal and circadian dysregulation. Even allowing for the caveat that some objective sleep metrics may be artifact-prone, the convergence of several high‑weight predictors with objective physiological dysregulation makes a stronger case that Participant 2’s perceived stress is relatively higher versus their population.
- In sum, Participant 2’s deviations are both more numerous among the measures that have the strongest sample‑level associations with PSS and show clearer physiological corroboration of hyperarousal. Participant 1 shows significant distress (notably depression and subjective sleep problems) but also stronger behavioral/physiological protective signs and weaker-to-moderate PSS‑correlation weights on key measures.

Final determination

7,28327,15,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong elevations on affective clinical scales: CES-D = 33 (z ≈ +2.05, classified as depressed) and STAI–Trait = 58 (z ≈ +1.65, classified as anxious). Both scales are positively correlated with PSS in this sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31) and represent large, clinically meaningful deviations from the study mean.
- Low self-regard and positive affect: Rosenberg self‑esteem (z ≈ −1.71) and happiness (z ≈ −1.61) are substantially below the sample mean; both are negatively correlated with PSS in the dataset and indicate reduced psychological resilience.
- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05, disturbed sleep) — subjective sleep disturbance in combination with depressive/anxious symptoms tends to align with higher perceived stress.
- Physiological markers of within-day arousal and fragmentation: elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.02) and pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (hourly deviations with z up to ≈ +2.24) are associated with stress-related arousal/irregularity.
- Integrated picture: multiple converging self-report indicators (depression, trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, low happiness, poor subjective sleep) together with physiological signs of evening activation point toward perceived stress above the sample mean. Objective nocturnal physiology is partly preserved (mitigating) but does not override the strong affective signal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15.5 (z ≈ +0.67, disturbed sleep) and very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) with large night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD z ≈ +0.89). PSQI correlates fairly strongly with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.53), and extreme short/irregular sleep is a common correlate of elevated perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 Interpersonal subscale quite elevated (z ≈ +2.34), indicating notable social/interpersonal stressors that plausibly raise perceived stress (though this subscale has only a weak correlation with PSS in the sample).
- Circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ −1.05), reduced cosinor amplitude (z ≈ −0.84), and high sleep timing variability point toward weakened daily structure, a pattern often seen with higher stress or poor coping.
- But there are substantial counter-indicators: very low concurrent anxiety (GAD‑7 z ≈ −1.38), low pain and emotional lability (z ≈ −1.29 and −1.27), near‑average self‑efficacy (z ≈ −0.07, and self‑efficacy correlates strongly with lower PSS in the sample r ≈ −0.66), and lower resting HR/MESOR — all of which argue against very high perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Breadth and clinical salience: Participant 1 shows multiple large, concordant elevations on established affective symptom measures (depression, trait anxiety) and negative self‑appraisal metrics (self‑esteem, happiness) that are directly and consistently associated with higher PSS in this sample. These are strong, multi-domain psychological signals.
- Participant 2’s strongest signals relate to extremely short and irregular sleep and interpersonal problems. While sleep disruption is strongly associated with PSS in this dataset (PSQI r ≈ 0.53), several key affective distress indicators (anxiety, pain, emotional lability) are low for Participant 2, and self‑efficacy is at least average (a protective factor strongly linked to lower PSS).
- Magnitude and coherence: Participant 1’s elevations on multiple correlated psychological predictors and the presence of physiological signs of evening arousal create a coherent profile pointing above the population mean. Participant 2 has an important and concerning sleep/circadian profile that plausibly elevates stress, but that signal is partially offset by low anxiety, low pain, and average self‑efficacy; the overall interpretation given in the description placed Participant 2 near the population mean with only a modest tilt above it.
- Population context: Participant 1’s affective elevations are large relative to their study’s variability and were explicitly interpreted as “above the mean.” Participant 2’s SD for PSS is larger and the narrative concludes “near the sample mean, with a modest tilt toward being above the mean.” Thus, within their respective study frames, Participant 1 presents stronger evidence of being above-average in perceived stress than Participant 2 does.

Final determination
Based on the balance of evidence (strong, multi-domain affective distress and corroborative physiological markers for Participant 1 versus a dominant sleep/circadian disturbance but several protective signs for Participant 2), Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher PSS.

Although Participant 1 shows some circadian irregularity that correlates modestly with higher PSS, those effects are smaller and described as only modest-to-small associations.
- Participant 2 displays several direct self-report predictors that, in this dataset, have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (GAD‑7, emotional lability, self-efficacy, PSQI). Multiple physiological/behavioral indicators also align with higher stress (resting HR, MESOR, sleep variability). While there are some resilience signals (median sleep duration, consolidated daily rhythm), the primary and most highly correlated predictors point toward above-mean PSS.

Weighting of evidence
- Participant 1: dominant, strong protective self-report signals and healthy behaviors outweigh modest wearable circadian signals that weakly favor higher PSS. Net inference: below mean.
- Participant 2: several strong, directly relevant self-report predictors of higher PSS (with high sample-level correlations), supported by some physiological indicators of elevated arousal and disrupted sleep. Net inference: above mean.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of within-sample evidence and the relative strengths of predictors, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

  - Large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD z ≈ +1.12).

- Mitigating features are present (typical median sleep duration, consolidated circadian rhythm measures), but the strongest predictors in this dataset are the self-report measures that point above the population mean (21.08).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Wearable/behavioral circadian markers that, in this sample, modestly associate with higher PSS:
  - Reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.9) and blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -1.52; amplitude correlates r ≈ -0.16 with PSS).
  - Slightly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.32).
  - Shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 7 min; z ≈ -1.33) and higher sleep variability (z ≈ +0.94) — both have small positive correlations with PSS.
  - High sedentary/leisure time (TV z ≈ +2.54), weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Physiological anomaly: large early-morning HR deviations (very atypical) — uncertain relation to stress but could reflect early awakenings or activity that might link to poorer sleep/greater stress in some contexts.
- However, these objective indicators have smaller sample-level correlations with PSS than the key self-report predictors.

Comparative reasoning in the within-population frame
- Each description is already framed relative to its own population mean (P1 mean = 21.08; P2 mean = 21.59).
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as likely above their study mean, primarily because multiple self-report measures that strongly predict PSS in that sample are elevated (anxiety, PSQI, emotional lability, low self-efficacy). The self-report predictors for P1 have relatively large sample-level correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; BASIS-24 r ≈ 0.67; NGSE r ≈ -0.66), so their deviations carry substantial weight.
- Participant 2 is characterized as likely below their study mean, driven by strong favorable self-report scores (low trait anxiety, high happiness/health satisfaction, high self-esteem) that also correlate with PSS (though with smaller r’s than some P1 predictors). The objective circadian/sleep signals for P2 point toward some risk but are weaker predictors of PSS in that sample (smaller r values).
- Weighting evidence: P1’s elevation is supported by multiple strong self-report predictors (highly correlated with PSS) plus some physiological corroboration. P2’s potential elevation rests mainly on weaker wearable indicators while its self-report profile strongly argues for lower stress.

Overall judgment
- Given that the strongest, most directly relevant predictors of PSS in each dataset are self-report measures, and those self-report signals for Participant 1 indicate above-mean stress while Participant 2’s self-report signals indicate below-mean stress (with wearable markers for P2 being weaker predictors), Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (“Disturbed Sleep”), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42). Subjective sleep complaints can increase perceived stress even when objective duration is adequate.
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations: early-morning HR values (2–6am) show larger negative deviations from mesor that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These are modest signals that could contribute to elevated perceived stress for this individual.
- Sleep quality / objective–subjective discrepancy: Objective sleep duration is adequate but subjective quality is poor; that mismatch itself is often associated with distress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 48 (Z = +0.66), and STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.34), a clear risk signal for higher perceived stress.
- Very low health satisfaction: Z = −2.45 (large deviation), which—even if modestly correlated with PSS (r ≈ −0.12)—is a substantial negative indicator and commonly co-occurs with greater stress.
- Short and variable sleep: median 5 h 50 min (Z = −1.68) and high sleep variability (SD = 123 min; Z ≈ +0.51). Short/irregular sleep is robustly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Lifestyle/social factors: minimal exercise (Z ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), and low happiness (Z ≈ −0.53) — all factors that commonly amplify perceived stress.
- Synthesis from the summary: the study summary explicitly infers the participant’s perceived stress is modestly above the population mean (population mean PSS = 21.67).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each participant’s description is anchored to their own study population mean. Participant 1 is characterized by multiple strong protective signals relative to her sample (maximal NGSE Z = +1.79, very low GAD-7 Z = −1.38, very low resting HR Z = −2.23, high circadian stability Zs ≈ +1.4–+1.9). These features are strongly and consistently associated with lower PSS in that dataset (notably NGSE–PSS r = −0.60 and GAD–PSS r = +0.75). The summary explicitly places Participant 1 below her population mean (21.5).
- Participant 2 shows a cluster of risk signals relative to her sample (trait anxiety above mean, very low health satisfaction, short/variable sleep, low exercise/social behavior). The study summary explicitly places Participant 2 modestly above her population mean (21.67). Although Participant 2 has some protective markers (good subjective sleep quality, low resting HR, stable circadian metrics), the balance of risk vs. protection in her profile was judged by the study team to indicate above-mean perceived stress.
- Because both descriptions are relative to their respective population means and Participant 1 is explicitly described as below her mean while Participant 2 is described as above hers, the within-population evidence points toward Participant 2 having the higher PSS.

Overall judgment
- Weighing the strength and number of signals: Participant 1’s profile contains several strong, highly predictive protective indicators (very high self-efficacy, very low anxiety, very low RHR, strong circadian regularity) and only a single notable risk (subjective sleep disturbance, relatively modest correlations). Participant 2’s profile contains multiple substantive risk indicators (elevated trait anxiety, very low health satisfaction, short/irregular sleep, low exercise/social engagement) that the study authors interpret as producing a modestly above-mean PSS. Thus Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Elevated depressive and trait‑anxiety symptoms vs. sample mean: CES‑D = 19 (Z = 0.59; CES‑D–PSS r ≈ 0.28) and STAI‑Trait = 43 (Z = 0.17; STAI–PSS r ≈ 0.31). These symptom measures are positively and directly associated with PSS and point toward higher perceived stress.
- Lower well‑being/self‑esteem: RSES Z = −0.45, lower happiness and health satisfaction (Z ≈ −0.53 and −0.95), which in this sample are associated modestly with higher PSS.
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone: RHR = 65.1 bpm (Z = 0.83) and mesor Z = 1.32; RHR has a (small) positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), indicating greater tonic arousal associated with stress.
- Sleep timing/quantity patterns often linked to stress: late median sleep onset (01:39), shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 32 min; Z = −0.81), and elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps Z = 2.66) — these can reflect insufficient/shifted sleep that associates with higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s population frame
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as below the cohort mean PSS (population mean 21.5). The strongest, highly correlated indicators (very high self‑efficacy NGSE Z = +1.79; very low GAD‑7 Z = −1.38; low RHR Z = −2.23; strong circadian stability Zs up to ≈ +1.89) point strongly toward lower perceived stress. The countervailing signals (PSQI and some nocturnal HR features) are weaker in magnitude and/or have smaller correlations with PSS than the protective indicators.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the cohort mean PSS (population mean 21.62) but with a slight tendency toward higher stress. Several modestly elevated self‑report symptom measures that directly correlate with PSS (CES‑D, STAI) and elevated resting cardiovascular tone favor higher perceived stress. However, Participant 2 also has meaningful protective factors (good PSQI, high interdaily stability/autocorrelation, low intradaily variability, low substance use, good academic performance) that moderate risk and help explain the “near mean” conclusion.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: dominant, strongly weighted protective signals (large Z deviations and measures with strong correlations to PSS) and only isolated, weaker stress signals → overall likely below population mean.
- Participant 2: a mix of modestly elevated symptom scores and physiological signs of higher baseline arousal, balanced but not fully offset by protective circadian/behavioral factors → overall near the population mean with a modest tilt toward higher stress.

Conclusion (which participant likely has the higher PSS)
- Participant 2 shows more and clearer indications of being at-or-above their study population’s mean PSS than Participant 1 does relative to theirs. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

21,64296,30,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample):
- Elevated trait anxiety (GAD-7 = 12) — high correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), clinically meaningful score.  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; z = 1.32) — positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).  
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: several overnight hourly heart-rate deviations above sample mean (e.g., midnight–2am z ≈ 0.7–1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39), suggesting impaired nocturnal recovery.  
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24) strongly associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.68).  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z = −0.25) and elevated substance-use subscale (z ≈ 1.5) are additional stress‑relevant signals.  
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is above the study mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample) — i.e., signals that could raise PSS relative to their sample:
- Shorter-than-average median sleep (6 h 52 min, z ≈ −0.4) and late habitual sleep onset (~1:07 AM) — modest risk factors that can be associated with higher stress in some contexts.  
- Low reported solo exercise and minimal social time (small-to-moderate negative z’s) — behavioral limits on stress buffers.  
- These indicators are modest in magnitude and the summary characterizes them as cautionary rather than strongly predictive; overall the profile was judged below the sample mean.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning:
- Each description is already framed relative to its own study population. Participant 1’s profile is explicitly interpreted as above their population mean PSS; Participant 2’s profile is explicitly interpreted as below their population mean PSS.  
- The most diagnostic differences are in the strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1 has multiple moderately-to-strongly correlated psychological predictors of PSS (notably GAD-7 r≈0.77 and emotional lability r≈0.68) plus objective nocturnal HR elevations and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI z=1.32). These are high-impact, convergent indicators pointing toward elevated perceived stress relative to their peers.  
- Participant 2 shows several strong protective signals relative to their peers (very low depressive symptoms z ≈ −1.07, low trait anxiety z ≈ −0.62, high self‑esteem and happiness, very large HR amplitude z ≈ 2.7, high interdaily stability and autocorrelation). The few risk signs (slightly short/late sleep, low exercise/social time) are smaller in magnitude and characterized as weakly correlated with PSS in that sample.

Weighing the balance of evidence, the convergent, high‑impact psychological and nocturnal physiological indicators for Participant 1 outweigh the modest behavioral risks for Participant 2. Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (relative to their study population).

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 29, Z = 1.63) and mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.46), both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and very irregular/delayed sleep timing (median sleep onset ≈ 03:45 AM; high night‑to‑night variability SD = 173 min, Z = 1.65), which correlate with higher PSS.
- Circadian irregularity (low 24‑h autocorrelation, Z = -1.12; lower interdaily stability), consistent with stress-related dysregulation.
- Pronounced late‑afternoon/evening HR surge (5–6 pm deviation Z = 2.76) that may reflect episodes of physiological arousal linked to stress.

Mitigating/protective factors for Participant 1
- Minimal substance use, relatively low resting HR and lower MESOR (Z scores negative), frequent group exercise, and modestly higher happiness/health satisfaction—factors associated with lower perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high clinical anxiety (GAD‑7 = 21, Z = 2.04) — a strong correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = 1.49) and extremely short median sleep duration (3 h 42 m) with high night‑to‑night variability; objective sleep/circadian disruption corroborates self‑report.
- Marked pain and interference (PEG‑3/PAPAS Z = 2.28) and high emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z = 2.42), both of which commonly accompany and amplify perceived stress.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -2.29), indicating reduced coping resources and likely higher perceived stress.
- Hourly heart‑rate deviations at night that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), consistent with nocturnal arousal/insomnia and elevated stress.

Mitigating/protective factors for Participant 2
- Minimal substance‑use problems (BASIS‑24 Substance Abuse Z = -1.62), relatively preserved interpersonal functioning (Z = -1.07), and low resting HR (≈55 bpm, Z ≈ -0.93), which may buffer some stress effects.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population mean PSS, but the strength and breadth of stress‑related indicators differ. Participant 1 shows moderate elevations primarily in depressive symptoms and sleep/circadian irregularity, with several notable protective features that temper the inference. Participant 2 shows multiple, large‑magnitude risk indicators (severe anxiety, extremely short and fragmented sleep, high pain/interference, high emotional lability, very low self‑efficacy), several with high Z scores (≈2 or greater) and strong associations with PSS (notably GAD‑7). The severity and convergence of indicators in Participant 2 are both quantitatively larger and qualitatively more pervasive than in Participant 1.
- Taking into account that each profile is interpreted relative to its own study mean (PSS means: Participant 1’s population = 21.6; Participant 2’s population = 20.33), Participant 2’s combination of severe anxiety and extreme sleep restriction (plus large Zs on pain and emotional lability and low self‑efficacy) points to a higher relative perceived stress level than Participant 1’s more mixed profile.

4,44869,31,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong psychological drivers with large effect sizes:
  - Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51). Anxiety in this sample is one of the strongest correlates of PSS (r ≈ 0.75).  
  - Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61).  
- Substantive symptom burden likely to increase perceived stress:
  - Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83).  
  - High pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6).  
- Physiological corroboration of stress-related arousal:
  - Large nocturnal heart-rate deviations during late-night hours (several HR deviations with high Zs) and late sleep timing/short sleep duration consistent with hyperarousal; some nocturnal windows show positive correlations with PSS.
- Mitigating factors (limit but do not negate risk):
  - Relatively preserved circadian amplitude and interdaily stability (Zs positive), low intradaily fragmentation, near-average resting HR, low substance use. These may buffer stress but are smaller in predictive weight than the psychological/physiological risk signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Multiple converging risk signals across domains:
  - Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 22; Z ≈ 0.9) that correlate positively with PSS.  
  - Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ 1.52) despite long median sleep.  
  - Elevated resting heart rate and MESOR (resting HR Z ≈ 2.41; MESOR Z ≈ 1.97) indicating a higher physiological baseline.  
  - Increased circadian fragmentation and instability (intradaily variability Z ≈ 1.16; sleep duration SD Z ≈ 2.09; sleep start SD Z ≈ 1.63).  
  - Very high sedentary hobby time (Z ≈ 3.19) and low exercise frequency, plus somewhat reduced current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53).
- Mitigating/protective factors:
  - Trait anxiety not elevated (STAI-Trait Z ≈ -0.23).  
  - High self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ 0.26), minimal substance use, higher health satisfaction, and long median sleep duration (Z ≈ 1.55).  
- Note on strength of signals: several of Participant 2’s objective signals (resting HR, sleep variability, intradaily variability) are elevated but generally show smaller correlations with PSS in the sample (small-to-moderate r values), so they corroborate but are individually weaker predictors than some of Participant 1’s top measures.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population PSS means. The task is to judge which is likely worse relative to their own cohort.
- Participant 1’s elevated-stress indicators center on severe clinical anxiety and low self-efficacy—variables that, in this sample, have large correlations with PSS (notably r ≈ 0.75 for anxiety and r ≈ -0.61 for self-efficacy). Those psychological measures have strong predictive value for perceived stress and are supported by concordant subjective sleep problems, pain interference, and nocturnal physiological arousal.
- Participant 2 shows multiple elevated indicators (depression, poor PSQI, high resting HR/MESOR, circadian fragmentation, sleep variability), but many of these metrics have smaller associations with PSS in the sample (small-to-moderate r values). Participant 2 also has several protective psychosocial factors (high self-esteem, normal trait anxiety, low substance use) that likely attenuate perceived stress relative to the risk signals.
- Effect-size weighting: Participant 1’s top risk features are both larger in z-score magnitude (e.g., NGSE Z ≈ -1.73) and more strongly correlated with PSS than most of Participant 2’s signals. Although Participant 2 has marked physiological elevations (resting HR Z ≈ 2.41) and behavioral instability, these are, in this dataset, weaker individual predictors of PSS than clinical anxiety and low self-efficacy.

Weighed conclusion
- Considering the relative strengths of the psychological predictors, z-scores, and concordant physiological evidence, Participant 1’s profile is more strongly indicative of higher perceived stress (relative to their population mean) than Participant 2’s profile is relative to theirs.

- Strong anxiety symptom signal tightly linked to PSS: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = +0.90) and r(PSS,GAD7) = 0.80 in this sample → large sample-level predictor of higher PSS.  
- Severe objective sleep disruption: extremely short median nightly sleep (2 h 19 m; Z = −1.04), very late/variable sleep onset (median ~02:49 AM; start-time SD Z = +1.16) and very disturbed PSQI (13). Sleep features that are highly plausibly tied to increased perceived stress.  
- Marked physiological/arousal abnormalities: elevated resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = +1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = −1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = −1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z = +1.23) — a pattern consistent with chronic dysregulation and higher stress.  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (+8–9 bpm around midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42), indicating nighttime physiological arousal linked to perceived stress.  
- Pain/interference elevated and moderately correlated with PSS (PEG-3 Z = +0.44; pain-related burden r ≈ 0.47), adding to the stress load.  
- Protective factor present but modest: self-efficacy slightly above mean (Z = +0.12) but unlikely to offset the strong anxiety/sleep/arousal signals.

- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI-trait = 52 (Z = +1.06, r with PSS ≈ 0.31) and CES-D = 17 (Z = +0.38, r ≈ 0.28) — both support higher perceived stress.  
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05) and objectively late/short sleep (median ~02:25 AM; sleep ~5 h 58 m, Z = −1.52) consistent with reduced recovery and higher stress.  
- Circadian fragmentation and physiological activation: intradaily variability (Z = +0.46) and reduced 24-hr autocorrelation (Z = −0.19) — both associated with higher PSS in the sample; notable evening heart-rate deviations (large positive deviation 5–6 pm, Z ≈ +1.69) suggesting daytime/evening arousal.  
- However, several moderate-to-strong protective factors that could attenuate perceived stress: frequent exercise (Z = +1.07), high self-rated physical health (Z = +1.30), high interpersonal trust (Z = +1.79), low substance use and moderate social contact.

Comparative within-population reasoning
- Magnitude and convergence of signals: Participant 1 shows more extreme objective physiological dysregulation (high resting HR Z = +1.67, very low circadian amplitude Z = −1.57, low interdaily stability Z = −1.34) and dramatically short objective sleep (median ~2 h) that converges with very elevated PSQI and strong anxiety. Participant 2 has elevated anxiety/depression and short/late sleep but physiological markers are less extreme (resting HR Z = +0.47; fragmentation moderate).  
- Strength of sample-level predictors: For Participant 1 the key symptom measure (GAD-7) has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.80), amplifying the implication of that elevated anxiety score for PSS. For Participant 2, STAI and CES-D are correlated with PSS but with more modest effect sizes (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28).  
- Protective factors: Participant 2 has multiple substantial behavioral/social protective factors (exercise, health satisfaction, interpersonal trust) that plausibly reduce perceived stress, whereas Participant 1’s main protective indicator (self-efficacy) is small.  
- Overall severity: Participant 1’s combination of extreme sleep deprivation, nocturnal physiological arousal, elevated resting HR, and a highly PSS-linked anxiety signal represent a more severe and convergent stress profile relative to their cohort mean than Participant 2’s profile relative to their cohort mean.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; Z = -1.13). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r = 0.46), so poor sleep quality is a plausible contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Very short wearable-measured nocturnal sleep (median 3 h 27 min; Z = -0.66) and high night-to-night variability (SD = 197 min; Z = 0.62). Short/irregular sleep often co-occurs with greater perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily variability in circadian/rest-activity rhythm (value = 0.64; Z = 2.29). In the sample this metric trends with higher PSS (r = 0.24), indicating fragmented daily rhythms that can increase stress vulnerability.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 0.94) that could be an added psychosocial stressor (note: in this sample that subscale shows a very small/uncertain relation to PSS).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 48; Z = +0.66). STAI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.34), making it a meaningful risk signal for higher perceived stress.
- Very low subjective health satisfaction (Z = −2.45). Although its correlation with PSS is small, the large departure from the sample mean is notable and commonly aligns with increased perceived stress.
- Short objective sleep (median ~5 h 50 min; Z = −1.68) and elevated sleep variability (SD Z = +0.51), both of which are frequently associated with greater perceived stress.
- Behavioral/lifestyle risk signals: minimal exercise (Zs ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), and low happiness (Z ≈ −0.53), all of which can amplify perceived stress.

Comparative, within-sample considerations
- Each description is relative to its own study’s mean. Participant 1’s summary explicitly leans toward PSS below that study’s mean (mean = 21.42, SD = 7.28), whereas Participant 2’s summary leans toward PSS modestly above that study’s mean (mean = 21.67, SD = 3.51).
- Strength of predictors: For Participant 1 the strongest sample-level predictors point toward lower stress (very low GAD-7, strong inverse NGSE, very low emotional lability). GAD-7 and NGSE have large correlations with PSS in Participant 1’s sample (r = 0.76 and r = -0.65 respectively), so these are powerful indicators that this person is likely below their study mean despite sleep pathology.
- For Participant 2 the elevated-risk signals (STAI, very low health satisfaction, short sleep, low exercise/social/happiness) are meaningful but generally of smaller effect sizes at the sample level than the strong protective indicators seen for Participant 1. Participant 2 does have fewer very strong protective indicators (some good signs like low resting HR and stable circadian metrics, but these are not described as having as large sample-level PSS correlations as GAD-7/NGSE in Participant 1’s dataset).
- Severity of sleep problems: Participant 1’s objective sleep restriction is extreme (≈3.5 hours), which is a serious stressor; however, the sample-level strongest correlates (low anxiety, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) weigh more heavily toward lower PSS for this participant. Participant 2’s sleep is short and irregular but less extreme; combined with elevated trait anxiety and very low health satisfaction, this yields a modest above-mean PSS inference.

Overall judgment
- Considering within-sample comparator information and the relative strengths of predictors, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) overall perceived stress. Participant 1’s profile is mixed but—because of very strong protective signals that have large sample-level associations with PSS—is inferred to be below that study’s mean. Participant 2’s profile is inferred modestly above their study mean and lacks the same magnitude of strong protective indicators present for Participant 1.

- Severe objective sleep restriction: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 27 min (very short relative to the sample), and elevated nap frequency — objective sleep quantity is a salient stress-related signal in this profile.
- High intradaily variability (IV = 0.64, Z = 2.29); IV has a positive relationship with PSS (r ≈ 0.24) and indicates fragmented/rest–activity organization that trends toward higher stress.
- Some interpersonal strain: elevated BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale (Z ≈ 0.94), which could contribute to perceived stress (even if its correlation with PSS is small in the sample).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6, above the usual clinical cutoff; PSQI → PSS association is modest but relevant.
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV z ≈ 0.67) and late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:31 AM) — both have small positive associations with PSS in this cohort.
- Behavioral correlates that sometimes co-occur with stress (more sedentary/leisure time, weekly beer use), though correlations with PSS are small.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both descriptions conclude the participants are likely at-or-below their study sample means, but the strengths and directions of the signals differ.
- Participant 1: the strongest stress-related signals are severe objective and subjective sleep problems and very high intradaily variability. However, Participant 1 also has very strong protective indicators against perceived stress in this sample (notably very low GAD-7 and high general self-efficacy, both of which have large sample-level correlations with PSS and point toward lower PSS). The net inference in the description was “below mean,” but the presence of extreme sleep restriction and high IV are substantial risk signals that could push perceived stress upward.
- Participant 2: multiple consistent indicators point toward lower perceived stress (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, long and regular objective sleep, low resting HR, strong circadian amplitude, regular social exercise). The adverse indicators for Participant 2 (PSQI = 6, late timing, modest IV) are generally smaller in magnitude and have weaker correlations with PSS in the sample than the protective signals are.
- Weighing magnitudes and consistency: Participant 2’s profile contains more numerous and consistent indicators that predict lower PSS in this cohort. Participant 1’s profile is more mixed — although some of the strongest sample-level predictors (low anxiety, high self‑efficacy) point to lower PSS, the extreme objective sleep restriction and pronounced IV are unusually strong risk signals relative to Participant 2’s modest adverse signs.

Overall judgment
- Participant 1 shows larger, more severe sleep- and rhythm-related risk signals that are plausibly associated with higher perceived stress, whereas Participant 2 shows a clearer pattern of protective indicators and only modest stress-related signals.
- Therefore, Participant 1 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress), relative to their respective study samples.

- Substance-related problems and pain interference: Substance Abuse subscale Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — both plausibly increase perceived stress.
- Circadian instability / flattened rhythms: low interdaily stability (Z = -1.42), low amplitude (Z = -1.10), low 24-h autocorrelation (Z = -0.68); these rhythm disturbances modestly correlate with higher PSS.
- Weaker counterevidence: although very high self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79) and lower resting HR (Z = -0.55) are protective, many of the strongest PSS-correlated signals point toward elevated stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population)
- Elevated trait anxiety and subjective sleep problems: STAI = 48 (Z ≈ 0.66) and PSQI = 9 (Z = 1.05); both self-report signals positively associated with PSS in this sample (trait anxiety r ≈ 0.31, PSQI positively correlated).
- Some behavioral risks: low exercise frequency and modest self-esteem (RSES Z = -0.45) that, in population analyses, modestly co-occur with higher stress.
- Weaker counterevidence: objective physiology strongly favors lower stress — robust circadian amplitude (Z = 1.54), high mesor (Z = 1.30), strong 24-h autocorrelation (Z = 0.90), good median sleep duration (7 h 35 m, Z = 0.51), low sleep timing variability (Z = -0.54), and pronounced nocturnal HR decline — features that in this sample are modestly negatively correlated with PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Both descriptions infer PSS above their respective population means. However, the strength and extremity of stress-related indicators differ:
  - Participant 1 shows multiple, large, and convergent signals tied to higher PSS: objectively extreme sleep deprivation and irregularity (very large effect sizes and strong correlations with PSS), strong associations between anxiety/emotional lability and PSS in this sample (high correlation coefficients), and elevated substance-related problems. Several of these indicators (especially the extreme objective sleep deficit and high substance-score Z) are extreme relative to sample norms.
  - Participant 2 shows self-report indicators of elevated stress (moderate trait anxiety and worse subjective sleep) but these are smaller in magnitude (Zs ≈ 0.6–1.0) and their correlations with PSS in the sample are modest. Critically, Participant 2’s objective physiology and sleep duration are consistent with preserved circadian health and nocturnal recovery — signals that modestly predict lower PSS and therefore substantially counterbalance the self-report risk.
- Weighting by magnitude and by the reported correlations with PSS in each sample: Participant 1’s largest signals (extremely short objective sleep, high sleep timing variability, and strong anxiety–PSS correlations) are both larger in effect size and tied to stronger PSS correlations than Participant 2’s primary risk signals. Participant 2’s objective protections reduce confidence that their PSS is as high as Participant 1’s.

- Participant 1 more likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +1.16), a predictor positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Objectively short sleep (median 5 h 35 min; Z ≈ −1.99) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7), both commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity (lower interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.74, elevated intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.39) and late sleep timing (≈02:08) with pronounced evening physiological activation (evening HR peak Z ≈ +1.79), suggesting trouble offloading arousal at night.
- Contextual psychosocial stressor (declining GPA) and lower self-rated health/happiness and modestly reduced self-esteem.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Very severe objective sleep restriction (median ~3 h 30 min) and highly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5); both have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.48).
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) with moderate correlations to PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (Z up to ≈ +0.67 in late-night/early-morning windows) that correlate moderately with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.43), plus reduced circadian robustness—converging physiological signals of arousal during typical sleep hours.

Comparative within-sample reasoning and weighing of evidence:
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population PSS means in their summaries, but the strength and number of PSS-relevant signals differ.
- Participant 2’s risk signals are both more extreme (very short sleep, very high PSQI) and are tied to measures that show moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS (sleep disturbance, pain, nocturnal HR). These provide multiple, converging predictors that are directly and moderately predictive of PSS in that sample.
- Participant 1 shows meaningful risk signals (short sleep, elevated trait anxiety, circadian irregularity, evening HR peak) but many of those predictors have smaller sample correlations with PSS, and several strong protective factors are present (very low resting HR/mesor indicative of fitness, frequent exercise, low substance use, normal depressive symptoms). The protective signals for Participant 1 are substantial and likely reduce net perceived stress relative to their peers.
- Participant 2 does have strong protective indicators (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability), and these are highly predictive of lower PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77). However, the extremity and multi-domain convergence of Participant 2’s sleep deprivation, pain, and nocturnal arousal appear likely to outweigh those protections in net effect within that sample frame.

Overall judgment:
- Considering magnitude of abnormalities, domains involved, and sample-level correlation strengths, Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated late‑evening heart‑rate deviation (10–11 PM z ≈ +1.22) consistent with pre‑sleep physiological arousal that can increase subjective strain.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s population frame)
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), so poor perceived sleep quality is a notable risk.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) elevated relative to median; these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal z ≈ +1.54) which can reduce perceived social support and contribute to stress in context.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5) and elevated resting heart rate/mesor (z ≈ +1.2) that may reflect increased autonomic arousal; GAD-7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77), though the participant’s GAD-7 is mild.

Comparative consideration within each study’s population frame
- Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes the balance of evidence favors perceived stress below the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.61, SD = 3.68), driven by strong self‑report protections (low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness), with wearable signals introducing uncertainty but not outweighing self‑report.
- Participant 2’s summary concludes perceived stress is near the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.38, SD = 7.34), with strong protective factors (high NGSE with strong inverse correlation to PSS, robust circadian regularity) but meaningful risk factors (PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain) that push stress risk upward toward the mean.

Balance of evidence and determination
- Both profiles include mixed signals, but Participant 1 is characterized as below-average stress relative to their population, while Participant 2 is characterized as near-average (likely at or slightly below) relative to their population.
- Considering within-population positioning, Participant 2 is closer to (or at) the mean and therefore likely has higher absolute perceived stress than Participant 1, who is described as somewhat below their population mean.

11,37218,24,14,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Study 1 mean = 20.92)
- Strong, convergent self-report risk signals: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16, z = +1.16), elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 z = +1.18) and emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = +1.23); low general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55) — all of which have substantial correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Objective sleep/circadian corroboration of severe disturbance: extremely short median sleep (≈2 h 58 m, z ≈ -0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.3), low interdaily stability and very low 24-hr autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.4), and reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.4) — pattern consistent with high chronic stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal consistent with stress: marked overnight HR elevations (hourly deviations with z up to ≈ +1.44) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40).
- Taken together these multimodal signals (severe anxiety + marked sleep loss/irregularity + nocturnal autonomic arousal + low self-efficacy) point to a PSS notably above the Study 1 mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Study 2 mean = 21.63)
- Several moderately strong self-report risk signals: elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 24, z ≈ +1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI trait z ≈ +0.76); very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10, z ≈ +1.52).
- Objective sleep/circadian indicators supportive of elevated stress: shortened median sleep (≈6 h 1 min, z ≈ -1.45), very late sleep onset (~03:56) with ~74 min variability, reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -0.63), and some late-night HR elevations — all plausibly associated with higher PSS.
- Behavioral risk factor: lack of regular exercise (large negative z for exercise frequency), which tends to co-occur with higher stress.
- However, there are meaningful protective/mitigating features (no substance use, above-average interdaily stability, good GPA, social/leisure engagement) that temper the inference of very high PSS; the study summary explicitly interprets this participant as modestly above the Study 2 mean rather than extreme.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means. But Participant 1 shows multiple large, concordant deviations on measures tightly correlated with PSS (severe clinical anxiety, low self‑efficacy, emotional lability, extreme short/late sleep, strong nocturnal HR elevations, and marked circadian irregularity). Several of those z-scores are ≈ ±1.1–1.4 and include physiological signals that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40).
- Participant 2 shows meaningful elevations (notably PSQI z ≈ +1.52 and sleep-duration z ≈ -1.45 and CES-D z ≈ +1.11) but otherwise more moderate effect sizes and a number of buffering features (no substance use, decent interdaily stability, strong academic performance, social/leisure time). The study summary characterizes P2 as “likely above the population mean but not extreme,” whereas P1 is characterized as clearly elevated with stronger multimodal corroboration.
- On balance, the breadth and severity of risk indicators (clinical anxiety + severe sleep deprivation/irregularity + nocturnal autonomic arousal + low coping resources) are greater and more internally consistent for Participant 1 than the more mixed/partially buffered profile of Participant 2.

24,23576,33,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their sample frame)
- PSQI > 5 (PSQI = 6) indicating subjectively disturbed sleep despite adequate objective sleep — subjective poor sleep correlates with PSS.
- Late median sleep start (~00:38) which can associate with evening arousal/stress in some individuals.
- Modestly elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythm and some afternoon heart-rate elevations (small positive correlations with PSS in the sample).
- The subjective/objective divergence (subjective poor sleep but objectively good sleep) could reflect distress not captured by wearables.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their sample frame)
- Very high GAD-7 (18; Z = 1.51) and GAD-7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74) — strongest single predictor available.
- Extremely elevated PSQI (18.5; Z = 1.65), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63) and elevated pain/functional interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS), both associated with higher PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44), where NGSE is negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.66), suggesting reduced coping resources.
- These subjective measures are convergent and have relatively large correlations with PSS in this cohort.

Comparative reasoning (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Participant 1: The synthesis explicitly concludes the participant is likely below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). Most indicators (low depression/anxiety, good objective sleep, frequent exercise, low substance use, stable circadian metrics) point toward lower-than-average perceived stress; the stress-consistent signals are small and inconsistent.
- Participant 2: The synthesis explicitly concludes the participant is likely above the population mean PSS (population mean = 20.54). Multiple strong subjective predictors (especially severe anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) converge to indicate above-average perceived stress, and these subjective signals are described as outweighing the objective protective circadian/HR features.

Weighting the evidence
- PSS is a self-report construct and in these summaries subjective measures (anxiety, PSQI, emotional lability, pain, self-efficacy) have the largest and most direct correlations with PSS.
- Participant 2 shows multiple large, convergent subjective risk indicators with strong sample correlations (notably GAD-7), producing a robust signal of higher perceived stress.
- Participant 1 shows largely protective subjective and objective indicators, and the few stress-related signals are modest and inconsistent.
- Although the two participants’ study population means differ slightly (21.62 vs 20.54), the within-sample contrasts are clear: P1 ≈ below mean; P2 ≈ above mean. The magnitude and consistency of P2’s subjective risk factors outweigh P1’s minor risk signals.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",23576,NetHealth,21,24,Pain,33
19,94579,28,17,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance:
  - PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0, ""disturbed sleep""); median nightly sleep = 2 h 38 m (Z = −0.94) — extreme short sleep.
  - Very late sleep timing (median start 03:12 AM) and high night-to-night onset variability (SD 281 min, Z = +1.3).
  - Sleep measures in this sample have moderate positive correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.47), so these sleep deficits are meaningful contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal:
  - Elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., +13.5 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = +1.17; +9.8 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = +1.59).
  - Overnight HR elevations correlate moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.32–0.38), consistent with increased stress-related arousal.
- Anxiety and pain-related symptoms:
  - GAD-7 = 10 (meets threshold for clinically relevant anxiety); anxiety has a very strong correlation with PSS in the study (r = 0.78), making this a highly salient contributor.
  - PAPAS pain interference modestly elevated (Z = +0.19) and correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Circadian disruption:
  - Low interdaily stability and autocorrelation, increased intradaily variability, and a late acrophase — patterns associated with greater perceived stress (though correlations are modest).
- Countervailing protections are present but smaller in magnitude:
  - Self-efficacy modestly above average (Z = +0.3; r with PSS = −0.68) and low emotional lability (Z = −0.97; r with PSS = +0.72) are protective, but they do not fully offset the very severe sleep and nocturnal-arousal signals.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Affective symptom elevations:
  - CES-D = 24 (Z = +1.11, ""Depressed""); STAI = 44 (Z = +0.27). Both correlate positively with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), supporting higher perceived stress.
- Objective sleep timing irregularity:
  - Median sleep = 6 h 38 m (Z = −0.69), very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD Z = +3.21) and sleep start-time variability (start SD Z = +1.54).
  - Late median sleep start (~02:07 AM) plus high variability — these are associated with higher PSS (though correlations are small-to-moderate, e.g., r ≈ 0.17–0.18).
- Subjective reductions in wellbeing:
  - Lower current happiness and slightly low self-esteem trend with the depressive/anxiety pattern and bolster inference of elevated stress.
- Protective and stress-buffering factors are substantial:
  - Frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.1 to +1.6), frequent socializing and recreational engagement (reading Z = +4.24, social Z ≈ +0.95), very low substance use — these behaviors are associated with lower PSS (weak/negative correlations in dataset).
  - Relatively preserved circadian structure (interdaily stability Z = +0.67, autocorrelation Z = +0.48), distinct daytime HR amplitude (acrophase ~4:17 PM, amplitude Z = +0.39), and low resting HR — all consistent with resilience and oppose very large PSS elevation.
- Mixed signals:
  - Subjective sleep quality is relatively good (PSQI = 5.0, Z = −0.8) despite objective irregularity; correlations between PSS and the objective circadian/HR features are generally smaller than the large anxiety–PSS correlation seen in Participant 1.

Comparative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Strength and severity of stress-linked signals:
  - Participant 1 shows extreme, objective physiological/sleep dysregulation (very short median sleep, large nocturnal HR elevations) coupled with clinically relevant anxiety and moderately elevated pain; several of these features have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that study (notably anxiety r = 0.78 and PSQI r = 0.47). The magnitude of these stress-linked signals (especially the extremely short sleep and nocturnal arousal) is large.
  - Participant 2 shows moderate-to-moderate–large affective symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ +1.11) and very high sleep variability, but many of the objective physiological/circadian measures are preserved and several strong protective lifestyle factors are present (exercise, social activity, low substance use). The correlations linking Participant 2’s key risk features to PSS are generally smaller than the strongest correlations noted for Participant 1.
- Balance of risk vs. protection:
  - For Participant 1, the high-impact risk factors (severe sleep restriction and nocturnal physiological arousal plus anxiety with a very strong sample correlation to PSS) outweigh the protective traits, yielding a robust inference of above-mean perceived stress.
  - For Participant 2, risk factors (depressive symptoms, sleep timing variability) are meaningful but are counterbalanced to a larger degree by strong lifestyle/physiological protections, suggesting a more moderate elevation above the population mean.
- Relative inferred magnitude above mean:
  - Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population means, but Participant 1’s profile indicates more severe stress-linked physiological and behavioral disruption that, given the sample-level correlations, likely corresponds to a larger upward deviation in perceived stress relative to the population mean than Participant 2.

Final determination
- Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",19,Pain,28,94579,NetHealth,17
14,87328,24,15,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; classified as disturbed sleep), which commonly elevates perceived stress even when total sleep time is adequate.  
- Late median sleep start (01:26 AM) and modestly elevated nap rate (0.18 naps/day), behaviors weakly associated with higher PSS in the sample.  
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (peak 6–7 PM, Z = 2.62), which can reflect sustained arousal and is modestly positively correlated with PSS.  
- Lower health satisfaction (Z = -1.20), a personal appraisal that can contribute to higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10.5) with a very strong correlation to PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77) — a primary predictor of higher perceived stress.  
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale) that correlates substantially with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8.5) and elevated pain/interference measures (PEG-3 mean 8.33; PAPAS Z = 1.21), both moderately correlated with PSS.  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2 AM (Z ≈ 1.25–1.36) and evening HR elevations, which have moderate positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- High night-to-night sleep variability (SD 199 min, Z = 0.65), which can exacerbate subjective stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is already interpreted relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.63); Participant 2 is inferred to be above their population mean PSS (mean = 20.92).  
- The strength and number of risk indicators differ: Participant 1’s few risk signals (sleep disturbance, late timing, evening HR) are relatively weakly correlated with PSS and are outweighed by multiple strong protective signals (very low depression and trait anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR, high social time).  
- Participant 2 shows several high-relevance, strongly correlated predictors of higher PSS (notably GAD-7 and emotional lability) plus corroborating nocturnal physiological arousal and poor sleep/pain—despite some protective factors (self-efficacy, circadian regularity, low resting HR). The survey-based anxiety and lability signals for Participant 2 are particularly predictive in that sample.

Overall judgment
- Balancing the evidence within each study’s context, Participant 2 has the stronger, more numerous, and more highly correlated indicators of elevated perceived stress, while Participant 1’s profile is dominated by protective factors and is assessed as below their population mean. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

- Elevated trait anxiety/negative affect: STAI–Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27, “anxious”); lower happiness and health satisfaction (health sat z ≈ −1.11) — affective signals that align with higher PSS.
- Late, somewhat shortened, and variable sleep timing: wearable median sleep ~6 h 51 min (z ≈ −0.42), sleep onset ~00:59, sleep start SD ≈ 89 min — later/shorter/more variable sleep patterns linked to higher PSS.
- High evening internet use: >4 hours (z ≈ +2.19) — behavioral pattern associated with late sleep and stress.
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular tone: resting HR = 64.8 bpm (z ≈ +0.79), mesor z ≈ +0.74 — modest association with higher PSS.
- Holistic summary in description: study authors infer P1’s PSS is above their population mean (population mean 21.64), described as a modest-to-moderate elevation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective and affective signals tied to stress: PSQI = 12 (raw indicates disturbed sleep) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability = 8.33 (z ≈ +0.53), where emotional lability strongly correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Marked physiological nocturnal arousal: substantial night-hour HR elevations (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- High baseline cardiovascular tone: resting HR = 78.21 bpm (z ≈ +1.37), mesor z ≈ +1.18 — larger effect sizes than Participant 1 on HR indices that have positive (though modest) associations with PSS.
- Extremely long and highly variable wearable sleep (median 12 h, SD huge; z ≈ +2.26 and +2.38) indicating severe sleep dysregulation; though wearable sleep quantity/variability have weak direct correlations with PSS in this dataset, they are often behaviorally/physiologically disruptive.
- However, protective signals: lower pain burden (PEG-3 z ≈ −1.39), good interpersonal functioning (z ≈ −1.77), mild GAD-7 (z ≈ −0.59). The study authors infer P2’s overall PSS is near their population mean (population mean 20.96), with some domain-specific elevations.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing the evidence
- Stated inferences: P1 is interpreted by the study authors as above their population mean PSS (moderate elevation). P2 is interpreted as near their population mean (not clearly elevated overall), despite some domain-specific risk signals.
- Strength and centrality of predictors: P1’s elevation is driven mainly by sleep disturbance (PSQI z +1.05), trait anxiety, late/variable shorter sleep, and high evening internet use; many of these (PSQI, STAI, sleep timing) have clear links to PSS in the sample. P2 shows stronger cardiovascular indicators of arousal (resting HR z +1.37, nocturnal HR spikes) and emotional lability (which correlates strongly with PSS), but these are partly offset by strong protective factors (low pain, good interpersonal function, only mild generalized anxiety) and the study authors still place P2 near the mean.
- Magnitude and consistency: P2’s HR elevation z-scores are larger than P1’s HR z-scores, and P2 has larger objective sleep irregularity; however, the study notes several of these wearable metrics have only weak correlations with PSS, reducing confidence that those physiological abnormalities translate into a higher overall perceived-stress rating. Conversely, P1’s elevated PSQI, trait anxiety, late/short sleep, and very high evening internet use are direct, consistent predictors of higher PSS in this dataset and are the basis for the explicit classification of P1 > mean.
- Net judgment: Given the authors’ within-population conclusions (P1 above mean; P2 near mean) and the pattern of multiple psychosocial predictors of PSS being more consistently elevated for P1 (subjective sleep, anxiety, behavior) while P2’s stronger physiological signals are counterbalanced by substantive protective psychosocial scores, the balance favors Participant 1 as the participant with higher overall perceived stress.

- Clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 33; Z = 2.05), a domain positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15; Z = 3.83), a strong indicator that commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z = 0.56), low current happiness (Z = -1.61), and below‑average self‑esteem — psychological signals that align with greater perceived stress.
- Physiological corroboration: mildly elevated resting HR (Z = 0.65) and higher intradaily variability of activity (IV Z = 0.81), consistent with greater arousal and circadian fragmentation that are associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- The narrative explicitly concludes the participant is most consistent with an above‑population‑mean PSS (moderately elevated).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Notable emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53), and in this study that domain correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Subjective sleep problems (raw PSQI = 12), and PSQI correlates substantially with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.50), even though the participant’s PSQI z is modestly negative versus this population.
- Elevated nocturnal heart‑rate deviations (e.g., +10.24 bpm at 1–2 AM) and a high resting HR/mesor (resting HR z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18); nocturnal HR deviations in this dataset correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), suggesting physiological arousal that can accompany higher perceived stress.
- Extremely long median sleep and very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (z-scores > 2) that indicate unstable sleep patterns which can be associated with stress‑related dysregulation, even if wearable sleep metrics have weak direct correlations with PSS here.

Comparative weighing (explicitly within each participant’s population frame):
- Magnitude of risky signals: Participant 1 shows very large deviations in domains tightly linked to self‑reported stress for their sample (notably PSQI Z = 3.83 and CES‑D Z = 2.05). Those large z‑scores indicate this person is substantially more symptomatic than the typical member of their population.
- Participant 2 has clear risk signals (emotional lability, nocturnal HR elevation, disturbed raw PSQI), and some of these measures have strong correlations with PSS in their sample. However, many of Participant 2’s z‑scores are moderate rather than extreme, and several strong protective signals (low pain, strong interpersonal functioning, only mild anxiety) pull the overall inference toward “near the population mean.”
- Overall, Participant 1’s combination of pronounced affective symptoms (large depression z), very high subjective sleep disturbance (very large PSQI z), and corroborating physiological markers is a stronger and more consistent signal of above‑mean perceived stress within their study frame than Participant 2’s mixed profile is within theirs.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9), which correlates substantially with PSS (r = 0.59).  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55), which show moderate positive correlations with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations at certain hours (e.g., 1–3am) that correlate with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.40–0.45), indicating sleep-related autonomic arousal linked to stress.  
- The summary explicitly infers perceived stress above the population mean (mean PSS = 20.75) after weighing signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Multiple wearable-derived physiological markers associated with higher PSS: elevated resting heart rate (75.5 bpm; Z = +2.06), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.81), low 24-h autocorrelation/amplitude (Z ≈ −1.85), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = +1.16). These objective features are associated with higher PSS in that sample (though correlations are modest, r ≈ 0.15–0.16).  
- Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations that show nighttime/evening elevations and a blunted day–night pattern, consistent with autonomic/circadian perturbation.  
- The summary infers perceived stress near the population mean (mean PSS = 21.62) with wearable physiology suggesting a lean toward above-mean stress.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Direction vs. population mean: Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean (20.75). Participant 2 is inferred to be near their population mean (21.62), with physiological signs that could nudge them slightly above but self-report indicates lower-than-average distress.  
- Strength of predictive signals: Participant 1’s strongest indicators of higher PSS are subjective measures (anxiety, emotional lability, poor sleep, pain) that have large correlations with PSS in that dataset (e.g., r = 0.80, 0.67, 0.59). These are direct measures of subjective experience and therefore highly relevant to PSS. Participant 2’s indicators of higher PSS are primarily objective physiological features that have only modest correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.15–0.16) and are contrasted by robust self-report evidence of low distress (low CES‑D/STAI, good sleep, good social engagement).  
- Magnitude and coherence: Participant 1 shows multiple coherent self-report risk factors that are strong PSS predictors. Participant 2 shows physiological risk markers but coherent, strong self-report protections; the physiological correlations with PSS are smaller in magnitude.

Conclusion
Given that Participant 1 presents several strong, directly relevant self-report predictors of higher perceived stress (and is explicitly inferred above their population mean), while Participant 2 is inferred near their mean with only modestly predictive physiological signals pushing toward higher stress but clear self-report protection, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- Pain-related interference: PEG‑3 average = 6.78 and PAPAS composite elevated; both correlate positively with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).  
- Circadian and sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = -0.68), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -0.35), and very high night‑to‑night sleep-duration variability (SD z = 1.7) — objective patterns commonly linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Some interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale above mean (z = 0.54).  

Protective factors are present (high self‑efficacy, no substance problems, long median sleep duration, normal resting HR), but the strongest correlates with PSS in this dataset (anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance) and objective circadian irregularity point toward being modestly above the study mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.64)
- High sedentary/screen-time engagement: extreme Z-scores for video games, TV, internet use (possible behavioral risk that can erode coping resources).  
- Low social-trust (Z ≈ -2.39), which could reflect reduced perceived social support and contribute to interpersonal stress.  
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:04 AM) and low exercise frequency, which can be associated with schedule/interpersonal strain and reduced stress buffering.  
- Modestly elevated cardiac tone: heart‑rate mesor and amplitude elevated (z ≈ 1.35 and 1.72), and resting HR slightly above average (z ≈ 0.51), which could reflect higher tonic arousal.  

However, these risk signals are described as smaller in magnitude and/or less strongly correlated with PSS in that sample than the protective signals.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s profile includes multiple indicators that are strongly linked to higher PSS in that sample (notably the high-correlation predictors: GAD‑7 and PSQI), plus objective circadian irregularity and pain interference. The synthesis explicitly concludes the participant is slightly above their study mean.  
- Participant 2’s strongest signals are robust protective indicators against PSS in that sample (very low CES‑D and STAI‑Trait, high self‑esteem and happiness, excellent circadian regularity and low sleep variability). Although Participant 2 has several behavioral risk factors (high sedentary time, low trust, late timing, modestly higher HR), the summary frames these as smaller effects and concludes this participant is below their study mean — likely substantially below (nearer the lower quartile).  
- Both descriptions are given relative to different study means, but that does not change the within-sample inference: Participant 1 = slightly above their population mean; Participant 2 = below their population mean, with strong protective signals. The magnitude and correlation strength of Participant 1’s key risk indicators (especially anxiety and poor subjective sleep) outweigh Participant 2’s behavioral risks when deciding which person has the higher perceived stress relative to their peers.

- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = -0.68), low 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -0.35), and very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD z = 1.7) — patterns associated with higher perceived stress in the sample.
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale above mean (z = 0.54), a modest contributor to PSS.

Protective/offsetting factors noted in the profile (reduce the likelihood or magnitude of PSS elevation): relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE z = 0.3; r with PSS = -0.65), no substance problems (z = -1.62), normative resting HR, and long median sleep duration (but highly variable). The study summary itself judges this profile as likely slightly above the population mean (i.e., modest elevation).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Strong elevations in internalizing symptoms: CES‑D = 32 (z = 1.95) and STAI = 58 (z = 1.65). Both measure types are positively correlated with PSS in the sample (CES‑D–PSS r ≈ 0.27; STAI–PSS r ≈ 0.31) and these are large deviations from the population mean.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing variability: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), late median sleep time (~01:15 AM) and substantial night‑to‑night variability — features that correlate positively with PSS.
- Elevated tonic/evening physiology: high mesor (z = 2.01) and higher resting HR (z = 1.62) with pronounced evening HR elevations — physiological signals that, together with elevated affective symptoms, support higher perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction and low BMI (z ≈ -2.03 and BMI = 17.8) increase the overall distress signal.

Protective/offsetting factors: adequate objective nightly sleep (≈7h16m), strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorr z ≈ 0.9–1.23), extensive social time (z = 2.53), and low substance use. The study summary judged this profile as above the population mean PSS.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study population means, but the nature and magnitude of the signals differ.
- Participant 1 has several predictors that are highly predictive of PSS in this sample (notably GAD‑7, r = 0.78; PSQI, r = 0.49; pain measures r ≈ 0.44–0.48). However, the absolute symptom levels reported are mixed: anxiety is only mild (GAD‑7 = 6), there are strong protective factors (high self‑efficacy z = 0.3, no substance problems z = -1.62), and the study authors judge the likely elevation as modest (slightly above mean).
- Participant 2 shows large deviations (high z-scores) on core internalizing measures (CES‑D z = 1.95; STAI z = 1.65). Although those measures have smaller correlations with PSS than Participant 1’s top predictor (GAD‑7), the magnitude and multiplicity of Participant 2’s affective elevations (depression + trait anxiety) and elevated physiological tone (mesor, resting HR) create a stronger, convergent signal of elevated stress relative to that study’s mean. Participant 2’s protective signs (good objective sleep duration, circadian regularity, strong social time) moderate but do not fully counterbalance the large affective and physiological deviations noted by the study authors, who also conclude P2 is above their population mean.

Overall balance of evidence and decision
- Both profiles indicate above‑mean perceived stress in their respective samples, but Participant 2 displays larger, convergent deviations on core affective measures (large z‑scores for depression and trait anxiety) plus elevated physiological arousal. Participant 1’s strongest statistical predictor (GAD‑7) is highly correlated with PSS but is only mildly elevated, and Participant 1 has stronger protective factors (notably self‑efficacy and no substance problems) that the summary judged sufficient to limit the inferred elevation to modest.
- Taking the within‑sample frames and the reported correlations together, Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (a larger elevation above their population mean).

17,79167,19,10,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their description)
- Severe self-reported anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = +1.25) — this measure has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.81), making it one of the most powerful predictors of higher PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83) and very short wearable-recorded median sleep (2 h 31 m; Z = −0.97) — PSQI also correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.51).
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.62), which is a strong inverse correlate of PSS (r ≈ −0.66).
- Pain/interference scores (PEG/PAPAS) moderately correlated with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (HR Z ≈ +1.5) consistent with sustained physiological arousal linked to stress.
- Behavioral markers (late, irregular sleep timing, emotional/functional disturbance) that align with higher perceived stress.
- The integrative interpretation in the description explicitly concludes the participant is above their population mean (21.12).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their description)
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.07), reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.74), and reduced rhythm amplitude (Z ≈ −1.03). These features in the sample are modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Some hourly HR deviations (pronounced morning peak) that have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (mitigating/protective evidence)
- Low trait anxiety (STAI Z = −1.71) and low depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = −1.07) — strong, direct self-report indicators that strongly favor below-mean PSS.
- High happiness and health-satisfaction (Zs +1.64 and +2.05), elevated self‑esteem (Z = +1.24).
- Good subjective and objective sleep (median sleep Z = +1.25; PSQI Z = −0.8).
- Protective behavioral profile (frequent exercise, low substance use, low screen time).
- Lower resting HR and mesor (Zs ≈ −0.65 to −0.81) consistent with lower tonic arousal.
- The integrative interpretation in the description explicitly concludes the participant is below their population mean (21.65).

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1 is characterized by several high-weight indicators (severe anxiety, poor sleep, low self-efficacy, elevated resting HR) that, in that study, have strong-to-moderate correlations with PSS. The description explicitly judges them to be above the study mean (21.12). The study SD for PSS is relatively large (SD = 7.52), but the combination of robust predictors (especially GAD‑7 and NGSE) points toward a substantial above-mean PSS.
- Participant 2 shows a largely protective self-report and behavioral profile (notably low trait anxiety and depression, good sleep, high well‑being), and the description concludes below-mean PSS relative to their sample (mean = 21.65, SD = 3.63). The wearable circadian irregularities that point toward higher stress are present but described as smaller-magnitude signals with modest associations to PSS and are outweighted by the strong, consistent self-report protective signals.
- Importantly, Participant 2’s population has a smaller PSS SD (3.63), so deviations in that sample are more tightly distributed; their protective z-scores (e.g., STAI Z = −1.71) suggest a meaningful below-mean position. Participant 1’s predictors (notably the severe GAD-7 and elevated HR) imply a clear above-mean position in their sample.

Balance of evidence and decision
- The preponderance of high-weight indicators for elevated perceived stress is with Participant 1 (severe anxiety, poor sleep, low self‑efficacy, elevated resting HR), and the description explicitly infers above-mean PSS.
- Participant 2 is inferred to be below their sample mean by multiple robust self-report and behavioral indicators; their circadian irregularities are weaker, partial counter-evidence.
- Comparing the two within their respective sample frames, Participant 1 appears to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Elevated mood/anxiety symptoms: CES‑D = 24 (Z ≈ 1.11, “Depressed”), STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86, “anxious”); both measures have positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Poor, late, and irregular sleep: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), median sleep start ≈ 01:44, high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z = 1.32). Sleep disturbance and variability are positively associated with PSS (though correlations are modest).  
- Reduced circadian regularity: lower interdaily stability, amplitude, and 24‑hour autocorrelation (Zs ≈ -0.5 to -0.7), consistent with patterns seen with higher stress.  
- Low social trust and lower health satisfaction (trust Z = -1.74; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95), which may increase vulnerability to stress.

Factors that temper the inference for Participant 1
- Several protective signals (very high self‑esteem, above‑average current happiness, regular exercise Z ≈ 1.07, low resting HR Z ≈ -0.61) which correlate negatively with PSS in the sample and could moderate perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from the description)
- Very high anxiety and poor subjective sleep: GAD‑7 = 16.5 (Z ≈ 1.25, “severe”) and PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ 0.83). In this study these two measures are strongly correlated with PSS (GAD‑7 r = 0.81; PSQI r = 0.51), making them high‑weight predictors of elevated PSS.  
- Low self‑efficacy and pain interference: NGSE = 27 (Z ≈ -0.62; NGSE correlates strongly inverse with PSS, r ≈ -0.66) and pain scores (PEG/PAPAS) that also correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.44–0.48).  
- Elevated physiological arousal: resting HR = 79.8 bpm (Z ≈ 1.53), mesor Z ≈ 1.49 — consistent with sustained arousal/stress.  
- Markedly short/irregular wearable sleep (median 2 h 31 min, Z ≈ -0.97; sleep start SD Z ≈ 0.98) plus corroborating very poor subjective sleep — converging signals for high stress.  
- Additional emotional/functional disturbance (BASIS‑24 elevations) that align with higher PSS.

Factors that temper the inference for Participant 2
- Some preserved circadian structure (interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.65, 24‑h autocorr Z ≈ 0.64, low intradaily variability) and a clear diurnal HR pattern — modest protective/organizing features, but they are lower‑weight relative to the above indicators.
- Wearable sleep median may undercount total sleep, but subjective PSQI strongly corroborates poor sleep.

Comparative considerations (within each study’s frame)
- Weight of predictors: Participant 2’s top predictors (severe GAD‑7 and very high PSQI) are tied to very large sample correlations with PSS (especially GAD‑7 r = 0.81). Those features are high‑weight, direct predictors of elevated PSS in that study. Participant 1’s strongest contributors (CES‑D and STAI) are meaningful but have more modest correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Magnitude and convergence: Participant 2 shows multiple, converging high‑weight signals (severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, elevated resting HR, low self‑efficacy, pain interference), whereas Participant 1 shows a mixed profile with strong mood/sleep signals but also notable protective factors (high self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR).  
- Sample dispersion: Participant 1’s study has a smaller PSS SD (3.66), so moderate deviations might translate into more consistent PSS departures; however, Participant 1’s predictors are moderate in strength and partially offset by protective factors. Participant 2’s study has a larger PSS SD (7.52), but the clinical severity and very strong PSS correlations of Participant 2’s indicators (especially GAD‑7) make a sizable above‑mean PSS highly plausible despite the larger sample variance.

Overall balance of evidence
- Both participants are assessed as likely above their respective study means. Comparing the two within their respective frames, Participant 2 has a greater number of high‑weight, strongly PSS‑related indicators (severe anxiety with extremely high correlation to PSS, very poor subjective sleep, elevated resting HR, low self‑efficacy and pain interference). Participant 1’s elevations are notable but less extreme and are mitigated by several robust protective signals. Therefore Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ 0.67). PSQI correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- High pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ 0.93). PAPAS also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.62). NGSE correlates strongly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so below-average NGSE is strongly associated with higher PSS here.
- Elevated cardiac tone metrics: higher mesor (Z ≈ 0.7), higher resting HR (Z ≈ 0.61), and notable nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–early-morning Zs up to ≈1.38) — these physiological features correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83), indicating less regular daily timing; small positive association with PSS in this dataset.

Mitigating/contrary signals (reduce likelihood of extreme PSS): relatively low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -0.76), long median nightly sleep duration (Z ≈ 0.92), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -1.28), and slightly lower emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.37).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Very large elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 37; Z ≈ 2.47) and trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 2.05). Both measures are salient affective signals that, in this cohort, are associated with higher PSS (correlations ~0.28–0.31).
- Low self-reported happiness (Z ≈ -1.61) and below-average self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ -1.29), which align with increased perceived stress.
- Elevated tonic cardiovascular activation: high mesor (Z ≈ 1.49) and elevated resting HR (Z ≈ 1.34), metrics that show positive associations with PSS in the sample.
- Subjective sleep impairment (PSQI Z ≈ 0.59) and late sleep timing (∼01:52 AM), consistent with circadian/subjective sleep patterns seen with higher stress and mood disturbance.

Mitigating/contrary signals (reduce likelihood of extreme PSS): objectively longer sleep duration (median ~8 h; Z ≈ 1.18) with low night-to-night variability, good interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation (Zs near/above mean), no recreational substance use, no naps, and preserved academic performance — these indicate maintained routines/functional domains.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both descriptions are written relative to their own sample means. For Participant 1 the strongest stress-related signals are pain (PAPAS), subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI), low self-efficacy (NGSE), and nocturnal HR elevations. Notably, NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ -0.69), amplifying the relevance of the below-average NGSE score.
- For Participant 2 the most striking features are very large affective symptom elevations (CES-D and STAI Zs > 2). Although the CES-D/STAI correlations with PSS are more modest (~0.28–0.31) than some of Participant 1’s correlations, the magnitude of Participant 2’s deviations from the cohort mean on these mood/anxiety measures is far greater than Participant 1’s deviations on any single affective measure.
- Physiologically, both participants show elevated cardiac tone (Participant 1: elevated nocturnal HR and mesor/RHR Zs ~0.6–1.4; Participant 2: mesor/RHR Zs ~1.3–1.5). Thus physiological evidence of elevated tonic activation is present in both, somewhat stronger in Participant 2 on mesor/RHR and in Participant 1 for nocturnal HR spikes.
- Participant 1’s strongest correlational lever is NGSE (strong negative correlation with PSS) plus PSQI/PAPAS (moderate correlations). Participant 2’s strongest lever is very large affective symptom burden (CES-D, STAI) despite more modest PSS correlations per item; the absolute magnitude of these affective deviations is large and functionally meaningful.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Participant 1: multiple moderate-to-strong stress-related signals (pain, subjective sleep, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR) indicating PSS above that study mean, likely at a moderate elevation.
- Participant 2: extremely elevated depressive and trait-anxiety scores (Zs > 2), plus elevated tonic cardiac metrics and low wellbeing/self-esteem, indicating PSS above that study mean and likely at a larger elevation than Participant 1’s elevation.

Given that Participant 2’s affective symptom scores are far more extreme relative to their cohort (Zs > 2) and are accompanied by physiological elevation (mesor/RHR Zs ≈ 1.3–1.5) and multiple low-wellbeing indicators, the overall balance favors Participant 2 as exhibiting the higher perceived stress (relative to their respective study populations).

22,89142,10,0,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean)
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z = +0.83) and wearable evidence of disrupted/very short nocturnal recording — PSQI has a moderate-to-strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 (Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS (Z ≈ +0.80) are elevated and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), pushing perceived stress upward.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: modest positive heart-rate deviations around midnight–early morning that have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS, consistent with nocturnal arousal tied to sleep problems.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not as elevated) PSS
- Very low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ −1.2) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ −1.17). GAD-7 is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.75), so these are powerful protective signals lowering inferred PSS.
- Higher self-efficacy (NGSE) inversely correlated with PSS (r ≈ −0.68).
- Good interpersonal functioning and robust wearable circadian/cardiovascular indicators (low intradaily variability, higher HR amplitude, low resting HR) associated with lower PSS.
- Integrated interpretation from the description: overall placement near the cohort mean with only a modest uplift from sleep and pain.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean)
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI Z ≈ +0.66 (positive correlation with PSS, r ≈ 0.34), a relevant risk signal.
- Very low health satisfaction: Z ≈ −2.45 (large deviation), which—despite a small correlation with PSS—represents a notable negative subjective health signal that commonly aligns with higher stress.
- Short and somewhat variable objective sleep: median ≈ 5 h 50 min (Z ≈ −1.68) and sleep SD Z ≈ +0.51, patterns that are commonly linked to increased stress and daytime dysfunction.
- Lifestyle/contextual risk signals: minimal exercise (Zs ≈ −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), and low reported happiness (Z ≈ −0.53) — these cluster to create a context conducive to higher perceived stress.
- The description explicitly infers perceived stress modestly above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or not as elevated) PSS
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ −1.26) and low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ −0.14), both protective.
- Reasonably stable circadian wearable metrics (interdaily stability slightly above average, intradaily variability below average).
- Low resting heart rate and MESOR (Zs ≈ −1.49 and −1.89), and no substance use — physiological and behavioral buffers against higher PSS.
- Overall the description frames these protections as attenuating risk, but not fully overturning it.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame and weighing evidence
- Both participants are inferred as “modestly above” or near their respective population means, but the nature and strength of the signals differ.
- Participant 1’s principal risk signals (sleep disturbance, pain/interference) are moderate-to-strong predictors of higher PSS. However, Participant 1 also shows very strong protective psychological signals (notably very low GAD-7 and low emotional lability) that have strong correlations with PSS in that cohort (especially GAD-7, r ≈ 0.75) and thus substantially reduce the likelihood of a markedly elevated PSS. The net inference given is near the sample mean with only a modest uplift.
- Participant 2 shows multiple converging risk signals (elevated trait anxiety, very low health satisfaction, objectively short sleep, low exercise/social engagement), and several of those deviations are substantial in magnitude (especially health satisfaction and short sleep). Although Participant 2 does have protective features (good subjective PSQI, low depression, stable circadian markers, low resting HR), the combination of behavioral deficits and pronounced subjective health dissatisfaction creates a broader pattern consistent with higher-than-average perceived stress in that study population.
- Relative predictive strength: some of Participant 1’s protective indicators are tightly coupled to PSS in that sample (strong correlations), making those protections especially meaningful. Participant 2’s strongest risk marker (health satisfaction) has a weaker sample-level correlation with PSS, but its very large deviation plus accompanying behavioral risks (sleep, activity, social/happiness) produce a more consistently elevated risk profile overall.

Conclusion
- Although both participants are described as around or modestly above their sample means, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to have the higher overall perceived stress relative to their study population (i.e., Participant 2’s pattern shows broader and more consistent risk signals with fewer psychologically strong protective factors than Participant 1).

- Late habitual sleep timing (~01:58 AM) and somewhat reduced median nightly sleep duration (6 h 50 min, z ≈ -0.44) — both known to increase daytime strain and correlate with higher PSS in many samples.
- Reduced socializing (z ≈ -0.62) and somewhat lower self‑reported happiness (z ≈ -0.53), which are associated with higher perceived stress in the cohort.
- Evening/nighttime heart‑rate elevations (notable positive deviations around 5–6pm and 11pm–12am, with some z > 1) that could reflect evening arousal, activity, or cognitive/emotional activation that may increase perceived stress or interfere with sleep.
- These risk signs could elevate PSS under situational pressures (e.g., deadlines, exams).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 16 (z = 0.83) and PSQI–PSS correlation r ≈ 0.58 in this sample — a strong predictor that pulls inferred PSS upward.
- Wearable-derived median sleep duration is extremely short (1 h 44 min, z = -1.24) and highly irregular sleep timing (start-time SD ≈ 160 min), consistent with substantial nocturnal disruption (even allowing for possible non-wear/measurement artifacts).
- Elevated pain and activity interference: PEG-3 (z = 0.71) and PAPAS composite (z = 0.8), each moderately correlated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal that align with sleep problems and may contribute to perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Participant 1 is described overall as having stronger, consistent protective signals (lower trait anxiety z = -0.82, relatively low depressive symptoms, higher self‑esteem z = 0.82, higher circadian amplitude z = 0.75, very low intradaily variability z = -1.31) and only moderate risk signals (late sleep, modestly short sleep duration, reduced socializing, evening HR elevations). The summary explicitly infers PSS below the population mean (mean = 21.62).
- Participant 2 has a mixed profile: strong protective signals (very low GAD-7 z = -1.2, high amplitude z = 1.38, low intradaily variability z = -1.35, low resting HR z = -1.02, good self‑efficacy) but also several fairly strong risk signals that are well‑correlated with PSS in this cohort — notably high PSQI (z = 0.83) and elevated pain/interference (z ≈ 0.7–0.8). The summary infers PSS near the population mean (mean = 21.5) with a modest upward contribution from sleep disturbance and pain.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple consistent protective indicators and only moderate/ambiguous risk indicators → inferred PSS below their study mean.
- Participant 2: several high-impact risk indicators (PSQI, pain/interference) that have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in their sample, even though they also have robust protective features → inferred PSS at or modestly above their study mean.
- Because each description is relative to its own population mean, Participant 2’s combination of strongly predictive risk factors (especially subjective sleep disturbance and pain) yields a higher within‑sample inferred PSS than Participant 1’s profile, which is characterized more strongly by protective markers.

24,90079,33,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean 20.54)
- Very elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = 1.51) — this measure has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in that sample (r = 0.74), making it a powerful predictor of above-mean PSS.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5; Z = 1.65), a moderately strong predictor of PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03; r = 0.63), increased pain/interference (PEG-3 elevated), and lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; r = -0.66) — multiple subjective indices that are each meaningfully correlated with PSS and converge on higher perceived stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely above the population mean PSS, and emphasizes that subjective signals (with larger effect sizes) outweigh the protective physiologic markers.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean 21.61)
- Objective sleep restriction (median nightly sleep ≈ 5 h 54 min; Z ≈ -1.59) and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) — both associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian/HR signs of dysregulation: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.65), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.44), low amplitude (Z ≈ -1.37), and modestly elevated resting HR (Z ≈ 0.89). These objective features are linked—albeit modestly—to higher PSS in that dataset.
- Sleep timing and duration variability (sleep start SD and day-to-day SD elevated) further point toward stress-linked behavioral irregularity.
- The study summary judges the participant likely moderately above their population mean PSS (but not extreme), despite trait anxiety and depressive symptoms being near/below average.

Comparative/within-population reasoning
- Both descriptions infer above-mean PSS for their respective populations, but the strength and provenance of evidence differ.
- Participant 1’s elevation is driven by multiple, strongly predictive subjective measures (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, NGSE) that have large correlations with PSS in that sample—these provide a robust signal of higher perceived stress.
- Participant 2’s elevation is driven mainly by objective sleep/circadian disturbance and modest physiological markers; these features have smaller correlations with PSS in that dataset and the participant’s self-report psychopathology (CES-D, STAI) is near or below the cohort mean, weakening the case for very high PSS.
- Population mean PSS differs slightly (P1 mean = 20.54; P2 mean = 21.61), but this does not override the relative strength of predictors: Participant 1 shows stronger, high-effect-size subjective predictors of PSS, whereas Participant 2 shows moderate-to-small-effect-size physiological/circadian predictors and limited subjective symptom elevations.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Overall, Participant 1 presents a stronger and more directly relevant pattern of elevated predictors of perceived stress (especially severe anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) than Participant 2, whose deviations are more physiological and of smaller effect size and whose self-reported mood/anxiety are near average.
- Therefore Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) overall perceived stress.

- Objective sleep restriction: median nightly sleep ≈ 5 h 54 min (z ≈ −1.59), which in this dataset is associated with higher PSS.
- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 7 (z ≈ 0.13) aligns with sleep-related stress signals.
- Circadian instability and fragmentation: low interdaily stability (0.21, z ≈ −1.65) and elevated intradaily variability (0.75, z ≈ 1.44); these features correlate modestly with higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated resting heart rate (65.6 bpm, z ≈ 0.89) and evening HR elevations — modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Variability in sleep timing and day-to-day sleep duration (sleep start SD z ≈ 0.46; sleep-duration SD z ≈ 0.84) which weakly track with higher PSS.
- Overall pattern: several physiological/circadian indicators deviate meaningfully from sample mean and point toward above-mean perceived stress.

Protective/contraindicating factors for Participant 1 (reducing likelihood of a very high PSS)
- Psychological symptom scales (CES-D, STAI-Trait) are near or below sample mean (z ≈ 0.07 and −0.33).
- Minimal substance use, moderate social/recreational engagement, and only modestly lower self-esteem — all factors that reduce the probability of extreme PSS elevation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 15.5 (z ≈ 0.67). In this sample PSQI correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- High pain/functional impairment: PAPAS = 81 (z ≈ 0.93), which also correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE z ≈ −0.62; NGSE correlates strongly and negatively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.69), so this is a substantial risk marker.
- Elevated circadian/HR markers associated with PSS: higher mesor and RHR (z ≈ 0.7 and 0.61) and notably elevated nocturnal HR deviations (Zs up to ≈1.38) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.83), indicating less regular daily timing associated with higher PSS.

Protective/contraindicating factors for Participant 2
- Lower-than-average anxiety severity (GAD-7 = 5, z ≈ −0.76); given strong correlation between anxiety and PSS (r ≈ 0.76), this reduces likelihood of extreme PSS.
- Low intradaily variability (IV = 0.17, z ≈ −1.28) and relatively long median nightly sleep (8 h 4 m, z ≈ 0.92) are potential mitigating factors.

Comparative reasoning (within-population frames)
- Both participants are interpreted as likely above their respective population PSS means.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are objective: short sleep, marked circadian instability (large negative IS z and positive IV z), and modestly elevated RHR. However, Participant 1’s subjective psychological symptom scores are near/below average, and several protective behaviors (low substance use, social engagement) temper the inference.
- Participant 2’s strongest signals are a mix of subjective and objective measures that, in this dataset, show relatively strong sample-level associations with PSS: very poor PSQI, high pain/PAPAS, low self-efficacy (NGSE), and elevated nocturnal HR. Several of these measures have higher correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., NGSE r ≈ −0.69; PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53) than many of Participant 1’s top indicators. Although Participant 2 has some protective elements (lower GAD-7, long sleep duration, low IV), the high-impact subjective signals (poor sleep quality, pain, low self-efficacy) are especially suggestive of elevated perceived stress.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s large z deviations are concentrated in circadian/sleep timing metrics, but those metrics in this dataset have only modest correlations with PSS. Participant 2 shows multiple moderate-to-large z deviations on measures that have stronger sample-level correlations with PSS (subjective sleep quality, pain, self-efficacy, nocturnal HR), suggesting a stronger net relation to higher PSS.

Overall judgment
- Weighing the balance of evidence (strength of z deviations plus the known sample-level correlations with PSS), Participant 2’s profile provides a stronger, more convergent set of indicators that are linked to higher perceived stress in their study (notably very poor PSQI, high pain, low self-efficacy, and elevated nocturnal HR). Participant 1 likely has elevated PSS relative to their sample, but the evidence is more mixed because psychological symptom scores are not elevated and the most extreme deviations are on circadian timing metrics that are less strongly correlated with PSS in this dataset.

2,69057,38,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z ≈ +1.16). Trait anxiety has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31).
- Objectively and subjectively poor sleep: median wearable sleep ~5 h 35 min (Z ≈ −1.99) and PSQI = 7 (disturbed range). Short/poor sleep is commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity: lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.74) and elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.39), plus late sleep timing and pronounced evening HR peak (HR acrophase ~5:40 PM; large evening deviation Z ≈ +1.79). These factors suggest delayed timing and elevated evening activation that can accompany greater perceived stress.
- Contextual stressor: academic decline (GPA drop from 3.1 to 2.28) and lower-than-average self-rated health and happiness, which tend to co-occur with higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or mitigated) PSS score
- Strong protective physiological/behavioral indicators: very low resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ −1.73 and −2.19), frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), low substance use, regular socializing, and low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ −0.14). These factors often buffer perceived stress and coping.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high anxiety (GAD-7 = 21; Z ≈ +2.04, “severe”). In this study GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.71), making it a powerful predictor.
- Extremely poor subjective sleep and objective sleep restriction: PSQI = 18 (Z ≈ +1.49) and median sleep ~3 h 42 min with large night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min). Sleep metrics here are more extreme than Participant 1’s and are strongly related to PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.41).
- High pain and pain-interference (PEG-3/PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28), and marked emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42), both consistent with elevated stress burden.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), which is negatively associated with PSS and suggests fewer perceived coping resources.
- Wearable indices consistent with circadian fragmentation and nocturnal physiological arousal (early-night positive HR deviations that have moderate positive correlations with PSS, r ≈ 0.48–0.51). Overall objective sleep and circadian disruption here aligns closely with self-reported dysfunction.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or mitigated) PSS score
- Some protective features: minimal substance-use problems (Z ≈ −1.62), relatively preserved interpersonal functioning (Z ≈ −1.07), and a relatively low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.93) that may reflect fitness and partial buffering.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both profiles are explicitly characterized as above their respective study means. However, the strength and number of risk indicators differ in magnitude. Participant 2 shows multiple large Z deviations (severe anxiety Z ≈ +2.04; emotional lability Z ≈ +2.42; pain Z ≈ +2.28; very short sleep ~3 h 42 min) and the single strongest predictor in the dataset (GAD-7, r ≈ 0.71) is highly elevated. Objective sleep restriction is far more extreme in Participant 2 than in Participant 1.
- Participant 1 does have meaningful risk signals (notably short sleep vs sample and elevated trait anxiety) but also several substantial protective factors (very low resting HR/mesor, frequent exercise, low depressive symptoms, active socializing). The magnitudes of Participant 1’s risk indicators are generally more moderate (STAI Z ≈ +1.16; sleep shorter but not as extreme as Participant 2).
- Correlational strengths matter: predictors that are both highly elevated and strongly correlated with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 in Participant 2) argue more for higher PSS than more modest predictors. Participant 2’s profile therefore carries a stronger and more coherent signal of high perceived stress than Participant 1’s profile, even after accounting for within-sample framing.

Weighted conclusion
- Considering the relative magnitudes (Z-scores), the number and severity of risk indicators, and the strength of associations with PSS in each sample, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

23,69057,17,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (risk indicators in their description)
- Clinically elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), which in this study correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.48).
- Extremely short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) and large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), both linked with higher perceived stress in the literature/sample.
- Marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +12 to +14 bpm; z > 1); the 1–2 AM deviation has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.46), suggesting nocturnal arousal that could elevate PSS.
- The profile is mixed (sleep-related distress despite low daytime anxiety), so if the participant’s subjective focus is on sleep problems, their perceived stress could be higher than other indicators suggest.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (risk indicators in their description)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z = +1.16), a psychometric risk factor that in this sample is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Both objectively short sleep (median ≈ 5 h 35 min; Z ≈ −1.99) and subjectively poor sleep (PSQI = 7), which are commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation (lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability) and late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:08) with pronounced evening heart-rate activation—habitual patterns associated with greater stress in the sample, even if correlations are modest.
- Contextual psychosocial stressors (academic decline/GPA drop) and lowered health satisfaction/happiness that add to likely perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Each summary explicitly interprets the participant relative to their own study’s mean PSS: Participant 1’s integrated inference is that they are likely below their population mean (population mean = 21.21), despite notable sleep-related risk signals. Participant 2’s integrated inference is that they are above their population mean (population mean = 21.6), based on converging anxiety, sleep, circadian, and contextual indicators.
- Strength of predictors differs: Participant 1’s strongest protective signals (very low GAD-7; high NGSE) are measures that have large correlations with PSS in that sample (GAD-7 r = 0.77, NGSE r = −0.65), providing powerful evidence toward lower PSS despite severe sleep disturbance. Participant 2’s risk signals are multiple and consistent (anxiety, short/poor sleep, circadian irregularity, academic stress), but the individual correlations with PSS reported are generally smaller than the GAD-7/NGSE associations in Participant 1’s sample.
- However, Participant 1’s objective sleep (≈4.4 h) and very high PSQI (10.5) are more extreme on the sleep dimension than Participant 2’s sleep metrics (≈5.6 h, PSQI = 7). That said, in Participant 1’s dataset the strongest predictors of PSS are the daytime trait measures, which point toward lower PSS; in Participant 2’s dataset, multiple moderate predictors converge on higher PSS.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Participant 1: Mixed profile but the most highly weighted predictors (very low anxiety, higher self-efficacy with large sample correlations to PSS) point toward PSS below their study mean.
- Participant 2: Multiple converging risk factors (trait anxiety, objective and subjective short/poor sleep, circadian irregularity, contextual academic stress and lowered well-being) lead the study summary to infer PSS above their study mean.
- Taking the within-sample inferences together, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their peers than Participant 1 is relative to theirs. Even allowing for Participant 1’s severe sleep problems, the strong protective trait signals and the explicit integrated inference place Participant 1 below their mean, whereas Participant 2 is explicitly inferred above their mean.

- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51) — this measure has a very strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75).  
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) and objectively short/late sleep (median start ≈ 01:42; median duration ≈ 4 h 55 m) — both linked to higher PSS.  
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS and reduce coping capacity.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a strong negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive heart-rate deviations overnight (several hourly Zs >2) with some positive correlations to PSS, consistent with hyperarousal.  
- The magnitude of several signals (Z-scores and correlations) is relatively large, producing a coherent high-stress profile despite some resilience markers.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6; above the clinical threshold) — this often associates with higher PSS, though PSQI Z is modest.  
- Late and somewhat variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:25; start-time SD Z ≈ 0.35) and elevated intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ 0.74), both of which have small positive correlations with PSS.  
- Small positive correlations of some early-morning HR deviations with PSS (suggesting modest nighttime physiology links to stress).  
- Overall, these risk indicators are modest in size (small Zs and small correlations) and contrasted with multiple stronger protective signals.

Comparative, within-sample-frame reasoning
- Each profile is expressed relative to its own study mean (Participant 1: mean PSS = 20.62; Participant 2: mean PSS = 21.62). The descriptions explicitly infer Participant 1 > their sample mean and Participant 2 < their sample mean.  
- Strength and consistency of signals: Participant 1 shows multiple large-effect, convergent indicators of elevated perceived stress (severe anxiety, high PSQI, high pain, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR arousal). Many of these have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 2 shows mostly small-to-modest risk indicators (PSQI just above threshold, late/variable timing, IV) but also several strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety and depression, high happiness/health satisfaction, low resting HR, normal mesor/amplitude, healthy behaviors).  
- Effect-size comparison: Participant 1’s key stress-related Z-scores and correlations are larger (e.g., anxiety r ≈ 0.75; PAPAS Z ≈ 1.63; nocturnal HR Zs >2) compared with Participant 2’s risk signals (Zs ≈ 0.3–0.7 and small correlations).  
- Population mean difference (21.62 vs 20.62) is small and does not materially change the within-sample inference that Participant 1 is substantially above their cohort mean while Participant 2 is below theirs.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) than Participant 2. Participant 1’s profile contains larger, more convergent symptom and physiological markers tied to higher PSS; Participant 2’s risk markers are weaker and offset by stronger protective indicators.

- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 16 (well above clinical threshold) and PSQI has a strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58). This is a substantive upward predictor of PSS.
- Wearable sleep metrics consistent with serious nocturnal disruption (median recorded sleep 1 hr 44 min, high sleep start-time variability), which aligns with the elevated PSQI and reinforces the sleep-related risk for higher PSS.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 7.78; PAPAS = 78.0) that moderately correlate with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), providing an additional push upward.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (midnight–early morning) that modestly correlate with higher PSS, consistent with nocturnal arousal.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or not-high) PSS
- Very low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 2.5) and low emotional lability, both strongly inversely associated with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.75), which are major protective signals.
- Higher self-efficacy and good interpersonal functioning (NGSE, BASIS-24 subscales) that correlate strongly with lower PSS.
- Robust circadian/physiological resilience signals (low intradaily variability, higher HR rhythm amplitude, low resting HR) that weakly predict lower PSS.
- Daytime HR pattern consistent with activity/engagement rather than chronic hyperarousal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population mean = 21.62)
- PSQI = 6 (meets threshold for disturbed subjective sleep), which is associated with higher PSS, though the PSQI Z here is small.
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.74) indicating more fragmented day activity/HR patterns; IV has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Late and somewhat variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:25; start-time SD Z = 0.35), which has a small positive association with PSS.
- Some early-morning HR deviations with small positive correlations with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or not-high) PSS
- Low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI–Trait Z ≈ -1.51; CES-D Z ≈ -0.97), both strongly associated with lower PSS — these are powerful protective indicators.
- High current happiness and health satisfaction (Z = 1.64 and 1.3), which tend to map to lower PSS.
- Objective physiology and circadian summary metrics near or better than sample mean (resting HR low, mesor/amplitude/IS ≈ mean), suggesting no strong physiological hyperarousal.
- Healthy behaviors (low substance use, regular exercise, socializing) that align with lower perceived stress.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both descriptions are written relative to their own study means (P1 mean 21.5; P2 mean 21.62). Each participant shows mixed signals, but the balance of evidence differs in magnitude and type.
- Participant 1’s strongest risk signals (very high PSQI and striking wearable sleep disruption plus moderately high pain/interference) are moderate-to-strong correlates of PSS in that sample and are substantial drivers toward higher PSS. Although P1 has strong protective factors (very low anxiety, high self-efficacy, robust circadian metrics), the sleep and pain signals are notable and were explicitly interpreted by the study as causing a modest uplift above the population mean.
- Participant 2’s risk signals are relatively mild: PSQI just over the threshold, intradaily variability and late sleep timing with only small correlations to PSS. In contrast, P2 has multiple strong protective signals (low anxiety/depression, high happiness/health satisfaction, normal physiology and lifestyle). The study explicitly infers P2’s overall perceived stress is likely below the population mean.
- The magnitude of P1’s sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16) and pain scores appears larger and more strongly predictive of higher PSS than P2’s modest sleep/timing irregularities. P2’s strongest signals point toward lower stress.

Overall judgment
- Given that Participant 1 is described as near the sample mean but with a “modest uplift” due to substantial sleep disturbance and pain (moderate-to-strong PSS correlates), while Participant 2 is described as likely below their sample mean with mostly protective indicators and only mild risk signs, Participant 1 most plausibly has the higher perceived stress.

- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12; Z ≈ 0.46) with a very strong correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.77) — the single strongest PSS predictor described.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; Z ≈ 1.32) with a substantive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–3am deviations Z ≈ 0.7–1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (≈0.22–0.39), indicating nocturnal autonomic arousal/poor recovery.
- Low self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.25) with a strong negative association to PSS (r ≈ −0.66), and elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24) correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.68).

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each profile is described relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.62; P2 mean = 20.67). Participant 1 is characterized as near the sample mean, “likely within one standard deviation” and only “plausibly slightly above” it. Several strong protective factors (very long, good subjective sleep; high exercise and social engagement; robust circadian amplitude/autocorrelation) meaningfully mitigate the stress signal.
- Participant 2 is characterized as above the sample mean, and the profile contains multiple high‑impact, convergent predictors of PSS (especially GAD‑7 with r ≈ 0.77 and very poor PSQI Z ≈ 1.32) plus nocturnal autonomic signs. Although Participant 2 has some protective signs (adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR), the most predictive measures point toward an above‑mean PSS.
- Effect sizes and predictive strength favor Participant 2: the psychological predictors in Participant 2 (GAD‑7, PSQI, emotional lability, NGSE) have larger correlations with PSS and more extreme z‑scores on stress‑relevant measures than the largely moderate signals in Participant 1 (trait anxiety r ≈ 0.31, but strong restorative sleep and social buffers).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed signals but overall near‑mean PSS; protective behavioral physiology (strong sleep, exercise, social support) counterbalances moderate anxiety and daytime arousal.
- Participant 2: multiple, strongly PSS‑linked elevations (anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, nocturnal HR, emotional lability) that outweigh protective signs and are explicitly interpreted as above the study mean.

- Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ −0.73) and lower current happiness (Z ≈ −0.53), both of which correlate negatively with PSS and can contribute to higher perceived stress.  
- Recurrent daytime physiological arousal: very large morning HR deviation (+30.3 bpm, Z ≈ +3.52) and a pronounced late-afternoon elevation (+22.3 bpm, Z ≈ +2.0). These stable time-of-day HR spikes plausibly reflect recurring acute demands/stressors and are associated with higher PSS in the sample.  
- Modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.46), indicating within-day rhythm fragmentation that has a small positive correlation with PSS.  
- Small positive association of resting HR with PSS (participant’s resting HR Z ≈ +0.07), supporting a possible modest contribution of tonic arousal to perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) and a moderate PSQI–PSS correlation (r ≈ 0.42), which is a plausible source of elevated perceived stress for this individual.  
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning negative deviations, Z ≈ −2 to −2.7) that show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31); these could modestly associate with stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each summary is benchmarked to its own cohort mean (P1 mean 21.62; P2 mean 21.5). Participant 1’s profile is described as near the cohort mean and “plausibly slightly above” it, with mixed signals: notable dispositional/physiological stress markers (trait anxiety, large recurrent HR spikes) but also strong protective factors (long restorative sleep, robust circadian amplitude, frequent exercise, strong social support). The net inference given is near-average PSS, possibly modestly above mean.  
- Participant 2’s profile is described as clearly below the cohort mean: very strong protective indicators (maximal self-efficacy, very low GAD-7, low interpersonal/emotional distress, high interdaily stability and amplitude, very low resting HR) outweigh an isolated countervailing signal (subjective sleep disturbance). The summary states the most defensible conclusion is PSS below the study mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows multiple strong, highly correlated protective indicators (especially very low anxiety and very high self-efficacy) that strongly predict lower PSS in that sample; their counterevidence (PSQI) is singular and moderate in effect size.  
- Participant 1 shows several risk indicators for higher PSS (trait anxiety, low self-esteem/happiness, and pronounced, repeated daytime HR surges) that are more directly linked to higher perceived stress in the cohort, and the summary explicitly allows that their PSS may be modestly above the cohort mean.  
- Because each description is relative to its own cohort, and Participant 1 is characterized as near/possibly slightly above the mean while Participant 2 is characterized as below the mean, the comparative interpretation favors Participant 1 as having the higher PSS.

- Very large elevations on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; z ≈ +1.95) and substantial trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ +1.25), both of which are positively correlated with PSS in this sample.  
- Low self-esteem and low current happiness (both sizable negative z-scores) that reflect broad negative affect and self-evaluation likely to co-occur with higher perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) and late-night physiological arousal (marked evening HR elevations around 9–11 PM) consistent with stress-related evening rumination/arousal.  
- Slightly above-average alcohol use (z ≈ +1.0) that could reflect coping behavior in a higher-stress context.  
- The integrated interpretation in the description explicitly concludes the participant is plausibly above the population mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean):
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 12). Although the z is modest (≈ 0.46), GAD-7 in this dataset has a very strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so even a moderate elevation is highly predictive of higher perceived stress.  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI z ≈ +1.32), a measure that correlates moderately with PSS and is substantially elevated here.  
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: overnight heart-rate deviations with z-scores up to ~1.0 and positive correlations with PSS, indicating impaired nighttime recovery.  
- Reduced self-efficacy and emotional lability measures that correlate strongly with PSS, supporting greater stress susceptibility.  
- The integrated interpretation likewise concludes above-mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative reasoning across frames (within each study population):
- Magnitude of symptom elevations: Participant 1 shows very large psychological symptom magnitudes (CES-D z ≈ +1.95; STAI z ≈ +1.25). Participant 2’s largest single z is PSQI ≈ +1.32 and GAD-7 is only ≈ +0.46. On raw standardized magnitude of distress-related self-report, Participant 1 presents the larger deviations from their sample norms.  
- Predictive strength (measure correlation with PSS): Some of Participant 2’s predictors have stronger correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; PSQI r ≈ 0.45; emotional-lability r ≈ 0.68), meaning even moderate elevations are highly informative about higher PSS. Participant 1’s most elevated scales (CES-D, STAI) have more modest correlations with PSS (≈ 0.29–0.32), but the absolute z-scores for those scales are substantially larger.  
- Physiological corroboration: Participant 2 shows clear nocturnal HR elevations (z up to ~1.0) which converge with subjective reports of very poor sleep quality; Participant 1 shows evening HR elevation (9–11 PM) but otherwise fairly resilient circadian metrics and adequate sleep duration/regularity. Thus physiological evidence for impaired recovery/nighttime arousal is stronger and more consistent for Participant 2.  
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s extremely elevated depressive symptoms plus elevated trait anxiety and low happiness/self-esteem argue for a higher subjective-stress burden in absolute magnitude relative to their sample. Participant 2 has several high-impact predictors with strong PSS correlations (notably GAD-7’s predictive value, very poor PSQI, and nocturnal HR elevations), but the standardized magnitudes of psychological symptom escalation are generally smaller than Participant 1’s largest deviations.

Weighing the evidence:
- Participant 1: very large self-report distress (esp. depression) but with notable objective resilience (regularity, adequate sleep duration). Overall judged above mean, likely substantially so given CES-D ~ +1.95 SD.  
- Participant 2: above-mean PSS driven by anxiety-sleep-autonomic convergence; measures are strongly predictive of PSS but their standardized magnitudes (except PSQI) are more modest than Participant 1’s largest elevations.

- Low self-esteem and low current happiness (RSES z ≈ −1.85; happiness z ≈ −1.61), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) — these subjective markers align with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral/physiological signs consistent with stress: late habitual sleep onset (~01:21 AM) and pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (large positive deviations 9–11 PM) that suggest evening arousal, plus slightly above-average alcohol use (z ≈ +1.0).
- The integrated interpretation in the write-up explicitly places this participant above the study mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16, z = +0.83) and wearable-indicated very short median sleep (1 h 44 min; z ≈ −1.24) — PSQI has a strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is an important upward driver.
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS z ≈ +0.8), both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with nocturnal arousal that could raise perceived stress.

Comparative, within-sample framing and weighing of evidence
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their population mean PSS; key predictors (CES-D and STAI) are substantially elevated (large positive z-scores) and are directly and moderately correlated with PSS in that sample. Those elevations are large signal contributors toward a higher PSS.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near the study mean PSS (with only a modest upward push). Although they have important risk factors (poor sleep and pain), these are moderate elevations (z ≈ +0.7–0.8) and the write-up emphasizes robust protective signals (very low GAD-7 z ≈ −1.2, high self-efficacy, regular circadian metrics, low resting HR) that strongly counterbalance the risk signals. The summary explicitly concludes the participant is near the mean, possibly slightly above.
- Relative magnitudes: Participant 1’s strongest predictors of PSS show larger deviations from their sample mean (CES-D z ≈ +1.95, STAI z ≈ +1.25) than Participant 2’s principal risk indicators (PSQI z ≈ +0.83, pain z ≈ +0.7–0.8). Participant 2 also has strong protective markers (notably GAD-7 z ≈ −1.2 with a high correlation to PSS) that reduce the likelihood of markedly elevated PSS.
- Both descriptions caution about measurement caveats (e.g., wearable sleep for P2), but these do not outweigh the larger, convergent subjective distress signal for Participant 1.

Based on the balance of evidence (magnitude and directness of predictors, and the integrated interpretations provided), Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (clinically disturbed), and PSQI correlates with PSS (r = 0.59).  
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55, which correlate moderately with PSS (PEG r ≈ 0.47; PAPAS r ≈ 0.50).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations during some late-night hours that are positively associated with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45; 2–3am r = 0.40).  
- Although there are protective wearable signals (strong circadian amplitude/autocorrelation, long objective sleep opportunity, consolidated daytime activation), the summary explicitly concludes these mitigate but do not outweigh the strong self-report predictors of higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (disturbed sleep), late median sleep start (~01:58 AM), and elevated sleep-duration variability — sleep complaints are associated with higher PSS.  
- Circadian/behavioral fragmentation: high intradaily variability (0.67, z ≈ 0.88), which correlates positively with PSS in this sample.  
- Elevated evening physiological arousal: pronounced HR deviations in the 6–9 PM window (z up to ≈ 2.9) that could reflect incomplete downregulation and relate to sleep problems and stress.  
- Low social engagement (z ≈ −1.41), which can reduce psychosocial buffering and be linked with greater perceived stress in some contexts.  
- However, the above risk features are offset by multiple robust protective signals (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem/happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, pronounced circadian amplitude and nocturnal HR dip) that the summary judges make P2’s PSS near or slightly below their study mean.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is framed relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 20.75; P2 mean = 21.62). P1 is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean; P2 is characterized as near to slightly below their population mean.  
- The intensity and predictive weight of P1’s risk signals are notable: anxiety and emotional lability have very large correlations with PSS in that dataset (particularly GAD-7 r = 0.80), and multiple self-report domains (sleep, affect, pain) coherently point upward. Wearable protections for P1 are moderate-to-strong but described as insufficient to reverse the self-report signal.  
- For P2, the primary risk signals are largely sleep-timing/fragmentation and low socializing; these are meaningful but more limited in scope and magnitude compared with P1’s strong affective and pain-related self-report predictors. Critically, P2 shows multiple strong protective indicators (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem/happiness, good exercise and physiological markers) that are strongly associated with lower PSS in that sample.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple strong, highly PSS-correlated self-report indicators pointing above their population mean, only partially offset by protective physiological rhythms.  
- Participant 2: some sleep/circadian risk signs but a broader set of strong protective psychological and physiological signals, concluding near/slightly below their population mean.

10,98760,10,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 9 (disturbed sleep), a variable that correlates positively with PSS and is a common contributor to perceived stress.
- Late and inconsistent sleep timing: median sleep-start ≈ 01:58 AM and elevated sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 102 min) can worsen daytime dysregulation and subjective stress.
- Elevated circadian fragmentation: intradaily variability = 0.67 (z ≈ 0.88), associated in this sample with higher PSS.
- Evening physiological arousal: large positive hourly heart-rate deviations in the 6–9 PM window (z up to ≈ 2.9) could reflect incomplete downregulation and contribute to stress/sleep problems.
- Low social engagement: short daily socializing time (z ≈ -1.41), which can reduce buffering resources and be associated with higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (also classified “Disturbed Sleep”), which has a moderate positive correlation with PSS.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate features: larger negative deviations 2–6 AM that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), suggesting a modest link to perceived stress for this individual.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both descriptions are written relative to very similar population means (21.62 vs 21.5), so relative placement comparisons are meaningful.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, large-magnitude protective signals that strongly predict lower PSS in that sample: maximal self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +1.79) with a strong negative NGSE–PSS correlation (r = -0.60), very low GAD-7 (z ≈ -1.38) with a strong positive GAD–PSS correlation (r = 0.75), very low resting heart rate (z ≈ -2.23), and high interdaily stability/amplitude (z ≈ +1.8 to +1.9). These features are highly weighted by the provided correlations and together produce a robust inference that Participant 2 is below their sample mean.
- Participant 1 has a mixture of risk and protective signals. Although they also report low depression/anxiety and good protective physiological markers (low RHR, high amplitude, exercise), the subjective sleep disturbance is more severe than Participant 2’s (PSQI 9 vs 7), sleep timing is later and more variable, intradaily variability is elevated, and socializing is low. The description explicitly concludes Participant 1 is near to slightly below the population mean rather than clearly below it.
- Weighing evidence: Participant 2’s profile shows stronger, convergent indicators of being below the mean (and relatively large effect sizes/correlations), while Participant 1’s profile contains more salient stress-related signals (poorer subjective sleep, fragmentation, low socializing) and less extreme protective scores than Participant 2. Thus Participant 1 is more likely to be closer to or above the population mean than Participant 2.

- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES‑D = 29 (z = 1.63) and STAI–Trait = 54 (z = 1.25). Both scales are positively correlated with PSS in this sample and are reported as strong indicators.  
- Poor subjective and objective sleep: PSQI = 10 (z = 1.52); short median sleep (6 h 15 min, z = -1.15) and high night‑to‑night variability (SD z = 1.52); frequent napping (mean naps/day z = 2.66). These sleep features are associated with higher PSS.  
- Physiological arousal / circadian dampening: Elevated resting heart rate (70.3 bpm, z = 1.44) and reduced cosinor amplitude (z = -0.47), both linked to higher PSS.  
- Low social / physical activity and poorer health satisfaction: Very low socializing (z = -2.2), minimal exercise (z ≈ -1.6–-1.9), high sedentary hobby time (z = 3.19), low health satisfaction (z = -1.61) — behavioral patterns often accompanying greater perceived stress.  
- Cross‑modal convergence: Multiple self‑report, wearable sleep, and cardiovascular indicators point in the same direction (above‑mean stress) for this study population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (as reported)
- Very elevated self‑reported anxiety: GAD‑7 = 18 (z = 1.51) and the GAD‑7 has a very large correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.74). This is described as the single strongest predictor of PSS for this participant.  
- Severe subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 18.5 (z = 1.65), and PSQI correlates substantially with PSS (r ≈ 0.43).  
- High emotional lability and pain/interference: BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability z = 1.03 (r ≈ 0.63 with PSS) and elevated PEG‑3/PAPAS scores, both associated with higher PSS.  
- Reduced perceived coping: Lower general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -0.44), and NGSE correlates strongly (negatively) with PSS in this sample.  
- Convergence of strong subjective predictors: Several of the participant’s top self‑report indicators are both elevated and have large correlations with PSS, which gives strong weight to an above‑mean PSS inference.

Comparative, within‑frame reasoning (each description is relative to its own cohort mean)
- Both participants are described as above their study population mean PSS. The key difference is the strength and predictive power of the elevated measures in each case.  
- Participant 1: many objective and subjective indicators point consistently above their study mean (depression, trait anxiety, poor subjective sleep, short/variable objective sleep, higher resting HR, low social/activity). However, the reported correlations between these measures and PSS in that dataset are modest (e.g., CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31; RHR and sleep variability r ≈ 0.14), so although multiple modalities converge, each individual predictor carries only modest predictive weight in that cohort.  
- Participant 2: fewer objective risk signals (many wearable/circadian features are protective), but the subjective measures that are elevated are the cohort’s strongest correlates of PSS — notably GAD‑7 (r ≈ 0.74) and Emotional Lability (r ≈ 0.63) — and PSQI is also highly elevated. That means the elevated scores for Participant 2 map to variables that are much more predictive of PSS in that cohort than the analogous predictors for Participant 1 are in their cohort.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 1 shows a broad, multimodal pattern of stress‑related signs (behavioral, physiological, and symptom measures) with modest correlations to PSS in their cohort. This gives good evidence of above‑mean perceived stress, but relies on multiple moderate predictors.  
- Participant 2 shows very strong elevations on the single most predictive subjective measures of PSS for their cohort (particularly GAD‑7 with r ≈ 0.74 and high PSQI), even though objective physiology appears relatively resilient. Because those subjective variables have large effect sizes (high correlations with PSS), they should carry more weight in predicting higher perceived stress within that study population.

Conclusion
- Given that Participant 2’s elevated measures map to much stronger PSS predictors in their cohort (especially severe GAD‑7 and high PSQI) and those subjective elevations are large, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES-D = 29 (z = 1.63) and STAI-Trait = 54 (z = 1.25). Both measures are positively correlated with PSS in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), making them solid indicators of above-mean perceived stress.
- Poor subjective and objective sleep: PSQI = 10 (z = 1.52), median nightly sleep ~6 h 15 min (z = -1.15), and high night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD z = 1.52). Sleep disturbance and variability are positively associated with PSS in this sample.
- Physiological arousal and circadian dampening: Elevated resting HR (70.3 bpm, z = 1.44) and reduced heart-rate amplitude (z = -0.47). Resting HR and dampened amplitude are positively/negatively associated with PSS in directions consistent with greater stress.
- Low social/physical activity and health satisfaction: Very low socializing (z = -2.2), minimal exercise, high sedentary hobby time (z = 3.19), and low health satisfaction (z = -1.61); these behavioral patterns often co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Convergent multimodal pattern: Multiple moderate indicators across self-report, behavior, and physiology point toward above-mean stress.

Countervailing factors for Participant 1 (reduce but do not negate above-mean inference)
- Relatively high 24-hour autocorrelation (z = 1.15) and near-mean interdaily stability; lower intradaily variability (z = -0.53) — these rhythmic regularity metrics are associated with lower PSS and may be protective.
- No alcohol/drug use and slightly higher self-reported happiness (z = 0.55), which can buffer perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Extremely severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (strongly correlated with PSS, r = 0.50); median nightly sleep ≈ 3 hours (extremely short) and very large night-to-night sleep-timing variability (SD = 401 min, z = 2.82). These sleep measures are both extreme relative to that study’s sample and strongly associated with higher PSS.
- Strong anxiety and affective instability signals: GAD-7 = 9 with very high correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.78); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated (z = 0.43, r ≈ 0.68). These have very strong relationships with PSS in this dataset.
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: BASIS-24 Substance Abuse (z = 1.75) and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — plausible contributors to elevated stress.
- Circadian instability: Low interdaily stability (z = -1.42), low amplitude (z = -1.10), and reduced autocorrelation (z = -0.68), which align with higher PSS.

Countervailing factors for Participant 2
- Very high general self-efficacy (NGSE = 40, z = 1.79) with a substantial negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.63), a strong protective factor that should reduce perceived stress relative to peers.
- Lower resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ -0.55 to -0.66), which do not indicate physiological hyperarousal and may reflect resilience/fitness.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means. However, the strength, extremity, and PSS-relevance of the indicators differ.
- Participant 1 shows multiple moderate-to-mildly-elevated risk signals (depressive and trait anxiety symptoms, poor sleep but ~6h median, elevated resting HR, low socializing). Correlations between those measures and PSS in their study are modest-to-moderate (e.g., CES-D/STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31; RHR/amplitude r ≈ 0.14–0.17). Protective factors exist but are weaker than the combined risk signals.
- Participant 2 shows several highly salient and extreme signals that have strong sample correlations with PSS: extremely short objective sleep (~3 hours median) and very high sleep-timing variability, high PSQI (r = 0.50), GAD-7 with very strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.78), and emotional lability (r ≈ 0.68). Substance problems add further risk. While Participant 2 has a notably strong protective factor (high self-efficacy, r = -0.63), the magnitude and direct relevance of the sleep and anxiety signals (both objectively extreme and strongly correlated with PSS) produce a large net signal toward above-mean perceived stress.
- In short, Participant 1’s deviations are meaningful but generally moderate; Participant 2’s deviations include several severe, highly PSS-associated indicators (especially sleep and anxiety) that are more extreme relative to their population and have larger correlations with PSS.

Overall judgement
- Considering severity, number of high-weight indicators, and the strength of their associations with PSS within each study, Participant 2’s multimodal profile is likely to correspond to a higher perceived stress score (i.e., a larger elevation above their study population mean) than Participant 1’s profile.

19,77711,28,17,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean = 21.63)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = 1.06). STAI has a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.32), so this is a meaningful upward pressure on PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, above clinical cutoff), which is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z = -1.43) and modestly low health satisfaction (Z = -0.62), psychosocial factors that co‑occur with greater perceived stress.
- Behavioral circadian features consistent with vulnerability: late sleep timing (~01:02 AM) and lower interdaily stability (Z = -0.57) that can increase stress or reduce resilience.
- Daytime heart‑rate peaks (midday HR deviations) that could reflect periods of physiological activation tied to stressors or demands.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (protective signals)
- Relatively low resting heart rate (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness / lower basal autonomic arousal.
- Low intradaily variability and reasonably preserved circadian amplitude (both near/above average), indicating limited within‑day fragmentation and some rhythm stability.
- Strong academic functioning, limited substance use, moderate socializing, and self‑reported happiness slightly above average — all buffering factors.
- Nighttime HR dips and preserved nocturnal recovery.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean = 20.75)
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16.5, Z = 1.0) and PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.47) — a strong contributor.
- Extreme objective sleep impairment: median nightly sleep 2 h 38 m (Z = -0.94), very late median sleep start (03:12 AM) and high night‑to‑night variability (SD 281 min, Z = 1.3) — severe short/irregular sleep strongly linked to elevated stress.
- Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (overnight HR deviations Z ≈ 1.17–1.59) with moderate correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38), indicating physiologic arousal during typical sleep hours.
- Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) combined with a very strong study correlation between anxiety measures and PSS (r ≈ 0.78) — this makes anxiety a particularly potent predictor of higher PSS for this cohort.
- Pain/interference (PAPAS) shows positive association with PSS (r ≈ 0.48), adding to stress burden.
- Circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability) consistent with dysregulation that co‑occurs with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective signals)
- Above‑average self‑efficacy (New GSE Z = 0.3) and a large negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.68), which is a strong protective factor.
- Low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 subscale Z = -0.97) which, given its positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.72), suggests better emotion regulation and buffering.
- Resting heart rate and some daytime HR features are not strongly indicative of higher stress (correlations small or mixed).

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective sample means, but the magnitude and number of high‑risk signals differ.
- Participant 1 shows moderate psychological risk (elevated trait anxiety, PSQI >5, low self‑esteem) but also several robust protective/neutral physiological and functional indicators (low RHR, less intraday fragmentation, strong academic functioning, some happiness). The overall inference for P1 was “slightly above the population mean” — a modest elevation.
- Participant 2 shows more severe and convergent high‑risk signals: very severe subjective and objective sleep loss/irregularity (extremely short median sleep, very late and variable sleep timing), nocturnal physiological arousal, moderate clinical anxiety in a sample where anxiety is very strongly linked to PSS, plus pain interference. Although P2 has notable protective traits (self‑efficacy and low emotional lability), the severity of sleep deprivation/physiologic nocturnal arousal and the strong anxiety→PSS relationship weigh more heavily toward higher perceived stress.
- Standardized effect sizes and correlation strengths favor Participant 2 as having the worse overall perceived stress: P2 shows larger negative Z on sleep duration, higher Zs for nocturnal HR deviations, and is situated in a context where anxiety correlates very strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.78). P1’s elevations are milder and more offset by physiological and functional resilience.

Conclusion
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse overall perceived stress).

  - Flattened/compressed diurnal HR pattern and short/fragmented sleep.
- Protective factors (mitigating but not fully offsetting):
  - High general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.41; r with PSS ≈ −0.68).
  - Low interpersonal problems and relatively low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.9 to −1.4).
- Net inference reported in the description: overall pattern most consistent with PSS above the population mean (mean = 21.04), because multiple high‑impact self‑report predictors of PSS are elevated.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study sample):
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity that in this cohort modestly associates with higher PSS:
  - Low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.07), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation, elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.74).
  - Attenuated HR rhythm amplitude (Z ≈ −1.03).
  - Some hourly HR deviations (early‑morning elevation, pronounced 6–7am peak Z = 3.07) that modestly correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.23).
- However, these physiological/circadian signals have only small‑to‑moderate associations with PSS in this sample and are the main+only risk indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (within their study sample):
- Multiple robust self‑report and behavioral indicators associated with lower perceived stress:
  - Low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = −1.71) and very low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 3).
  - High happiness, health satisfaction, and self‑esteem (Zs positive and large).
  - Good sleep quantity and quality (median ~8 h 11 m, PSQI = 5).
  - Frequent exercise, low substance use, low sedentary time.
  - Low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.65).
- Net inference reported in the description: overall pattern most consistent with PSS below the population mean (mean = 21.65).

Comparative reasoning (taking within‑sample frames into account):
- Participant 1’s elevated features are concentrated in measures that show moderate‑to‑strong correlations with PSS in their study (anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability). These are high‑impact predictors in that sample.
- Participant 2’s adverse signals are primarily wearable circadian irregularities that show only small‑to‑moderate associations with PSS; they are counterbalanced (and outweighed) by multiple strong self‑report and behavioral indicators of low stress (very low anxiety/depression, good sleep, high well‑being).
- Both descriptions explicitly conclude P1 ≈ above‑mean PSS for their cohort and P2 ≈ below‑mean PSS for their cohort. Given the relative strength and correlation magnitudes of P1’s risk signals versus P2’s predominantly protective self‑report profile (with only modest wearable risk signals), the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

Participant 2 shows only mild risk signals (modest sleep complaint, mild trait anxiety, late timing) but several robust protective signals (low depression, high subjective well-being, strong circadian regularity, low resting HR, regular exercise).  
- The effect sizes and direct PSS correlates in Participant 1 (notably anxiety and self-efficacy) are much larger than the risk signals observed for Participant 2, so the expected PSS deviation above mean is likely greater for Participant 1 than any upward deviation for Participant 2.

- Participant 2’s profile is explicitly judged to “lean toward lower perceived stress” relative to their sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.42, SD = 7.28).

These large-effect predictors favor lower PSS enough in the provided interpretation to outweigh the sleep-related risk.
- Comparing the magnitudes: Participant 2’s main risk (sleep restriction) is important, but the largest, most predictive signals (low anxiety and high self-efficacy with strong correlations to PSS) point toward below-mean PSS.

- Pain-related interference: PAPAS modestly elevated and correlates with PSS (r = 0.48), adding to stress burden.
- Circadian dysregulation: low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability consistent with shifted/unstable schedule, which is associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Countervailing but smaller protective factors: above-average self-efficacy (Z = 0.3) and low emotional lability (Z = -0.97) reduce likelihood of very high PSS but do not fully offset strong anxiety + severe sleep/nocturnal arousal signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Sleep/circadian disturbance: PSQI = 7 (>5), late median sleep start (~03:38), median sleep duration reduced (6 h 30 min, Z = -0.85), increased sleep-start variability (Z ≈ 0.88), reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.82) and increased intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.88). These metrics are modestly positively associated with PSS in the dataset (correlations around 0.16–0.18).
- Evening physiological arousal: large positive evening HR deviations (e.g., 7–8 pm Z ≈ 1.53) which map onto sleep/circadian disruption and can contribute to perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction and lower momentary happiness (health satisfaction Z = -1.53; current happiness Z = -0.53), which commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Protective/offsetting features: below-average trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI Z ≈ -0.33; CES-D Z ≈ -0.14), slightly higher self-esteem, regular exercise and social contact (z ≈ 1.1), and lower resting HR/MESOR (Zs ≈ -0.56, -0.7) suggesting better fitness and resilience—these reduce the likelihood of a high PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and predictive value of indicators: Participant 1’s moderate anxiety is a very strong predictor of PSS in that study (r ≈ 0.78), giving considerable weight toward above-mean PSS. Participant 2’s trait anxiety and depression are below-average, which is a protective signal in their study.
- Severity of sleep/physiological disturbance: Participant 1 shows far more severe sleep impairment (PSQI 16.5; median sleep ~2.6 hours) and nocturnal HR elevations concentrated during usual sleep hours—these are strong, convergent signals linked to higher PSS. Participant 2’s sleep/circadian problems are notable but substantially milder (PSQI 7; median sleep ~6.5 hours) and partially offset by fitness/lifestyle protections.
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s risk signals (highly predictive anxiety + very severe objective and subjective sleep disruption + nocturnal physiological arousal) outweigh their protective traits. Participant 2’s risk signals (circadian/sleep irregularity and evening arousal) are modest and are balanced or outweighed by multiple protective factors (lower trait anxiety/depression, exercise, socializing, good fitness markers).

Conclusion (which participant likely has the higher PSS)
- Based on the relative strength, severity, and predictive value of the stress-related indicators within each participant’s study frame, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.65), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +1.03; r with PSS = 0.63).
- Increased pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 elevated; PAPAS composite elevated), which correlate positively with PSS.
- Reduced perceived self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −0.44; NGSE r with PSS = −0.66), indicating fewer coping resources.
- Convergent pattern: multiple subjective measures that are both elevated and have relatively large correlations with PSS, producing a strong subjective signal for above‑mean perceived stress.
- Caveat: objective wearable metrics (low resting HR, good interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, clear cosinor amplitude) point toward physiological regularity/resilience, but these features have smaller correlations with PSS and are described as insufficient to outweigh the strong subjective signal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very high trait anxiety (STAI‑Trait = 62; Z ≈ +2.05), and elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 28; Z ≈ +1.53). Both are positively correlated with PSS but with only moderate correlations in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28).
- Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI Z ≈ +1.05) and low reported happiness (Z ≈ −1.61), consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Low self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ −1.57) and reduced social/leisure engagement — psychosocial patterns that accompany higher perceived stress.
- Some physiological indices suggest modestly increased arousal (resting HR Z ≈ +0.67; MESOR Z ≈ +0.56) and slight within‑day fragmentation (IV Z ≈ +0.10); these have small positive correlations with PSS.
- Caveats / protective factors: objectively adequate nightly sleep duration (Z ≈ +0.74), regular exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), modest circadian regularity (IS and 24‑h autocorr slightly above mean), and low substance misuse — these resilience features temper but do not eliminate the self‑report distress.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective study means.
- Strength of predictors matters because each description is relative to that cohort: Participant 1’s elevated measures include several variables that (in this sample) have relatively large correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.74, BASIS‑24 emotional lability r = 0.63, NGSE r = −0.66, PSQI r = 0.43). Those high‑correlation predictors are elevated concurrently, giving a strong, convergent signal that P1’s PSS is well above their cohort mean.
- Participant 2 shows very large z‑scores on trait anxiety and notable depressive symptoms (STAI Z ≈ +2.05, CES‑D Z ≈ +1.53), but those measures have only moderate correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28). Participant 2 also has several protective/mitigating features (good objective sleep duration, regular exercise, modest circadian regularity, low substance use) that likely reduce the net PSS elevation relative to peers.
- In short: P1’s elevated predictors are both numerous and, importantly, more tightly linked to PSS in their cohort, whereas P2’s markers—though substantial in magnitude for some scales—have weaker sample correlations and are partially offset by stronger behavioral/physiological resilience signals.

Net judgment
- Taking into account each description relative to its own population mean and weighting predictors by their sample correlations with PSS, Participant 1 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

3,35344,13,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Very high trait anxiety (STAI‑T = 62; Z ≈ +2.05) and elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 28; Z ≈ +1.53). Both measures have positive correlations with PSS in this sample and are pronounced relative to the population.
- Clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05) and low self‑reported happiness (Z ≈ −1.61), both consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Low self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ −1.57) and reduced social/leisure engagement, which are psychosocial features that often accompany elevated perceived stress.
- Modestly elevated resting HR and slight intradaily variability (Zs ≈ +0.56 to +0.67 and +0.10), indicating modestly increased autonomic arousal compatible with higher stress.
- The summary explicitly interprets the combined pattern as above the sample mean (and plausibly near/above the 75th percentile).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), and PSQI has a fairly strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), so this is a notable risk factor.
- Pain/activity interference (PEG/PAPAS) and interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal Z ≈ +1.54) are present and correlate moderately with PSS in this dataset, so they could elevate perceived stress.
- Elevated mesor and resting HR (Zs ≈ +1.16 and +1.22) may reflect higher basal arousal, which can accompany stress for some people.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or near‑mean) PSS
- High general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41) with a strong inverse correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.63); this is a powerful protective factor.
- Very strong circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability Z = +2.13, autocorrelation Z = +1.57, low intradaily variability Z = −1.05) and long objective sleep duration (~9 h 41 min, Z ≈ +1.47), both of which are associated with resilience and lower stress in this dataset.
- Low emotional lability (Z ≈ −0.67) and minimal substance problems (Z ≈ −1.62), further protective.
- Mild anxiety only (GAD‑7 = 5.5) — GAD‑7 is strongly correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.77), but the participant’s score is low, so it contributes little to increased PSS.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are large, clinically meaningful internalizing symptoms (very high trait anxiety and substantial depressive symptoms) and poor subjective sleep and affect. Several of these markers have established positive correlations with PSS in that sample and are large in magnitude (high Zs). Although there are some protective wearable/behavioral signs (adequate objective sleep duration, exercise, modest circadian regularity), they appear insufficient to offset the pronounced psychological risk indicators. The summary explicitly judges P1 as above the population mean (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), plausibly well above the mean.
- Participant 2 shows a mixture of risk and strong protective factors. The key protective signals (especially NGSE with a strong negative correlation to PSS and very high interdaily stability) are both large in magnitude and in statistical importance in this sample. The risk signals (PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain, modestly elevated resting HR) are real but comparatively smaller in their expected influence given the sample correlations and the participant’s mild anxiety. The summary judges P2 as near the sample mean or slightly below it (mean = 21.38, SD = 7.34).

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple, large-magnitude internalizing and subjective sleep/affect risk markers that are closely tied to PSS in this sample → strong indication of higher-than-mean perceived stress.
- Participant 2: notable risks (subjective sleep, pain, interpersonal strain) but strong, large protective factors (high NGSE, exceptional circadian regularity, objective long sleep) that are likely to keep perceived stress near or below the sample mean.

Conclusion
Given the within-sample context and magnitude of risk vs. protective indicators, Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Large elevations on depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 2.47) and trait anxiety (STAI Z = 2.05), both consistent with higher perceived stress in this sample.
- Elevated tonic cardiovascular activation (resting HR Z ≈ 1.34; mesor Z ≈ 1.49), providing physiological evidence of greater arousal/tension.
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI >5), and late median sleep onset (~1:52 AM), which can contribute to perceived stress.
- Some within‑day fragmentation (intradaily variability slightly above mean) that modestly correlates with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study sample)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, Z = 1.51) and GAD‑7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74) — a particularly powerful predictor.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 1.03) and pain/interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS elevated), both positively associated with PSS; emotional lability has a strong r = 0.63 with PSS.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) where NGSE correlates strongly negative with PSS (r = -0.66), indicating reduced coping resources.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Strength/weight of predictors: Participant 2’s top self‑report predictors are tightly linked to PSS in their cohort (GAD‑7 r = 0.74; emotional lability r = 0.63; NGSE r = -0.66). These high correlations mean moderate-to-large deviations on these measures should strongly predict elevated PSS within that sample. Participant 1’s strongest self‑report signals (CES‑D and STAI) are large in magnitude (high Zs) but in that cohort have more modest correlations with PSS (~0.28–0.31), so their impact on predicted PSS is weaker per unit change.
- Magnitude of symptom elevations: Participant 1 shows very large Zs for depression/anxiety (2.05–2.47), whereas Participant 2’s key symptom Zs are substantial but smaller (GAD‑7 Z ≈ 1.51, PSQI Z ≈ 1.65). However, because Participant 2’s measures have much stronger predictive relationships to PSS, their moderate Zs likely translate into larger predicted PSS differences than comparable Zs on less‑predictive measures.
- Physiological/objective data: Participant 1’s elevated resting HR/mesor supports higher perceived stress, while Participant 2’s wearable metrics (low resting HR, strong interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, good amplitude) point toward physiological resilience. These objective features favor Participant 1 being physiologically more stressed and Participant 2 being physiologically less stressed.
- Net balance: For Participant 1 the evidence is mixed but leans above‑mean largely due to very high depression/trait anxiety and elevated cardiac tone; for Participant 2 the evidence also leans above‑mean but is driven by subjective measures that are especially strongly predictive of PSS in that cohort. The stronger predictive weights of Participant 2’s self‑reports offset their objectively resilient physiology.

Weighing the overall evidence
- Because Participant 2’s elevated self‑report measures include the single strongest predictor of PSS in their sample (GAD‑7, r = 0.74) plus other strongly correlated scales (emotional lability, NGSE), the subjective signal for higher perceived stress in Participant 2 is comparatively more diagnostic within their cohort than Participant 1’s symptom signal is within theirs.
- Participant 1 shows larger absolute symptom Z‑scores and elevated cardiac tone, but the study‑level correlations tying those measures to PSS are more modest, and several protective behavioral/objective features (long sleep, regular rhythms, no substance use) partially moderate the inference.
- Therefore, on balance, Participant 2’s profile is more strongly indicative of a higher PSS score in their own sample than Participant 1’s profile is in theirs.

7,83566,15,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population):
- Strong subjective and objective sleep disturbance: very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min), high night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD z ≈ 0.89), disturbed PSQI (z = 0.67). PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53), so these sleep problems point toward higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity / dampened rhythm (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude, blunted HR amplitude), which commonly co-occurs with higher stress and with the participant’s fragmented sleep.
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = 2.34), a contextual risk factor that plausibly increases perceived stress even if it has only a weak correlation with PSS in the sample.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or not clearly elevated) PSS:
- Minimal current anxiety (GAD-7 z = -1.38) and low emotional lability (z = -1.27), both of which argue against high concurrent subjective distress.
- Low pain and low pain interference (PAPAS composite z ≈ -1.29).
- Near-average self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.07); in this sample self-efficacy strongly relates to lower PSS.
- Lower resting heart rate / MESOR (negative z’s), consistent with lower tonic sympathetic arousal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population):
- Large affective symptom elevations: CES-D = 37 (z = 2.47) and STAI = 62 (z = 2.05). These high z-scores on depression and trait anxiety are strong signals and these measures are positively correlated with PSS in the cohort.
- Low happiness and below-average self-esteem (notable negative z’s), consistent with greater perceived stress.
- Elevated tonic cardiovascular activation: resting HR z = 1.34 and mesor z = 1.49, which in this sample show modest positive associations with PSS.
- Subjective sleep impairment (PSQI z ≈ 0.59) and late sleep timing, which can accompany elevated stress even when objective sleep duration is long.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or mitigated) PSS:
- Long objective sleep duration (median ~8 h; z = 1.18) and low night-to-night variability (sleep SD z ≈ -0.82), which can be restorative and protective.
- Preserved circadian regularity (interdaily stability near mean, high 24-h autocorrelation z ≈ 0.90) and relatively consistent daily structure (no substance use, no naps, good academic performance), which can buffer functional impact of stress.

Comparative weighing (within each participant’s population frame):
- Magnitude of abnormality: Participant 2 shows larger and more cross-domain z-score elevations (depression z = 2.47, anxiety z = 2.05, HR/mesor z ≈ 1.3–1.5). Participant 1’s largest z’s are interpersonal strain (z = 2.34) and some sleep variability (z ≈ 0.89), but several strong protective indicators (low anxiety, low pain, low resting HR) counterbalance the sleep/circadian signals.
- Relevance to PSS: In both samples, affective symptoms (depression/anxiety) are directly associated with elevated PSS. Participant 2’s large affective elevations are therefore especially predictive of higher perceived stress. For Participant 1, the strongest stress-relevant signals are sleep/circadian disruption and interpersonal strain; sleep is strongly correlated with PSS in that sample, but other key symptom domains (anxiety, pain) are low.
- Convergence of evidence: Participant 2 has convergent affective, subjective-sleep, and physiological activation signals all pointing above the mean. Participant 1 has mixed signals (strong sleep/circadian risk but clear offsets in anxiety/pain/resting HR).

Conclusion:
Overall, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their population mean.

- The summary characterizes the participant as near the study mean for perceived stress with a slight tendency toward higher (population mean PSS = 21.62), rather than markedly elevated.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing of evidence
- Strength and specificity of stress signals: Participant 1 shows multiple large, stress‑relevant elevations with substantial effect sizes (severe GAD, high PSQI, high pain/interference, low self‑efficacy) and physiological nocturnal arousal. These features are strongly and directly linked to PSS in that sample (notably anxiety with r ≈ 0.75).
- Participant 2’s symptom elevations are generally more modest (smaller Zs for CES‑D and STAI) and the physiological/behavioral elevations (RHR/mesor) are mild‑to‑moderate. Several strong protective features (good PSQI, high interdaily stability and autocorrelation, low intradaily variability, no substance use, good academic performance) are prominent and described as strongly deviating in the protective direction.
- Participant 1’s very short sleep duration (~5 h), severe anxiety, and high nocturnal HR deviations represent more acute, convergent risk factors for higher perceived stress than Participant 2’s mixed, largely modest symptom elevations offset by substantial behavioral/circadian resilience.
- Both summaries explicitly place Participant 1 above that study’s mean PSS and Participant 2 near that study’s mean (with only slight tendency upward). Even allowing for different population means (20.62 vs 21.62), the internal evidence for elevated perceived stress is markedly stronger for Participant 1.

- Lower self‑esteem and lower self‑rated happiness/health (RSES Z ≈ −0.45; happiness Z ≈ −0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ −0.95), which are associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (RHR Z = +0.83; mesor Z = +1.32), a weak positive correlate of PSS (r ≈ 0.14), indicating somewhat higher tonic autonomic arousal.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16.0, Z = +0.83) and wearable evidence of very short/irregular sleep (median wearable sleep 1 h 44 min, Z = −1.24; start‑time SD ≈ 160 min). PSQI has a strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG‑3 Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.80), both showing moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), which would raise perceived stress.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal that align with sleep problems; certain night‑hour HR deviations show modest positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.42).

Protective/offsetting context to keep in mind (these reduce the net upward pressure): very low generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 Z = −1.2; GAD‑7–PSS r ≈ 0.75), low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z ≈ −1.17), higher self‑efficacy (NGSE r ≈ −0.68), good interpersonal functioning, regular circadian structure (intradaily variability Z = −1.35; interdaily stability/autocorr slightly positive), higher HR amplitude (Z = +1.38) and lower resting HR (Z = −1.02). These are fairly strong protective indicators.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are described as overall near their respective cohort means, with modest upward pushes. However, the strength of the upward predictors differs.
- Participant 1’s upward signals (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, slightly elevated RHR, late sleep timing) are modest in magnitude and the variables that most strongly predict PSS in that cohort (CES‑D/STAI) are only modestly elevated. Participant 1 also shows several strong protective signals (notably very high circadian regularity and good subjective sleep quality) that likely counterbalance those modest risk signals.
- Participant 2’s primary upward signals (high PSQI and elevated pain/interference) are both moderate‑to‑strong correlates of PSS in that cohort (r ≈ 0.52–0.58) and are meaningfully elevated (Z ≈ +0.7–0.8). Although Participant 2 also has strong protective traits (very low anxiety, high self‑efficacy, good circadian amplitude and low RHR), the combination of strongly predictive, elevated sleep disturbance and pain gives a clearer push toward higher perceived stress than the modest self‑report elevations seen for Participant 1.
- Measurement caveat: some of Participant 2’s wearable sleep metrics may be biased (non‑wear), but the elevated PSQI independently supports clinically relevant sleep problems, strengthening the inference of higher PSS for Participant 2.

Weighing the balance of evidence, Participant 2 shows the stronger net set of elevated predictors (sleep disturbance and pain) that have larger correlations with PSS in their sample, whereas Participant 1’s elevated indicators are weaker and are substantially offset by robust circadian and behavioral protections. Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit higher perceived stress.

- Pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55), which are positively associated with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50).
- Some nocturnal HR elevations during specific hours that, in this sample, are associated with higher PSS (hourly HR deviations with r ≈ 0.40–0.45).

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS (from the description)
- Markedly disrupted circadian/HR organization (circadian amplitude Z = -2.10, interdaily stability Z = -1.98, 24‑h autocorrelation Z = -1.62), indicating large objective rhythm disruption that in this sample associates with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate (77.6 bpm, Z = +2.31), a physiological correlate of stress.
- Objectively short sleep (median 6 hr 5 min, Z = -1.37), very late sleep onset (~02:34), and subjectively poor sleep (PSQI = 7).
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 20, Z ≈ +0.7), which correlate positively with PSS.
- Low behavioral resilience (very low exercise, limited socializing, low physical‑health satisfaction) and some alcohol use, which can co‑occur with higher perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both descriptions conclude the participant’s PSS is above their study’s population mean. But the strength and magnitude of the signals differ.
- Participant 1’s indicators of higher PSS are primarily self‑report (sleep disturbance, mild anxiety, emotional lability, pain). These self‑report measures have high correlations with PSS in that dataset (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.80 and PSQI r = 0.59), making them meaningful predictors. However, Participant 1 also shows substantial physiologic/behavioral protective signals relative to their peers (robust circadian amplitude and 24‑h autocorrelation: Z ≈ +0.9; long objective sleep Z = +1.64; consolidated daytime HR peaks). These protective Z‑scores are close to or above +1 SD and are associated with lower PSS in that sample, so they likely attenuate the net elevation in perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows multiple large magnitude objective deviations (resting HR Z = +2.31; circadian amplitude Z = -2.10; interdaily stability Z = -1.98) in addition to short/late sleep and elevated depressive symptoms. These are convergent signals across physiology, sleep, behavior, and mood, with several values > |2| SD from the sample mean—indicating more extreme dysregulation relative to peers. Although Participant 2 has some protective self‑report features (higher self‑esteem, lower trait anxiety, some happiness), these are smaller in magnitude and less consistent with the strong objective dysregulation.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: Above‑mean PSS is plausible driven by self‑report symptom burden, but the effect is likely moderated by robust physiological rhythms and long objective sleep—overall a mixed but moderate elevation above the population mean.
- Participant 2: Multiple, large‑magnitude, convergent indicators (objective circadian/HR disruption, elevated resting HR, poor/late sleep, depressive symptoms, behavioral risk factors) point to a stronger and more extreme elevation in perceived stress relative to that study’s population.

- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18; Z ≈ +1.49) and objective extreme sleep restriction (median sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min) with high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min) — sleep variables that strongly amplify perceived stress.
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 10; PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28) and marked emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42), both linked to higher PSS.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), which tends to increase perceived stress.
- Objective signs of circadian fragmentation (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability) and nighttime physiological arousal (evening/early-night HR deviations correlated with PSS), which align with the self-report picture.
- Although there are some protective signals (low substance-use problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), the number and magnitude of high-risk indicators (multiple Zs ≈ |2+|) point strongly toward a PSS substantially above their study mean (population mean = 20.33).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Trait anxiety modestly elevated (STAI Z ≈ +0.27) and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +0.59) — both positively associated with PSS.
- Markedly reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.56) and large sleep-timing variability (sleep-start SD Z ≈ +1.48), which are behavioral patterns associated with higher perceived stress.
- Some elevated evening/night HR deviations and modestly higher MESOR (Z ≈ +0.46), consistent with modestly elevated physiological tone.
- Lower momentary happiness and slightly reduced self-esteem, which correlate with higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower/only mildly elevated PSS (protective evidence)
- Adequate objective nocturnal sleep duration (median ≈ 8 h; Z ≈ +1.01) and low nap frequency (Z ≈ −0.86), favoring recovery.
- Regular participation in sports (Z ≈ +1.58), normal depressive symptom burden (CES-D Z ≈ 0), and typical resting HR — all buffers against high perceived stress.
- The self-report and wearable signals that point to stress are generally modest in magnitude (Zs mostly in the ±0.3–1.5 range), and the write-up characterizes the participant as mildly-to-moderately above their population mean (population mean = 21.6).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective study means. However, Participant 1’s risk indicators are larger in magnitude and more numerous: multiple high absolute Z-scores across anxiety, sleep, pain, emotional lability, and low self-efficacy (several ≈ |2+|), plus extreme objective sleep restriction (≈3 h 42 min), all of which are strongly linked to higher PSS in that sample. Participant 2’s elevated signals are generally smaller (Zs ≈ 0.3–1.5), and several substantial protective factors (8 h sleep, frequent sports, no elevated depressive symptoms) mitigate the net elevation in perceived stress.
- Although the population means differ slightly (P1 mean = 20.33; P2 mean = 21.6), the relative magnitudes of abnormality within each participant’s own sample are decisive: Participant 1 shows more extreme departures on multiple high-correlation predictors of PSS, implying a larger absolute PSS value relative to their peer distribution than Participant 2’s more modest elevation relative to theirs.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1’s profile indicates a stronger and more consistent set of risk signals for high perceived stress (severe anxiety, extreme objective and subjective sleep impairment, high pain/interference, emotional dysregulation, low self-efficacy). Participant 2 shows only mild-to-moderate risk signals that are substantially offset by protective behaviors and adequate sleep. Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to have the worse (higher) overall PSS.

- Very large objective sleep restriction: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 30 min (very extreme deviation) and highly delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:37 AM). Short, severely curtailed sleep is strongly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5) — PSQI has a substantial positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43), with pain measures showing moderate positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal elevations in heart rate (hourly Z up to ≈ 0.67 late night/early morning) and reduced circadian robustness (reduced amplitude, lower 24‑h autocorrelation) — these wearable signals in this sample are linked to higher PSS.
- Convergence of multiple objective and subjective risk signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal physiological arousal) that are moderate-to-strong PSS correlates in the cohort.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z ≈ +0.27) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8, Z ≈ +0.59), both positively associated with PSS.
- Large circadian/behavioral irregularity: markedly low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.56) and high sleep-start variability (Z ≈ +1.48), patterns associated with higher perceived stress in this dataset.
- Some evening/nighttime heart-rate elevations and a modestly elevated MESOR (Z ≈ +0.46) that can reflect higher overall cardiovascular tone associated with stress.
- Reduced momentary happiness and slightly lower self‑esteem (small negative Z’s) which, at the population level, align with higher stress.

Comparative reasoning (taking the within-population frames into account)
- Both participants are assessed as likely above their respective population means. The question is which shows evidence of a larger elevation relative to their cohort-specific norms.
- Participant 1 presents several very large, convergent risk signals that are strong PSS correlates in that sample: extremely short objective sleep (≈3.5 h), clinically disturbed subjective sleep, elevated pain (PEG Z ≈ +1.33), and nocturnal HR elevations. These objective/behavioral abnormalities are severe in magnitude and point toward substantive perceived stress even though some self-report protectors (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy) are present.
- Participant 2 shows a cluster of risk signals (moderate trait anxiety, PSQI above cutoff, marked circadian irregularity) but also has substantial protective factors: long total sleep time (8 h, Z ≈ +1.01), frequent sports participation (Z ≈ +1.58), normal depressive symptoms, and typical resting HR. The risk signals for Participant 2 are generally moderate or behavioral/regularity-based rather than the extreme sleep deprivation and pain seen for Participant 1.
- The magnitude and clinical severity of Participant 1’s sleep restriction and pain (both strongly linked to PSS) are more extreme than the primary risk indicators for Participant 2. Although Participant 1 has strong protective self-report markers (low anxiety, high self-efficacy) that reduce certainty, the objective severity of sleep/pain/arousal abnormalities likely produce a larger net elevation in perceived stress relative to that cohort’s mean than the more mixed/milder elevation seen for Participant 2.

Overall judgment
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (greater elevation above their study population mean), with moderate-to-high confidence given the extreme objective sleep restriction, elevated pain, and nocturnal physiological arousal versus Participant 2’s more moderate risk profile tempered by strong protective factors.

13,67106,28,18,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), which is above the common clinical threshold and is modestly associated with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Shorter nightly sleep (median ~6 h 46 min; Z = −0.51) and late, variable sleep onset (median ~01:29 AM; SD ≈ 88 min) — these sleep timing/quantity issues can increase stress vulnerability.
- Very low frequency of exercise and minimal socializing, behavioral risk factors for poorer stress management (though their direct correlations with PSS in this sample are small).
- Some evening heart-rate elevations (6–9 PM) that are above average, which could modestly relate to stress-related arousal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Substantially poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9) with a strong positive correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.59).
- Elevated anxiety and emotional lability (GAD-7 = 7.5; BASIS-24 Emotional Lability = 6.33) with very strong correlations to PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.80; emotional lability r = 0.67) — these are among the strongest survey predictors of higher PSS in the dataset.
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) with moderate positive correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).
- Nighttime heart-rate elevations during some nocturnal hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with sleep/arousal-related stress signals.
- Although Participant 2 has protective physiology (robust circadian amplitude/autocorrelation and consolidated daytime activation), the strongest, most predictive self-report indicators point toward elevated perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is already framed relative to its own study population: Participant 1 is characterized as likely below their population mean (21.62) and Participant 2 as likely above theirs (20.75).
- The weight of evidence for Participant 1 is dominantly protective (very low depression/anxiety, high interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation, low symptom burden), with only modest, lower-weight signals pushing stress up (PSQI just over threshold, late sleep, low exercise/socializing).
- For Participant 2, multiple high-weight, strongly PSS-correlated self-report measures (anxiety, emotional lability, poor subjective sleep, pain interference) coherently indicate higher perceived stress; wearable-derived protections moderate but do not outweigh those strong predictors.
- Given the relative strength and number of PSS-associated risk signals in Participant 2 versus the largely protective profile of Participant 1 (where risk signals are weaker/modest), Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Very high self-esteem and above-average happiness (Z ≈ +0.11 and +0.55), regular exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.61), low recreational drug use, and moderate alcohol — all factors that correlate with lower PSS in the sample.

- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29), which typically amplifies perceived stress.  
- Wearable-derived indicators of circadian fragmentation and dampened HR rhythm (intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.15; amplitude/mesor Z ≈ -0.9 to -1.14) and nocturnal HR deviations that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51).

Moderating/protective features for Participant 2:
- Low substance-use problems (Z ≈ -1.62), preserved interpersonal functioning (Z ≈ -1.07), and relatively low resting HR (Z ≈ -0.93). These may buffer function but do not offset the multiple severe risk indicators.

Net assessment within-sample: multiple, large-magnitude signalers (Zs often >2) that are strongly tied to PSS; the pattern points to a substantial elevation above the population mean.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame):
- Magnitude: Participant 2 exhibits far larger standardized deviations on core risk variables (e.g., anxiety, pain/interference, emotional lability, very short sleep) than Participant 1’s deviations (mostly Zs ≈ 0.8–1.3).  
- Direct PSS correlations: Participant 2’s strongest indicators (GAD-7, PSQI) have larger sample correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71, PSQI r ≈ 0.41) than Participant 1’s strongest indicators (CES-D/STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Coherence: Participant 2’s self-report and wearable data consistently align toward severe dysregulation (sleep restriction, circadian fragmentation, nocturnal arousal), whereas Participant 1’s dataset is mixed (clinical mood/sleep signals present but offset by several protective factors).  
- Therefore, relative to their own study means, Participant 2 is likely to be farther above their population’s average PSS than Participant 1 is above theirs.

- Strong anxiety signal: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) and in this sample GAD-7 has a very large positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).  
- Severe objective sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 and median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 19 m (Z = -1.04) with very late/variable sleep onset (start-time SD Z = 1.16) — extreme sleep loss and variability are tightly linked to higher PSS.  
- Physiological arousal and circadian disruption: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm, Z = 1.67), low circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), and marked nocturnal HR elevations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Elevated mood/anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 24 (Z = 1.11, “depressed”) and STAI = 50 (Z = 0.86); both have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Sleep disturbance and irregularity: PSQI = 7, late median sleep (~01:44) and high night-to-night variability (SD Z = 1.32).  
- Reduced circadian robustness: interdaily stability, amplitude, and 24-h autocorrelation are below average (Zs ≈ -0.5 to -0.7), which is associated with higher stress.  
- Social/health vulnerabilities: low trust (Z = -1.74) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95) could increase stress risk.  
- Net: meaningful psychosocial symptom elevations and circadian/sleep disruption that point toward higher PSS, but generally less extreme physiological derangement than Participant 1.

Comparative, within-population weighing
- Magnitude and specificity of predictors: Participant 1 shows several large-magnitude, convergent indicators (extremely short objective sleep, high resting HR, large circadian flattening, strong anxiety measure that in this sample is very tightly correlated with PSS). Those indicators are both severe and, in this dataset, strongly linked to PSS (notably the very high GAD-7 correlation and nocturnal HR–PSS associations).  
- Participant 2 shows clear signals of elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms and circadian/sleep irregularity, but many of these signals are of more moderate magnitude (Zs ~0.8–1.1) and several robust protective factors are present (regular exercise, low resting HR, high self-esteem and positive affect) that likely attenuate perceived stress.  
- Overall, Participant 1’s profile contains more extreme objective physiological and sleep abnormalities that, in this cohort, map strongly onto higher PSS; Participant 2’s profile is elevated but more moderate and balanced by notable protective factors.

- Nocturnal autonomic arousal (large overnight HR deviations, e.g., +11.92 bpm at 12–1am, z ≈ 1.02) that positively correlate with PSS.
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) with a strong negative association with PSS (≈ −0.66), consistent with greater perceived stress vulnerability.
- Elevated substance‑use subscale (BASIS‑24 substance z ≈ 1.5), a possible stress‑relevant behavioral marker.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Modestly elevated resting heart rate (RHR = 62.8 bpm; z = 0.55) with a small positive RHR–PSS correlation (≈ 0.14).
- Slightly lower momentary happiness (current happiness z ≈ −0.53), which could reflect transient negative affect (happiness ↔ PSS r ≈ −0.19).
- Low reported physical activity/exercise frequency (behavioral risk factor, though weakly correlated with PSS in this sample).

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each summary is expressed relative to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is characterized as above their cohort mean (population mean PSS = 20.67); Participant 2 is characterized as below their cohort mean (population mean PSS = 21.62).
- The magnitude and predictive relevance of Participant 1’s adverse signals are substantial: GAD‑7 has a very large correlation with PSS (≈0.77) and is clinically meaningful; PSQI is highly elevated (z = 1.32) and also linked to PSS. Nocturnal HR elevations additionally converge with those psychological signals.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, consistent protective indicators (very low depressive and trait anxiety scores, high self‑esteem, excellent subjective sleep, long/regular objective sleep, robust circadian metrics with multiple z > 1), which collectively point toward lower perceived stress relative to their cohort. The few stress‑consistent signals for Participant 2 are small in magnitude and weakly related to PSS in this sample.
- Overall, the high‑impact, strongly PSS‑related elevations in Participant 1 (especially anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance) outweigh Participant 2’s minor elevations in RHR or transient negative affect. Even though Participant 2’s cohort mean PSS is slightly higher (21.62 vs 20.67), the profiles indicate Participant 1 is more likely to be experiencing higher perceived stress relative to their cohort than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

- Severe sleep disturbance: high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and very short objective sleep (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 27 m). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.46), so these sleep problems are meaningful predictors of higher perceived stress.
- Fragmented circadian/rest‑activity patterns: very high intradaily variability (IV Z = 2.29) and elevated sleep‑duration variability and naps (sleep SD and naps Zs positive). IV shows a positive (though smaller) association with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.24).
- Some interpersonal strain: elevated BASIS‑24 interpersonal relationships subscale (Z ≈ 0.94), which could contribute to stress even if that subscale has only a small sample correlation with PSS.
- Even though other indicators point the other way, these multiple sleep‑related risk factors (especially severe objective short sleep) are potent contributors to perceived stress and could raise PSS relative to peers.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Mild physiological and affective signals in the higher‑stress direction: resting heart rate modestly above the mean (RHR Z ≈ 0.55; RHR–PSS correlation ≈ 0.14) and somewhat lower momentary happiness (Z ≈ −0.53).
- Low habitual physical activity (low exercise/sports frequency), a weaker behavioral risk factor for higher stress in this sample.
- These risk signals are relatively small in magnitude and fewer in number than the protective signals, so they are limited reasons to infer higher PSS.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own cohort mean PSS. Participant 1’s profile is mixed but flagged by several strong sleep‑related indicators that are meaningfully associated with higher PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.46; objective severe sleep restriction). Although Participant 1 also has strong predictors of lower PSS (very low GAD‑7, high self‑efficacy and low emotional lability; GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.76, NGSE r ≈ −0.65), those protective signals do not remove the presence of extreme sleep pathology that—in absolute terms—is a strong risk for elevated stress.
- Participant 2 shows a convergent multimodal pattern of low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem, very good subjective and objective sleep (median ≈ 8 h 42 m, robust circadian metrics), and only minor physiological/behavioral risks. Many of these protective measures have moderate sample correlations with lower PSS and are consistent across domains (self‑report + wearables).
- Comparing the two: Participant 2’s signals are consistently protective and robust across domains, whereas Participant 1 has at least one domain with severe risk (sleep) despite several protective indicators. The overall balance places Participant 1 at higher relative perceived stress than Participant 2.

- Late habitual sleep timing (median start ~02:45) and very low physical activity (exercise z ≈ -1.6 to -1.9), both of which are risk factors for higher perceived stress.  
- Contextual stressors: declining GPA trend and low self-esteem (Rosenberg z ≈ -1.43) that can increase perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Magnitude of stress-linked signals: Participant 1 shows a very large subjective-sleep deviation (PSQI z ≈ +1.32) and multiple nocturnal HR elevations (z up to ≈ +1.02). Participant 2’s largest risk markers are STAI z ≈ +0.96 and PSQI z ≈ +0.59. On raw z-magnitude for sleep disturbance, Participant 1’s PSQI is substantially higher than Participant 2’s.  
- Strength of predictive associations to PSS: In Participant 1’s dataset, GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so even a moderate GAD-7 elevation is highly informative. In Participant 2’s dataset, STAI correlates with PSS more weakly (r ≈ 0.31), so the same or larger z-score on anxiety is less predictive of higher PSS. Nocturnal HR deviations in Participant 1 also positively correlate with PSS; Participant 2’s wearable physiology is dominated by protective circadian features (high interdaily stability and amplitude) that are negatively correlated with PSS.  
- Protective vs. risk balance: Participant 1 has several high-impact risk signals (GAD-7, very poor PSQI, nocturnal HR elevations, lower self-efficacy) that outweigh their protective signs. Participant 2 has important risk signals (trait anxiety, short sleep, late timing, low exercise), but also strong protective circadian stability and amplitude, low depressive symptoms, and lower substance use, leading to an overall profile closer to the population mean (the description said “near—but likely slightly above—the mean”).

Overall judgment
- On balance, Participant 1’s profile provides stronger and more directly PSS-linked evidence of elevated perceived stress relative to their sample mean than Participant 2’s profile does relative to theirs. Participant 2’s elevated measures are partially offset by robust protective circadian physiology and low depression/substance indicators, yielding a near-mean stress inference. Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse perceived stress).

- The summary concludes the participant’s PSS is near but likely slightly above the population mean.

Relative-frame considerations (each description is relative to its own population mean)
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as having perceived stress below the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.5). The strongest signals for that placement are very high self-efficacy (NGSE max, Z ≈ +1.79) and very low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ -1.38), both strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (NGSE–PSS r ≈ -0.60; GAD–PSS r ≈ +0.75).
- Participant 2 is characterized as near or slightly above the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.62), with trait anxiety and sleep disturbance cited as the primary contributors to that relative elevation despite several protective circadian markers.
- The two population means are almost identical (21.5 vs 21.62), so comparing relative positions to their respective means is a fair basis for deciding which participant exhibits the worse perceived stress in their cohort.

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 1: strong, high-weight signals favor lower-than-mean stress (extremely high self-efficacy; very low GAD-7; low interpersonal/substance problems; robust circadian regularity and very low RHR). The countervailing signals (PSQI disturbance; some nocturnal HR associations) are moderate-to-small in effect size and fewer in number.
- Participant 2: a mixed profile but with several meaningful risk signals (elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, short sleep duration, late timing, low exercise, low self-esteem) that together are likely to push PSS to at-or-above-mean. Protective signals (high interdaily stability and amplitude, low depressive symptoms, low substance use) mitigate but do not fully counterbalance the anxiety + sleep-related risk indicators according to the summary.
- Given P1 is described as below-mean and P2 as near/slightly above-mean (and considering the relative strengths and correlations of the reported measures), Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their peers.

- Circadian/physiological signs linked to stress: higher intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.60), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.72), and pronounced daytime HR elevations — these correlate with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Reduced reported happiness and less socializing (negative Zs) that can exacerbate perceived stress.
- Although some protective features exist (regular exercise, low resting HR, adequate objective sleep, modest interdaily stability), the net summary in the description is a modest tilt above the population mean.

- Pain and activity interference (PEG/PAPAS) above median and interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54), which can elevate perceived stress.
- Elevated mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22) suggesting higher basal autonomic arousal (though correlations with PSS are weak).
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5) — positive relation to PSS, but small here.
- However, several very strong protective factors are described (high general self-efficacy NGSE Z = 1.41 with a strong inverse correlation to PSS; very high interdaily stability and autocorrelation; low intradaily variability; emotional stability; long objective sleep), and the integrated interpretation explicitly favors near-to-below-mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both summaries state the participants are near their respective sample means, but Participant 1 is characterized as ""modestly elevated above the population mean"" while Participant 2 is characterized as ""near the mean, likely at or slightly below"" because protective factors (especially NGSE and very strong circadian regularity) outweigh Participant 2’s risk signals.
- Participant 1’s risk signals (subjective sleep problems, anxiety-related self-report, circadian fragmentation and daytime HR spikes) are more directly tied to PSS in this dataset and are interpreted in the summary as producing a modest upward tilt relative to that study’s mean.
- Participant 2 has some clear risk features (poor PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain) but also unusually strong, strongly correlated protective factors (high NGSE, very stable circadian rhythms, low emotional lability) that the summary judges to outweigh the risks.

Weighted judgment
- On balance, Participant 1’s profile is more consistent with a higher inferred PSS relative to their study population mean, whereas Participant 2’s strong protective signals make them more likely to be at-or-below their study mean.

8,67192,20,31,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: High depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 32; Z ≈ 1.95) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z ≈ 1.65). Both are positively associated with PSS in this study (r ≈ 0.27 and 0.31) and are the strongest psychological signals in this profile.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), late sleep timing (~01:15 AM) with large night‑to‑night variability; sleep variability measures correlate positively with PSS in the sample.
- Elevated baseline/evening physiology: High mesor (Z = 2.01) and higher resting HR (Z = 1.62) with pronounced evening HR elevations—physiological signs consistent with greater tonic/arousal that support higher perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction and low BMI: Very low self‑rated health satisfaction (Z = −2.03) and underweight BMI (17.8) add to an overall distress signal, even if weakly correlated with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not have a markedly higher PSS (mitigating evidence)
- Objective sleep duration adequate (~7h16m; Z ≈ 0.10) and limited napping, which can buffer stress effects.
- Strong circadian regularity and activity structure (interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.91; 24‑h autocorr Z ≈ 1.23; IV not elevated) —these metrics are associated with lower PSS in this sample.
- Robust social engagement (Z ≈ 2.53) and low substance use, which likely mitigate perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly correlated psychological predictors: GAD‑7 = 8 (r with PSS = 0.77), elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24, r = 0.66), and low self‑efficacy (NGSE r = −0.65). These measures have the largest reported correlations with PSS in that study and point strongly toward higher perceived stress.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13 (r with PSS = 0.49) indicating severe perceived sleep problems.
- Objective severe sleep disruption: Extremely short median nightly sleep (1 h 39 m; Z ≈ −1.27) and very late median sleep onset (~04:36 AM) plus napping—objective signs consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and stress (noting possible device/artifact caveat).
- Circadian and physiological dysregulation: Elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.19–1.24), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ −1.05), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.07), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.46), and pronounced early‑morning HR elevations (hours with Z > 1). These converge with self‑report to indicate blunted day–night rhythm and nocturnal hyperarousal associated with higher PSS.
- Pain/interference (PEG‑3) and emotional dysregulation also contribute (PEG r ≈ 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have a markedly higher PSS (mitigating evidence)
- GAD‑7 is in the mild range (not severe).
- Low substance‑abuse score (Z ≈ −0.86) and some residual self‑efficacy (NGSE not extremely low).
- Some wearable‑to‑PSS correlations are mixed or weak for certain hours of the day.

Comparative weighing (taking into account each profile is relative to its own study mean)
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s top self‑report predictors (GAD‑7, emotional lability, self‑efficacy) have very large reported correlations with PSS (up to r = 0.77). Participant 1’s strongest psychological signals (CES‑D, STAI) are elevated but have substantially smaller correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.27–0.31). Thus, deviations in Participant 2 map more directly and strongly to higher PSS within that study’s correlational structure.
- Multimodal convergence: Participant 2 shows concordant, high‑impact signals across multiple domains (strongly correlated self‑report measures, objectively extremely short/late sleep, circadian blunting, nocturnal HR elevations). Participant 1 has elevated psychological symptoms and elevated cardiac tone, but also several protective/contradictory signals (adequate objective sleep duration, strong circadian regularity, high social engagement) that materially weaken the case for very high PSS.
- Magnitude and extremity of objective disturbance: Participant 2’s objective sleep pattern (very short median sleep, very late onset) and reduced amplitude/increased fragmentation are more extreme and more directly tied to higher PSS in that study than Participant 1’s physiological elevations, which have smaller PSS correlations.
- Population mean baselines are similar (21.59 vs 21.08) so the small difference in means does not change the above comparative judgment.

Conclusion
Taken together, Participant 2 has stronger, more highly correlated self‑report predictors of PSS and more extreme, convergent wearable indicators of circadian and sleep disruption that align with higher perceived stress in their study. Participant 1 shows meaningful signals of elevated distress but also several mitigating factors and generally weaker PSS correlations. Therefore Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

24,17569,33,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.61)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), a metric positively associated with PSS in the cohort.
- Objectively short sleep duration (median 5 h 44 m; Z ≈ -1.81), a robust stress-related risk factor for increased perceived stress.
- Mildly elevated intradaily HR variability (Z ≈ 0.46), which correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16) and suggests within-day fragmentation.
- Lower current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), which negatively correlates with PSS and thus aligns with higher perceived stress.
Notes: these risk signals are present but effect sizes/correlations in this sample are small-to-moderate; several stronger protective indicators offset them.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 20.54)
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51) with a very large positive correlation to PSS (r = 0.74) — the single strongest predictor in the dataset.
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5; Z ≈ 1.65) with a moderate positive correlation to PSS (r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24; Z ≈ 1.03) strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.63).
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS composite), which correlate positively with PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (r ≈ -0.66), indicating reduced coping resources.
Notes: these subjective measures have large effect sizes and converge consistently toward higher perceived stress. Objective circadian/HR markers are relatively organized and protective but have smaller predictive weight here.

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame
- Participant 1: The risk indicators (poor subjective sleep, short objective sleep, some intraday fragmentation) exist but are relatively modest in magnitude and are counterbalanced by multiple protective features (lower trait mood/anxiety, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction, high interdaily stability and amplitude, low resting HR). Correlations of the risk features with PSS are relatively small. The summary explicitly concludes PSS near-to-or-slightly-below the sample mean (21.61).
- Participant 2: Several large, convergent subjective predictors (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, pain, low self-efficacy) point clearly to PSS above the sample mean (20.54). Critically, the strongest predictors (GAD-7, emotional lability, NGSE) have large correlations with PSS in this cohort, so their influence outweighs the protective objective circadian/HR markers, which have smaller or mixed associations.

Balance of evidence and decision
- The evidence for elevated PSS is substantially stronger for Participant 2 than for Participant 1. Participant 2 has multiple high-magnitude, convergent subjective predictors with large correlations to PSS, whereas Participant 1’s stress-relevant risks are fewer, smaller in effect, and counterbalanced by several protective psychosocial and circadian features.
- Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Very severe and irregular sleep: PSQI = 13.5 (disturbed), objective median sleep ≈ 3 h 4 m, very large night-to-night timing variability (Z = 2.82). These sleep measures are strongly correlated with PSS in the sample and are extreme relative to that population.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 (and GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS, r = 0.78); BASIS-24 Emotional Lability elevated and strongly correlated with PSS (r = 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: Substance Abuse subscale high (Z = 1.75) and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS.
- Circadian instability: low interdaily stability and low amplitude (Zs = -1.42, -1.10) consistent with higher stress in the sample.
- Convergent strong signals: several of the above features both objectively measured and subjectively reported and each has substantial positive correlations with PSS in this cohort, giving them considerable inferential weight.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (based on their study-relative profile)
- Subjective sleep disturbance and objectively short sleep: PSQI = 8 (disturbed) and median sleep ≈ 5 h 44 m (Z = -1.81), which are known correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Some intradaily variability (heart-rate IV Z ≈ 0.46) and slightly lower current happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), which modestly align with higher PSS in this sample.
- These risk signs exist but are less extreme and have smaller correlations with PSS in the cohort than the strongest predictors seen for Participant 1.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and extremity of signals: Participant 1 shows multiple very strong, convergent risk indicators (extremely short sleep objectively + very high PSQI, strong anxiety measure with a high PSS correlation, elevated emotional lability, substance problems). Many of these measures have large correlations with PSS in that study, so their combined effect is likely to push inferred PSS well above that study’s mean.
- Participant 2 presents a mixed profile: notable but less extreme sleep shortness/disturbance is the main risk; however, robust protective features dominate (low trait anxiety/depression, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, strong interdaily stability and circadian amplitude, low resting HR). The study notes correlations are generally small-to-moderate and that protective factors outweigh the sleep-related risks, yielding an inferred PSS near or slightly below that study’s mean.
- Relative magnitudes and correlation strengths favor Participant 1 as having the worse (higher) perceived stress when reasoning within each participant’s own population context.

19,88882,28,18,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their study-relative profile)
- Strong predictors of higher PSS in this sample are present:
  - Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and GAD-7 → PSS correlation r = 0.78 (a very strong predictor).
  - Very pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16.5) and objective severe short/irregular sleep (median sleep 2 h 38 m; very late and highly variable sleep onset). PSQI → PSS correlation r = 0.47 (meaningful contribution).
  - Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., +13.5 bpm at 1–2 AM) and circadian disruption; overnight HR elevations correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
  - Pain-related interference (PAPAS elevated) with a positive correlation to PSS (r = 0.48).
- Countervailing factors (that could reduce PSS) include above-average self-efficacy (negative correlation with PSS, r = -0.68) and low emotional lability (also strongly correlated with lower PSS). However, the strongest correlates with PSS (anxiety and severe sleep disturbance with nocturnal arousal) point toward above-mean perceived stress in this participant’s population.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their study-relative profile)
- Sleep- and circadian-related risk signals:
  - Short sleep (median ~5 h 57 m; Z = -1.53) and PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep); short/poor sleep commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.
  - Delayed sleep timing and circadian irregularity (reduced interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability, low 24 h autocorrelation). Some wearable metrics (e.g., intradaily variability) show modest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset.
  - Evening heart-rate elevations that could reflect later-day arousal aligned with delayed sleep onset.
- Strong protective/low-stress signals that argue against high PSS:
  - Low trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ -1.31) and minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ -1.18); these psychological measures are robustly associated with lower PSS.
  - High happiness and self-esteem, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate (Z ≈ -1.28), healthy behaviors and minimal substance use — all linked to lower perceived stress in the sample.
- Holistically, although sleep/circadian markers are risk factors, the strong negative z-scores on trait anxiety/mood and positive lifestyle/fitness markers make a high PSS less likely; the study-level inference was “near or modestly below” the population mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame
- Participant 1’s profile includes multiple high-weight predictors of elevated PSS in their study (notably GAD-7 with r = 0.78, severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance, and nocturnal physiological arousal). The summary explicitly concludes “likely above the population mean” (mean = 20.75).
- Participant 2’s profile is mixed but dominated by strong protective psychometric and behavioral indicators (low anxiety/depression, high happiness/self-esteem, exercise, low RHR). The wearable sleep/circadian risks are notable but are described as less determinative given the effect sizes; the summary infers “near the mean” or slightly below (mean = 21.62).
- Both participants’ population means are similar (20.75 vs 21.62), so the relative within-sample inferences are directly comparable: P1 is inferred above their study mean, P2 is inferred near or slightly below theirs.

Overall balance of evidence and decision
- Participant 1 exhibits stronger, high-weight signals consistently associated with higher perceived stress (especially moderate clinical anxiety and extreme sleep disturbance with nocturnal arousal) despite some protective traits.
- Participant 2 shows sleep-related risk but stronger and multiple protective psychological and behavioral indicators; the summary explicitly leans toward near/below-mean PSS.
- Therefore Participant 1 is the more likely to have the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) when comparing the two participants in their respective study-relative frames.

- Very high subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 14 (Z = +3.37), a large outlier that is strongly associated with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Objective sleep irregularity and variability: sleep-duration SD Z ≈ +1.55 and sleep start-time SD Z ≈ +1.19, plus reduced interdaily stability and autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.74 to -1.29). These circadian irregularities modestly correlate with higher PSS.
- Low physical activity (exercise-frequency Z ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and somewhat higher alcohol use (Z ≈ +1.0), behaviors that can co-occur with elevated perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ +1.51), a feature that correlates very strongly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75) and is a major driver of elevated perceived stress.
- Substantial subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83), which correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- High pain and activity interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ +1.4–1.6, which positively correlate with PSS.
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -1.73 (NGSE correlates negatively with PSS, r ≈ -0.61), indicating reduced coping resources.
- Objective signs of nocturnal hyperarousal and very short sleep: large positive nocturnal HR deviations (some hourly Zs up to ≈ +2.83), late sleep onset (~01:42), and short median sleep (~4 h 55 min) — physiological and behavioral patterns consistent with elevated perceived stress.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both descriptions conclude the participant is above their study’s PSS mean, but the strength, number, and effect sizes of indicators differ.
- Participant 1’s elevation is driven mainly by a single very strong indicator (extreme subjective sleep disturbance and some objective irregularity), while other psychological measures (depression, trait anxiety, self-esteem, happiness) are near or better than the cohort mean and provide substantial counter-evidence.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, concordant strong stress signals across domains: severe anxiety (a very strong correlate of PSS), poor subjective sleep, pain/interference, low self-efficacy, plus physiological nocturnal arousal and very short sleep. Several of these measures have large correlations with PSS in the cohort, and they cluster coherently to produce a robust high-stress profile. Although Participant 2 has some protective circadian regularity features, these appear to be partial mitigators rather than dominant signals.
- In short: Participant 1 is likely only slightly above their population mean (largely due to sleep reports), but Participant 2 shows a broader, stronger, and more directly PSS-linked pattern of elevation.

Weighted judgment
- Based on the balance of evidence (number of elevated indicators, their effect sizes/correlations with PSS, and coherence across symptom, behavioral, and physiological domains), Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress relative to their respective population.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (“Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations: certain early-morning HR values show larger negative deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).  
- Note on magnitude/weighting: these signals are modest compared with very strong protective indicators (maximal NGSE, very low GAD-7, strong circadian stability, very low RHR), and the summary explicitly places this participant below the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.5).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Extreme subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 14 (Z = +3.37), a very large outlier in the cohort and a strong contributor to elevated PSS.  
- Objective sleep irregularity: high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD Z ≈ +1.55) and sleep start time variability (Z ≈ +1.19), both modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.15–0.18).  
- Reduced circadian regularity and amplitude: interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.74, intradaily variability Z ≈ -1.16, autocorrelation Z ≈ -1.29, amplitude Z ≈ -0.81 — these pattern differences are associated with greater stress/reduced recovery.  
- Behavioral correlates: low reported exercise (Z ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and somewhat elevated alcohol use (Z ≈ +1.0) can accompany higher perceived stress.  
- Counterpoints: depression and trait anxiety scores are near or below mean; resting HR is typical; large total sleep time (median ~9h22m) but variable; these mitigate but do not outweigh the extreme PSQI and circadian irregularity per the summary. The study summary explicitly places this participant slightly above the mean (population mean PSS = 21.62).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s strongest signals that predict lower PSS are large in magnitude and consistent: maximal self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.79 with r = -0.60 to PSS), very low GAD-7 (Z ≈ -1.38 with r = +0.75 to PSS), low emotional/interpersonal distress, high interdaily stability and amplitude, and very low resting heart rate (RHR Z ≈ -2.23). Those features are all strongly associated with lower PSS in this cohort, and the summary explicitly judges P1 to be below the population mean (21.5). The countervailing indicators (PSQI = 7; some nocturnal HR signals) are moderate in effect size and fewer in number.  
- Participant 2’s principal risk signals for higher PSS are more extreme in the cohort frame: PSQI Z = +3.37 is well beyond typical variance and is flagged as the “strongest single indicator” of elevated perceived stress. Multiple corroborating objective markers (sleep variability, reduced interdaily stability and amplitude) and behavioral risks (low exercise, alcohol use) further point toward elevation. Although mood/anxiety scores and resting HR are not elevated, the magnitude of the sleep-related disturbances in Participant 2 is larger and more pervasive than the sleep concerns in Participant 1.

Overall balance and decision
- Given that Participant 1 is characterized by several large, protective indicators and only modest sleep-related risk (and is explicitly inferred to be below the sample mean), while Participant 2 has an extreme subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z +3.37) plus objective circadian/sleep irregularity and behavioral risks and is explicitly inferred to be slightly above the sample mean, the evidence supports that Participant 2 exhibits the higher overall perceived stress relative to their respective population.

- Multiple strong self-report predictors that correlate highly with PSS in that cohort:
  - Anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5) — very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).
  - Emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 6.33) — strong correlation with PSS (r = 0.67).
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9) — substantial correlation with PSS (r = 0.59).
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) that are meaningfully positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations at specific hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with stress-linked autonomic arousal.
- The integrative statement in the description explicitly concludes perceived stress is likely above the population mean (20.75), with survey indicators judged to have high predictive weight.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Elevated mood/anxiety symptom burden:
  - CES-D = 28 (classified “Depressed”; Z = 1.53) and STAI–Trait = 46; both positively correlated with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32).
- Short, late sleep (median 6:10, late sleep onset ~01:28) and variable sleep timing — sleep features that can contribute to higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting cardiovascular tone (RHR and MESOR above mean; Zs ≈ 0.6–1.3) with small positive correlations to PSS.
- Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg score Z ≈ −0.87) which modestly associates with higher PSS.

Comparative notes on signal strength and reliability (explicitly considering within-population frames)
- Strength of associations: Participant 1’s key self-report predictors have much larger correlations with PSS in their dataset (GAD-7 r = 0.80; Emotional Lability r = 0.67; PSQI r = 0.59) than Participant 2’s primary symptom predictors do in theirs (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32). Larger effect sizes indicate Participant 1’s elevated measures are more predictive of higher perceived stress within that cohort.
- Number and coherence of risk domains: Participant 1 shows several coherently elevated, strongly PSS-linked domains (anxiety, emotional lability, subjective sleep disturbance, pain), whereas Participant 2’s higher-risk features are primarily mood/depression plus short/late sleep and modest physiological elevation.
- Offsetting protective signals: Both descriptions note protective/mitigating factors. Participant 1 has robust circadian physiology and long objective sleep opportunity that likely reduce PSS but are judged insufficient to counter the strong survey signals. Participant 2 has multiple protective signals (high self-reported happiness, health satisfaction, low substance use, strong rhythm regularity) that the narrative treats as partially offsetting elevated depression/anxiety.
- Relative conclusions in original summaries: Both participants are described as likely above their respective population means, but Participant 1’s description emphasizes strong, high-weight predictors and judges stress above the mean despite protective physiology; Participant 2’s description characterizes the elevation as moderate and partially offset by resilience indicators.

Overall judgment
- Given the much larger predictive weights (correlations) of Participant 1’s self-report measures linked to PSS, the multiplicity of strongly associated adverse domains (anxiety, emotional lability, subjective poor sleep, pain), and the original author’s emphasis that these survey signals are the primary drivers despite some physiological strengths, Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress relative to their population. Participant 2 appears elevated but more moderately so and with stronger compensatory/resilience signals.

- Strong self-report risk signals that are highly correlated with PSS: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16, z = 1.16), high PSQI (15), elevated pain interference (PEG‑3 z = 1.18), and emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z = 1.23). Several of these instruments have large correlations with PSS in this sample.
- Low perceived coping resources: low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55), a strong negative correlate of PSS.
- Marked sleep/circadian pathology supportive of elevated stress: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low interdaily stability and low 24‑hr autocorrelation—patterns associated with chronic stress and poorer sleep regulation.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal that coheres with subjective stress: notable overnight heart‑rate elevations during typical sleep hours (hourly deviations with positive z and positive correlations with PSS).
- Convergence across modalities (self‑report + wearables) pointing toward nocturnal hyperarousal and disrupted rhythms strengthens the inference of above‑mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) despite adequate objective sleep duration — subjective poor sleep commonly elevates perceived stress reporting.
- Late sleep timing (median sleep onset ~01:26) and modestly elevated nap rate (z = 1.21), which weakly correlate with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Pronounced evening heart‑rate elevation (6–7 PM deviation z = 2.62) that could reflect sustained arousal or evening stressors.
- Lower health satisfaction (z = -1.20) which, though only weakly correlated here, can contribute to greater perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study population mean (P1 mean = 20.92; P2 mean = 21.63). Participant 1’s summary explicitly converges on “above the sample mean,” whereas Participant 2’s summary converges on “below the sample mean.”
- Strength and convergence of predictors: Participant 1 shows multiple high‑impact indicators that are strongly correlated with PSS (severe GAD, very short/late sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, low self‑efficacy, emotional lability). These indicators converge across self‑report and physiological streams, increasing confidence that this person’s PSS is elevated relative to their cohort.
- Participant 2 has some stress‑related signals (subjective poor sleep, late timing, evening HR), but the bulk of strong signals are protective (very low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness, high circadian amplitude/stability, low resting HR, robust social/behavioral supports). Those protective signals are numerous and strong (large z's and known negative correlations with PSS), making it likely this participant’s PSS is below their cohort mean.
- Magnitude and clinical significance: Participant 1’s objective sleep impairment (median <3 hours) and severe anxiety are extreme and, given their known correlations with PSS in the dataset, suggest a larger elevation above the mean than Participant 2’s modest risk signals suggest an elevation above their mean.
- Therefore, on balance, Participant 1 appears to have the worse overall perceived stress.

- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z ≈ 1.51). Anxiety in this sample is strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.75) and is identified as a major driver of higher perceived stress.  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ 0.83) plus objectively late sleep onset and short median sleep duration (~4 h 55 min), consistent with insomnia/night-time hyperarousal. Nighttime HR deviations are highly elevated (hourly HR deviation Z up to ≈ 2.83) and some nocturnal HR windows correlate with PSS — physiological evidence that reinforces the subjective sleep/anxiety signal.  
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS and reduce coping capacity.  
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), indicating reduced perceived ability to cope.  
- Multiple of these factors have relatively large effect sizes and direct, known links to perceived stress in the cohort; the integrated interpretation explicitly concludes PSS above the population mean (mean = 20.62).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (based on their description and within-study frame)
- Subjective sleep problems (PSQI = 6; crosses clinical threshold) and a late habitual sleep onset (~01:44) that could relate to evening/nighttime arousal or role strain.  
- Pronounced afternoon/evening heart-rate elevations (hourly HR deviation Z up to ~2.2), which could reflect physiological activation in the later day and may contribute to situational increases in perceived stress.  
- Slightly elevated alcohol use (Z ≈ 1.0) and somewhat lower self-reported happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), both modest risk indicators.  
- However, these risk signals are described as smaller and more situational; the overall profile for Participant 2 is characterized as near to slightly below the study mean PSS (mean = 21.62) because stronger protective signals dominate.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their study mean (20.62) with multiple large, convergent risk signals (severe anxiety, high PSQI, high pain, low self-efficacy, large nocturnal HR deviations). Several of these have strong correlations with PSS in that sample (notably anxiety). Effect sizes (Zs) for key risk variables are moderate-to-large.  
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as near or modestly below their study mean (21.62). Protective indicators (very low depression and trait-anxiety scores, low resting HR, high interdaily stability and amplitude, regular exercise) are coherent and comparatively strong; risk indicators are smaller and described as situational. Although Participant 2 has some evening HR elevations (Z up to ~2.2), those risks are offset by multiple stronger resilience signals and overall small correlations between many features and PSS in that dataset.
- Both descriptions are relative to different population means, but the within-sample signal strength matters: Participant 1’s high-stress indicators are numerous, larger in magnitude, and include variables with strong sample-level correlations to PSS; Participant 2’s risk signals are fewer, smaller in effect, and counterbalanced by robust protective factors.

- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (i.e., a PSS above their cohort mean), whereas Participant 2 is characterized as near-to-below their cohort mean. Therefore Participant 1 likely has the worse overall perceived stress.

22,97448,10,20,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83), a strong correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58). This is a substantive upward driver.
- Very short median wearable-recorded sleep and variable sleep timing (median ≈ 1h44m, start-time SD ≈ 160 min) that align with the high PSQI and suggest nocturnal disruption.
- Elevated pain and activity interference: PEG-3 ≈ 7.78 (Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS ≈ 78 (Z ≈ +0.8); both moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56).
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations consistent with arousal (midnight–early morning increases) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS.
- Summary label: the report explicitly interprets the participant as “near” the mean but “modestly above” the mean because sleep disturbance and pain push PSS upward.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep complaints: PSQI = 6 (clinically >5) even though the PSQI is slightly below the population mean (Z ≈ -0.33); this could elevate perceived stress situationally.
- Late habitual sleep onset (median ≈ 01:44), which can associate with stress or social/schedule strain in some contexts.
- Marked evening heart-rate elevations (hourly HR deviations with Z up to ≈ +2.2) suggesting late-day physiological activation that could reflect arousal/stress.
- Slightly elevated alcohol use (1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1.0) and modestly lower happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) that could co-occur with higher situational stress.
- However, many of these risk signals are either small relative to population norms or counterbalanced by stronger protective features (low depression/anxiety scores, high circadian stability, low RHR, regular exercise).

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighting
- Each profile is described relative to its own sample mean. Participant 1 is characterized by the report as near the sample mean but “modestly above” it, driven primarily by elevated PSQI (Z ≈ +0.83) plus pain/interference (Z ≈ +0.7–0.8). Those predictors have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is characterized as near to modestly below their sample mean. Although Participant 2 shows some risk signs (PSQI > clinical threshold, late sleep onset, strong evening HR deviations), those risk measures are weaker in the population-relative sense (PSQI Z ≈ -0.33; late timing is consistent rather than irregular) and are outweighed by multiple stronger protective indicators (CES-D and STAI well below mean, high circadian stability and amplitude, low RHR, regular exercise).
- The magnitude and number of population-relative risk markers that predict higher PSS are greater for Participant 1 (notably PSQI and pain measures with substantial Z-scores and known moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS) than for Participant 2 (where protective markers dominate and risk signals are either smaller relative to population means or situational).

Conclusion
Based on the within-population comparisons and the balance of evidence, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Strong subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15.5 (classified Disturbed Sleep), PSQI correlates with PSS in this sample (r = 0.53); PSQI is well above sample mean (Z ≈ 0.67).  
- High pain / functional interference: PAPAS = 81 (Z ≈ 0.93) and PAPAS correlates with PSS (r = 0.53).  
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z = -0.62 and NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.69), so this is a strong risk indicator.  
- Elevated cardiac markers linked to stress: higher mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and pronounced nocturnal HR deviations (Zs up to ≈1.38) that correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).  
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83), indicating irregular daily timing, which modestly associates with higher PSS.  
- Integrated summary in the description explicitly concludes PSS is likely above the sample mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7) with very late median sleep onset (02:28) and night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ 0.41); sleep timing variability correlates positively with PSS (corr ≈ 0.17).  
- Weak circadian regularity: interdaily stability and especially 24-hour autocorrelation are low (autocorr Z ≈ -1.45); these metrics modestly associate with higher PSS (correlations ≈ -0.12 to -0.17).  
- Lower momentary positive affect: self-reported happiness below sample mean (Z ≈ -0.53) and somewhat lower trust (Z ≈ -0.46), which can relate to higher perceived stress.  
- Integrated summary indicates a modest tilt toward slightly above-mean PSS, but not a clear high-stress signature.

Comparative weighing (within each study frame)
- Strength and consistency of stress indicators: Participant 1 shows multiple, relatively strong signals that are individually well correlated with PSS in that sample (PSQI and PAPAS r ≈ 0.53; NGSE r ≈ -0.69; nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.47). Participant 2’s stress-related signals are weaker both in magnitude and in sample-level correlations (sleep timing variability and circadian fragmentation correlations ≈ 0.12–0.17).  
- Protective factors: Participant 2 has several substantial protective indicators (low resting HR and mesor, regular exercise, low depressive burden, high health satisfaction) that are plausibly stress-buffering. Participant 1 has some mitigating features (low GAD-7, long median sleep duration), but these appear less powerful given the strong pain, poor subjective sleep, low self-efficacy, and nocturnal HR elevations.  
- Net inference in each description: Participant 1 is judged “likely above” their population mean; Participant 2 is judged “near the mean” with only a modest tilt above. Given stronger, multi-domain risk signals for Participant 1 and stronger protective signals for Participant 2, the balance favors Participant 1 having the higher perceived stress relative to their sample.

7,71193,15,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1's study frame)
- Very high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 39; z = 2.67) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T z = 1.85). Both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so these large symptom elevations are strong indicators of higher perceived stress relative to this study's mean (21.61).
- Low positive affect and self-esteem (happy z = -1.61; RSES z = -1.43), which are modestly negatively correlated with PSS (happiness r ≈ -0.19; self-esteem r ≈ -0.15), supporting elevated stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) despite adequate objective duration — subjective poor sleep is commonly tied to higher perceived stress.
- Low socializing and infrequent exercise, plus low health satisfaction and trust — psychosocial deficits that tend to elevate perceived stress.
- Although some physiological/circadian metrics are protective (long objective sleep duration, strong interdaily stability and HR amplitude), these do not, per the description, outweigh the strong psychological symptom burden.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2's study frame)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5) and very short median wearable-recorded sleep (4 h 22 min) with large night-to-night variability — poor/irregular sleep is a robust correlate of PSS in this dataset (PSQI r ≈ 0.53) and supports elevated perceived stress relative to this study's mean (21.29).
- Elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 Interpersonal z = 2.34), indicating social strain that can contribute to ongoing perceived stress.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude z ≈ -0.84; interdaily stability z ≈ -1.05), consistent with disrupted daily structure that commonly accompanies higher stress.
- Countervailing factors: minimal current anxiety (GAD-7 z = -1.38), low pain and emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, and lower resting HR — these are protective and push inference toward PSS near or below the study mean. The holistic assessment provided judged the participant near the mean with only a modest tilt above it.

Comparative reasoning (taking each profile relative to its own population mean)
- Strength and type of signals: Participant 1 shows very large elevations on direct mood/anxiety measures that have established moderate correlations with PSS in that study (CES-D z = 2.67; STAI z = 1.85). Those are direct, strong predictors of perceived stress in that population.
- Participant 2’s strongest objective/self-report stressors are severe sleep deprivation/irregularity and interpersonal problems. Sleep disturbance here has a fairly large sample correlation with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.53), and the wearable-recorded extremely short sleep is a clinically important risk factor. However, many other indices for Participant 2 (anxiety, pain, emotional lability, self-efficacy, resting HR) are near or below the mean and argue against a high PSS; the study summary judged them close to the mean.
- Relative magnitude and coherence: Participant 1’s profile is dominated by multiple strong, coherent psychological risk signals (depression, trait anxiety, low positive affect/self-esteem, subjective poor sleep, low social support). Participant 2’s high-risk signals are concentrated in sleep and interpersonal strain but are partially offset by several protective psychosocial and physiological indicators.
- Both profiles are described as plausibly above their respective means, but Participant 1 is portrayed as clearly above the mean while Participant 2 is characterized as near the mean with only a modest tilt above it.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of evidence (magnitude and directness of depression/anxiety signals for Participant 1 vs. mixed high-risk and protective signals for Participant 2), Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5; PSQI Z ≈ 0.59), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Strong wearable-derived evidence of circadian disruption: low interdaily stability (Z = −1.48), reduced amplitude (Z = −1.61), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.51). These rhythm irregularities are associated (albeit modestly) with higher PSS in the sample.
- Very high night-to-night sleep timing variability (sleep-start SD Z = 2.74), which correlates with greater perceived stress.
- Modestly elevated resting heart rate (Z ≈ 0.48) and flattened amplitude/mesor pattern, consistent with greater physiological arousal that can accompany stress.
- Several of these risk indicators (anxiety/depression, sleep disturbance, circadian fragmentation, timing variability) co-occur, increasing likelihood of above-mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population):
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5), and PSQI has a moderate correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47).
- Pain and activity interference (PEG/PAPAS) above median and moderately correlated with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47), which can elevate perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54) that may reduce social support.
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), which might reflect higher basal arousal (though physiological–PSS correlations are weak).
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5), and PSS strongly correlates with GAD-7 (r ≈ 0.77), though this participant’s GAD-7 is low in absolute terms.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing of evidence:
- Strength and direction of key predictors: Participant 1 shows large positive deviations on measures that correlate with PSS (particularly trait anxiety and depressive symptoms), whereas Participant 2’s strongest deviations are protective (high NGSE Z = 1.41; NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS, r ≈ −0.63).
- Magnitude and clustering of risk factors: Participant 1 has a cluster of sizeable risk indicators (high anxiety/depression, severe sleep-timing irregularity Z = 2.74, circadian fragmentation) that together point clearly above their population mean. Participant 2 has notable risks (poor subjective sleep, pain, interpersonal strain) but also strong and highly relevant protective factors (high self-efficacy, robust circadian regularity, low emotional lability) that the summary explicitly weighs as likely offsetting the risks.
- Correlation strengths matter: For Participant 2, the single strongest correlates in the dataset (GAD-7 and NGSE) favor lower PSS because NGSE is strongly protective and GAD-7 is only mildly elevated here. For Participant 1, the elevated STAI/CES-D are meaningful predictors of higher PSS even if individual correlations are modest.
- Net balance: Participant 1’s pattern is interpreted by the source as “above the study population mean,” whereas Participant 2’s profile is interpreted as “near or slightly below the mean.” The objective deviations (Z-scores) for stress-relevant risk factors are generally larger and more concentrated for Participant 1 than for Participant 2.

Final determination
Given the larger-magnitude, convergent risk signals in Participant 1 (notably high trait anxiety/depression and marked circadian/sleep-timing irregularity) versus Participant 2’s mixed profile with strong protective factors (notably high NGSE and robust circadian regularity), Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- Very severe and objectively short sleep: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”) and median wearable sleep ≈ 3 h/night. These sleep measures are both extreme (objective and subjective) and strongly positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Large sleep-timing variability and circadian instability: very large night-to-night variation in sleep start (SD Z = 2.82) and reduced interdaily stability/amplitude (Zs ≈ -1.42, -1.10). These circadian disruptions correlate positively with PSS in the cohort.
- Elevated anxiety and affective lability: GAD-7 = 9 and elevated BASIS-24 emotional lability (both measures that show strong positive correlations with PSS in the sample, especially GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.78).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: relatively high substance-abuse subscale (Z = 1.75) and pain scores that correlate positively with PSS—additional contributors to elevated perceived stress.
- Multiple strongly PSS-correlated indicators point in the same direction (sleep + anxiety + substance/pain), increasing confidence that P1 is above their population mean.

Protective/mitigating factors to note (within-sample frame)
- Very high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79), which has a substantial negative correlation with PSS and is a strong resilience factor.
- Relatively low resting heart rate/mesor (Zs ≈ -0.55, -0.66), which does not indicate high tonic physiological arousal in this sample.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Disturbed sleep timing and some subjective sleep disturbance: median sleep start ≈ 03:00 and PSQI = 6 (disturbed sleep), which are associated with higher PSS.
- Nocturnal/evening physiological arousal: pronounced late-evening/around-midnight heart-rate elevations (hourly deviations Z up to ~2.8) and shifted/damped circadian heart-rate structure (amplitude Z = -1.11; interdaily stability Z = -0.99). These nocturnal arousal features in the cohort are associated with higher PSS.
- Behavioral/social risk factors: low frequency of exercise (Z ≈ -0.43), low social time (Z = -1.41), and low health satisfaction (Z = -0.70), which can increase perceived stress exposure or reduce buffering.
- Slightly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.07) and some nocturnal HR features that have modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample.

Protective/mitigating factors to note (within-sample frame)
- Low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ -0.45) and high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.52) — both associated with lower PSS in the sample.
- Low resting heart rate (Z ≈ -0.71), minimal substance use, and strong academic performance — indicating functional coping and fewer stress-amplifying behaviors.
- Overall the summary explicitly judged P2 to be near the population mean PSS (21.61), perhaps modestly above due to nocturnal arousal, not clearly well above.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Magnitude and number of strong PSS-linked indicators: Participant 1 presents several extreme, concordant signals that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (very short objective sleep, very high PSQI, elevated GAD-7, substance problems, circadian instability). Several of these are both large in magnitude and strongly associated with PSS in that cohort.
- Participant 2 shows notable risk signals (late sleep timing, nocturnal HR elevations, circadian dampening, low social/exercise), but many of these are moderate in magnitude and some key psychological symptoms are low (depression low, only slight STAI elevation). The summary explicitly places P2 near the study mean (with only a modest tilt above it).
- Protective factors in P1 (especially high self-efficacy) are substantial, but they do not fully counterbalance the combination of extreme sleep deprivation, anxiety-related signals, and substance-related problems — all of which are tightly linked to PSS in that sample.
- By contrast, P2’s protective factors (low depression, high self-esteem, low substance use, good academic functioning) are more numerous and appear to offset risk signals to produce an overall near-mean inferred PSS.

Overall judgement
- Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse (higher) overall perceived stress relative to their study population. The intensity and coherence of multiple, strongly PSS-associated indicators (particularly the extremely short objective sleep plus elevated anxiety and substance-related problems) provide stronger evidence for an above-mean PSS than the more mixed/moderate profile seen for Participant 2, who was inferred near the population mean.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 45; Z ≈ +0.37), which in this dataset is a strong psychological correlate of higher PSS.

- Lower self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 31; Z ≈ -1.01) and modest depressive symptoms noted, which modestly push toward higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.29)
- Strong subjective signals: very poor sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ +0.67) and high pain/functional interference (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ +0.93); both measures correlate moderately–strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.62), which is strongly negatively correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.69), so below-average NGSE predicts higher PSS.
- Objective physiology consistent with stress: elevated mesor and resting HR (Mesor 81.1 Z ≈ +0.7; RHR 70.47 Z ≈ +0.61) and repeated nocturnal HR elevations (midnight–early-morning HR deviations with Zs up to ≈ +1.38) that, in this dataset, associate with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83) and late acrophase, suggesting less regular circadian timing, which is linked to higher PSS here.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- The two population means are nearly identical (21.61 vs 21.29), so absolute mean differences do not materially affect the comparison; we must rely on each participant’s pattern relative to their own sample.
- Participant 1’s upward signals are mainly subjective (moderate trait anxiety, mild sleep complaints, shorter sleep) but are counterbalanced by multiple strong objective and behavioral protective factors (very high interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.99, high amplitude Z ≈ +1.64, low resting HR Z ≈ -1.04, consistent sleep timing, frequent exercise, low substance use). Several of those objective features have moderate-to-strong negative correlations with PSS in the sample, and their Z-scores are relatively large.
- Participant 2 presents multiple strong risk signals that are each well-correlated with PSS in that sample: poor subjective sleep (PSQI), high pain/PAPAS, low self-efficacy (NGSE), elevated nocturnal HR and higher mesor/RHR, and reduced interdaily stability. While Participant 2 has some mitigating features (mild GAD-7, longer sleep duration, low intradaily variability), the risk signals are more numerous, larger in magnitude, and tied to sample-level correlations that are strong (especially NGSE and PSQI/PAPAS).
- Overall balance: Participant 1 is described as near or slightly below their sample mean when objective rhythms and behaviors are weighted; Participant 2 is described as above their sample mean, with several robust and convergent predictors of higher PSS.

- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7) and low self-esteem (RSES z = -0.87), both of which typically covary with higher perceived stress in the sample.
- Behavioral risk factors: very low physical activity, minimal socializing, and a very high sedentary-hobby score (z = 2.01), reducing behavioral coping resources and associated with higher stress.
- Modest physiological signs of elevated arousal: resting HR and mesor moderately above mean (RHR z = 0.6; mesor z = 0.83) and evening/night HR elevations — patterns that often accompany higher perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction (z = -1.45), a psychosocial indicator that aligns with greater perceived stress.

Reasons mitigating a high-PSS inference for Participant 1 (included to show balance within-frame):
- Strong circadian regularity and consolidated activity (interdaily stability z = 1.41; 24-h autocorrelation z = 0.81; intradaily variability z = -0.53), and consistent, adequate average sleep duration (median ~7 h 54 min, z = 0.89). These features are protective and lean toward lower PSS.

Potential reasons why Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean):
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and very short objective sleep (median 3 h 27 min, z = -0.66), with high night-to-night variability (SD z = 0.62) and increased naps (z = 1.24). Sleep measures correlate with higher PSS in the sample and are strong stress risk factors here.
- High intradaily variability (z = 2.29), indicating fragmented rest–activity rhythms that in the sample trend toward higher PSS.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain subscore (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = 0.94), which could contribute to perceived stress (though its correlation with PSS is small).

Reasons mitigating a high-PSS inference for Participant 2 (and strongly favoring lower PSS, within-frame):
- Very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 4, z = -0.94). GAD-7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.76), so low GAD-7 is a powerful indicator of lower perceived stress.
- High self-efficacy (NGSE z = 0.49), and NGSE is strongly inversely related to PSS in the sample (r = -0.65), predicting lower stress.
- Very low emotional lability (z = -1.67) and low pain scores (PEG-3 z = -1.28), both associated with lower or only modestly higher PSS.
- Physiological indicators (slightly lower RHR z = -0.30, preserved diurnal HR amplitude) that in the sample relate to lower PSS.

Comparative, within-population weighing of evidence:
- Participant 1’s profile contains multiple moderate-to-strong indicators that, within their study sample, are positively associated with higher PSS (notably elevated depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, pronounced sedentary behavior, low health satisfaction, and modest physiological arousal). Although circadian regularity and adequate sleep quantity are protective, the number and relevance of affective and behavioral risk signals tilt the balance toward above-mean PSS.
- Participant 2 shows severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance and high activity fragmentation — important risk signals for higher PSS — but the single strongest sample-level predictors (very low GAD-7 and relatively high NGSE, both strongly associated with PSS) point strongly toward below-mean PSS. The report explicitly weighs the strong predictive power of these measures and concludes the overall inference is below the population mean despite sleep-related risks.

Overall determination:
- Taking the within-sample associations and the balance of risk/protective indicators into account, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (i.e., a higher PSS relative to their population mean) than Participant 2.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, exceeds common cutoff) indicating sleep problems that can elevate stress.
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity: reduced interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, slightly elevated intradaily variability — these patterns can associate with higher stress.
- Pronounced evening and late‑night heart‑rate elevations (large hourly HR peaks, Z up to +3.51) consistent with episodic evening physiological arousal.
- Low socializing time (≈15 minutes, Z = −2.20), a behavioral vulnerability that can contribute to greater perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if applicable)
- Strong subjective and objective sleep disruption: very high PSQI (16.5, Z = 1.0), extremely short median nightly sleep (2 h 38 m, Z = −0.94), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median 03:12 AM; SD Z = +1.3). These strongly predict higher PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.47).
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: notable overnight heart‑rate elevations (1–2 AM +13.5 bpm, 3–4 AM +9.8 bpm; Zs > +1) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10, moderate anxiety). Anxiety had the strongest correlation with PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.78), so this is a major driver toward higher perceived stress.
- Pain‑related interference (PAPAS elevated) which also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Circadian disruption (low interdaily stability, low 24‑h autocorrelation, elevated intradaily variability) and shifted cardiac acrophase consistent with physiological/behavioral schedule dysregulation associated with greater stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each summary is given relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1 is interpreted by the study authors as below the population mean PSS (i.e., lower perceived stress than their peers; population mean = 21.62). Participant 2 is interpreted as above their population mean PSS (i.e., higher perceived stress than their peers; population mean = 20.75).
- The balance of Participant 1’s evidence strongly favors lower perceived stress: multiple protective self-report markers (low depression and trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and momentary happiness), frequent exercise, minimal substance use, and general health satisfaction. The signals that point toward elevated stress (PSQI at cutoff, wearable circadian irregularity, evening HR peaks, low socializing) are secondary and described as smaller in magnitude and correlation with PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2’s profile contains several primary, strongly PSS‑related risk signals: severe subjective and objective sleep loss/irregularity, nocturnal HR elevations, and moderate clinical anxiety—features that in this sample have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (especially GAD‑7). Protective factors (higher self‑efficacy, low emotional lability) are present but the report explicitly concludes the preponderance of evidence indicates PSS above the study mean.
- Given that Participant 1 is described as likely below their study mean and Participant 2 is described as likely above theirs, and given the relative strength and relevance of the features associated with PSS in each case (Participant 2’s sleep and anxiety signals are more severe and more strongly correlated with PSS than Participant 1’s wearable/circadian signals), the balance of evidence favors Participant 2 as having the higher perceived stress.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.46) and depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 0.28), both of which correlate positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28).
- Poorer subjective sleep (PSQI = 7; Z ≈ 0.13) and slightly short median sleep duration (6 h 54 min; Z ≈ −0.35) with high sleep-start variability (SD = 87 min), which can increase perceived stress.
- Low happiness (Z = −1.61) and low self‑esteem (RSES Z = −1.01), constructs that in this sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated resting heart rate (Z ≈ 0.84) and unfavorable lifestyle indicators (minimal exercise, low social/recreational engagement, BMI ≈ 30, low health satisfaction) that can contribute to greater perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might NOT have higher PSS (protective relative signals)
- Strongly regular circadian/physiological rhythms (interdaily stability Z = 1.24; 24‑h autocorrelation Z = 1.40; intradaily variability Z = −0.74; amplitude Z = 0.82), which in this sample correlate negatively with PSS and are plausibly buffering stress.
- No substance use or napping, removing common stress/sleep risk factors.

- Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; Z = 0.67) and extremely short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) with very large night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD z ≈ 0.89; sleep onset variability z ≈ 0.34). PSQI has a relatively strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Substantial interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 Interpersonal Relationships Z = 2.34), a large deviation that likely contributes to ongoing perceived stress even if that subscale’s direct correlation with PSS is weaker.
- Blunted/dampened circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude Z ≈ −0.84; interdaily stability Z ≈ −1.05), indicating disrupted daily structure that typically accompanies higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might NOT have higher PSS (protective relative signals)
- Minimal current anxiety (GAD‑7 Z = −1.38), low pain (PEG‑3/PAPAS z ≈ −1.29), and low emotional lability (z ≈ −1.27), all arguing against high concurrent subjective distress.
- Self‑efficacy near the study mean (NGSE Z ≈ −0.07); self‑efficacy strongly negatively correlates with PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.66), so an average score leaves less reason to expect markedly elevated PSS.
- Lower resting heart rate / MESOR (resting HR ≈ 59 bpm), consistent with lower tonic arousal.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Participant 1’s affective symptom elevations are modest (small positive Zs) but numerous (anxiety, depression, low happiness, low self‑esteem, elevated resting HR, poor lifestyle). However several of the participant’s strongest deviations are protective (very high interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation, amplitude moderate), which were noted to correlate negatively with PSS. The original synthesis judged Participant 1 likely modestly above their population mean but not extreme.
- Participant 2 shows very large, objective and subjective sleep deficits (extremely short sleep, high variability, high PSQI) and very large interpersonal problems (BASIS‑24 Z = 2.34). The PSQI has a relatively strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.53), and circadian dysregulation (low interdaily stability, low amplitude) further aligns with higher stress. Protective signs (very low anxiety, low pain, average self‑efficacy, low resting HR) are notable but some are discordant with the strong sleep/interpersonal/circadian signals.

Balancing the evidence
- Participant 1: several modest psychosocial risk indicators but also strong physiological/circadian resilience signals; likely modestly above their mean.
- Participant 2: multiple large-magnitude stress-relevant signals (extremely short/irregular sleep, high PSQI, and very high interpersonal strain) plus circadian disruption. Even though some symptom domains (anxiety, pain) are low, the magnitude and established strong association of sleep disturbance (and the very large interpersonal z) with PSS make a stronger case that Participant 2’s perceived stress is as high or higher than Participant 1’s relative-to-their own populations.

Conclusion
Given the severity and magnitude of sleep disturbance, large night‑to‑night variability, marked interpersonal strain, and circadian disruption in Participant 2 — versus Participant 1’s more modest symptom elevations that are counterbalanced by strong circadian regularity — Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

3,46558,13,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean = 21.61)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 17; z ≈ +0.38). CES‑D correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28), so this is a direct risk factor.
- Slightly elevated resting heart rate (60.7 bpm; z ≈ +0.3) and modestly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.32), both of which show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14 and r ≈ 0.16 respectively) and can reflect increased physiological/behavioral stress.
- Low physical activity and high sedentary leisure (heavy video‑game use) — while not strongly correlated with PSS in this dataset, they are plausible behavioral contributors to elevated perceived stress or worse coping in broader literature.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.38)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5). PSQI has a moderate-to-strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47), so poor perceived sleep quality is a substantial risk factor here.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3 ≈ 4.9; PAPAS ≈ 50). These measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.42–0.47) and are above typical population medians for this study, indicating a meaningful burden that can raise perceived stress.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ +1.2 each), which may reflect greater basal autonomic arousal associated with stress in some individuals.
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal Z ≈ +1.54), which can reduce perceived support and contribute to stress even if its direct sample correlation with PSS is small.

Comparative weighing of evidence (within each study’s frame)
- Strength and direction of relationships: Participant 2’s principal risk features (high PSQI, pain/interference) map onto measures that show stronger correlations with PSS in their sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.47; PEG/PAPAS r ≈ 0.42–0.47). Participant 1’s primary risk signal (CES‑D) has a weaker association with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.28), and other risk indicators for Participant 1 show only small correlations with PSS.
- Magnitude of risk vs protective factors: Participant 1 has several clear protective signals (high current happiness z ≈ +1.64, good circadian regularity z ≈ +0.8, adequate sleep duration and low variability, elevated self‑esteem and health satisfaction) that, in this sample, are associated with lower PSS and appear fairly strong. Participant 2 also has strong protective features (very high self‑efficacy NGSE z ≈ +1.41 which has a strong inverse correlation with PSS r ≈ −0.63, and very high circadian regularity z’s ≈ +2.13 and +1.57). However, Participant 2’s high PSQI and pain burdens are notable because those variables have moderate correlations with PSS and their absolute values are meaningfully elevated.
- Physiological arousal: Participant 2 shows larger physiological elevation (resting HR/mesor z ≈ +1.2) than Participant 1 (resting HR z ≈ +0.3), which favors higher perceived stress for Participant 2.
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s risk signals are relatively modest and outweighed by several substantial protective factors (especially very high happiness and solid circadian/sleep metrics). Participant 2 shows a mixed profile in which relatively strong protective resources (high NGSE, exceptional circadian regularity, emotional stability) are counterbalanced by pronounced subjective sleep disturbance and pain/interference, and greater physiological arousal.

Conclusion
Taken together, the evidence indicates Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit a higher PSS relative to their study peers than Participant 1 is relative to theirs. Although both profiles were ultimately characterized as near their sample means, Participant 2’s combination of clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance, pain/interference, and higher physiological arousal—coupled with those variables’ moderate correlations with PSS in that study—tilts the balance toward a higher inferred perceived stress compared with Participant 1, whose modest risk signals are outweighed by strong protective indicators.

13,62617,28,17,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report signals that correlate highly with PSS in that study: mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5; GAD-7 r = 0.80 with PSS), emotional lability (BASIS-24 r = 0.67), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; PSQI r = 0.59). These are high‑weight predictors of perceived stress in that dataset.
- Pain and functional interference are nontrivial (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) and both correlate positively with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50), providing additional stress-related burden.
- Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations in specific late-night hours that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45) suggest nocturnal autonomic arousal linked to higher perceived stress.
- The integrative statement in the description explicitly infers perceived stress above the study mean (population mean PSS = 20.75) after weighing these indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Reduced day‑to‑day circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = −1.73) and lower circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = −1.01) are physiological vulnerabilities that, in population studies, associate with higher stress or poorer mood.
- Pronounced evening HR elevations (7–10 pm) and small positive correlations between some early‑morning HR deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.2) indicate episodic physiological arousal that could reflect stressors tied to evening activities or schedule irregularity.
- However, these physiological signals are moderate in magnitude and described as potential vulnerabilities rather than dominant indicators of high perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑frame reasoning
- Each description is referenced to its own study mean: Participant 1 is judged likely above their study mean (20.75); Participant 2 is judged likely below their study mean (21.63). So, within their respective samples, P1 > mean and P2 < mean.
- Strength and direction of evidence: Participant 1’s elevation is supported by several high‑weight self‑report predictors that have strong correlations with PSS in that dataset (especially GAD-7 and emotional lability). Although wearable physiology for P1 provides notable protective signals (robust circadian amplitude and clear daytime activation), the write‑up concludes these do not outweigh the survey indicators.
- Participant 2 shows strong, convergent evidence for lower perceived stress: very low depressive and trait anxiety scores (large negative Zs), high happiness and self‑esteem, regular exercise, and objectively long and consistent sleep. The wearable vulnerabilities for P2 (low interdaily stability and amplitude, some evening HR elevation) are moderate and are explicitly described as nuanced caveats rather than primary indicators of high stress.
- Net comparison: P1 is characterized as above-mean stress driven by multiple strongly PSS‑associated self‑report measures; P2 is characterized as below-mean stress with multiple strong, convergent psychosocial and behavioral indicators of low stress. The magnitude and consistency of P2’s low-symptom profile outweigh P2’s moderate physiological vulnerabilities, while P1’s multiple strong self‑report stressors outweigh their physiological strengths.

Conclusion
Based on the within‑study framings and the balance of evidence, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

19,73158,28,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong contributors tied to higher PSS in this cohort:
  - Moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10) and anxiety has the strongest correlation with PSS in the sample (r = 0.78), so even a modestly elevated GAD‑7 is a major risk for higher perceived stress.
  - Severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16.5 (Z = +1.0) and extremely short median sleep duration (2 h 38 min, Z = −0.94), very late sleep timing (03:12 AM), and high night‑to‑night variability (sleep onset SD Z = +1.3). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.47).
  - Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart‑rate deviations (1–2 AM Z ≈ +1.17; 3–4 AM Z ≈ +1.59) and circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability and autocorrelation), which are associated with higher PSS (overnight HR r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
  - Some pain‑related functional interference (PAPAS = 65) and pain correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.48).
- Protective factors present but smaller or insufficient to offset the above:
  - Above‑average self‑efficacy (Z = +0.3) and low emotional lability (Z = −0.97); both are negatively associated with PSS (self‑efficacy r = −0.68; lability r = +0.72), but the description frames these as partial buffers rather than dominant.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Possible contributors to higher perceived stress:
  - Pronounced early‑morning heart‑rate elevations (5–6 AM Z = +3.10; 6–7 AM Z = +4.41). These hourly deviations have a small‑to‑moderate positive correlation with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.21–0.23), so large morning peaks could raise perceived stress somewhat.
  - Shorter median nocturnal sleep duration (6 h 11 min, Z ≈ −1.25) despite good subjective sleep quality—reduced sleep time can be a vulnerability.
  - Modest sleep‑start variability (SD ≈ 67 min), which could contribute to situational stress when combined with morning arousal.
- However, these risk features are relatively circumscribed and/or have smaller correlations with PSS than some of Participant 1’s signals.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is given relative to its own cohort mean. Participant 1 is inferred to be above their population mean (study mean 20.75) largely because of multiple strong, converging predictors of PSS in that sample: especially anxiety (highest correlation with PSS), very poor sleep (PSQI and extremely short objective sleep), and nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (moderate correlations).
- Participant 2 is inferred to be below their population mean (study mean 21.62). Although they have notable early‑morning HR peaks and somewhat shorter sleep duration, the bulk of indicators (very low depression and trait‑anxiety scores, high self‑esteem and happiness, good subjective sleep quality, low resting HR, frequent group exercise) point toward substantially lower perceived stress. Crucially, the strongest predictors of PSS in these data (e.g., anxiety, PSQI) are not elevated for Participant 2 and are markedly protective.
- Weighting the relative strength and correlation sizes: Participant 1’s elevated anxiety and profound sleep disturbance are linked to the largest correlations with PSS in their cohort (notably the GAD‑7 → PSS association r = 0.78 and PSQI r = 0.47). Participant 2’s concerning signals (morning HR peaks, shorter sleep) have smaller correlations with PSS and occur alongside multiple strong protective indicators (large negative Zs for CES‑D and STAI, high Rosenberg score, low RHR).

Conclusion
Given the stronger, higher‑impact risk signals for perceived stress in Participant 1 (particularly anxiety and extreme objective/subjective sleep disruption with supporting nocturnal physiological arousal) versus Participant 2’s predominantly protective profile with only modest physiological vulnerabilities, Participant 1 is likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

21,22913,30,20,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 12; z ≈ +0.46) with a very strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77). This is the single strongest predictor in the profile.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; z ≈ +1.32), itself correlated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.45).
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: large overnight heart-rate deviations (e.g., +11.92 bpm at 12–1am; z ≈ +1.02) that show positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.22–0.39).
- Emotional regulation vulnerability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability correlates ≈ 0.68 with PSS).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ -0.66), consistent with greater perceived stress susceptibility.
- Elevated substance-abuse score (z ≈ +1.5) which, while not strongly correlated with PSS here, is a stress-relevant behavior to note.

Participant 1 — mitigating factors (reduce but do not eliminate likelihood of higher PSS)
- Adequate objective sleep duration (median ≈ 7h19m; z ≈ +0.66).
- Lower resting heart rate (z ≈ -0.64) and modestly preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation — signs of physiological resilience with weaker negative correlations to PSS.
- Lower pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS z ≈ -1.1).

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS
- Higher resting HR (64.6 bpm; z ≈ +0.77) and especially a high HR mesor (87.24; z ≈ +1.81); both have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ +0.14 or similar).
- Low physical activity / sedentary lifestyle (exercise rare; negative z-scores), which can be associated with higher stress vulnerability.
- Above-average alcohol use (z ≈ +1.0) and below-average self-reported happiness (z ≈ -0.53); both have small associations with higher PSS in this sample.

Participant 2 — reasons for lower PSS (stronger evidence)
- Absence of depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 0; z ≈ -1.38) and below-average trait anxiety (STAI-T z ≈ -0.72) — strong psychological indicators of lower perceived stress.
- Long and consistent objective sleep (median ≈ 8h37m; z ≈ +1.79) and low intradaily variability (z ≈ -1.8), both robust markers of stable sleep/circadian function that are associated with lower PSS.
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI ≈ 5; z ≈ -0.8) and preserved circadian amplitude (z ≈ +0.84).

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s indicators that point upward are both large in magnitude and tied to strong PSS correlations (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.77, BASIS-24 Emotional Lability r ≈ 0.68, PSQI r ≈ 0.45). Several of these signals (anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, nocturnal HR arousal) are high-impact predictors of higher perceived stress relative to P1’s study population mean (20.67).
- Participant 2’s upward cues (resting HR, mesor, alcohol use, low activity) are smaller in effect and have weaker correlations with PSS in that study. In contrast, P2 shows multiple strong, favorable indicators (CES‑D = 0; long, regular sleep; very low intradaily variability) that are relatively large in magnitude and point to perceived stress below their population mean (21.62).
- Weighing magnitude and predictive strength: P1’s high-impact symptom signals and their strong correlations with PSS outweigh P1’s mitigating physiological signs, making an above-mean PSS more likely. P2’s few small-risk signals are outweighed by several larger-magnitude protective signals tied to lower PSS. Thus, relative to their respective populations, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) perceived stress.

- Markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 35; z ≈ 2.26) — depression is positively associated with PSS in this sample.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ 1.55) — anxiety correlates positively with PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 14; z ≈ 3.37) and low momentary happiness (z = -1.61), both commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral marker of dysregulated sleep/wake (increased daytime napping; z ≈ 1.9) that has been linked to higher PSS in the cohort.
- Small wearable-derived signals (early-morning HR deviations, intradaily variability) that weakly align with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not extremely high) PSS
- Objective median nightly sleep duration is adequate (≈7 h 24 min; z ≈ 0.27).
- Night-to-night sleep timing and duration variability are not large (sleep SD z's ≈ -0.54 and -0.72).
- Reasonably robust circadian metrics (amplitude z ≈ 0.34; interdaily stability ~average).
- Slightly below-average resting HR and frequent social exercise (z ≈ 1.23) and preserved academic functioning — all potential stress buffers.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Severe and objectively extreme sleep disturbance: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 hours and very large variability in sleep start time (SD = 401 min; z = 2.82). Short sleep and high timing variability are strongly linked to higher PSS.
- High subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13.5) — PSQI correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.50).
- Elevated anxiety/emotional lability: GAD‑7 = 9 (and in this sample GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS, r ≈ 0.78), and BASIS-24 emotional lability (z ≈ 0.43; r with PSS ≈ 0.68).
- Substance-related problems (BASIS-24 Substance Abuse z ≈ 1.75) and pain interference features that correlate positively with PSS.
- Circadian instability on wearables (low interdaily stability z ≈ -1.42, low amplitude z ≈ -1.10), which aligns with higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or moderated) PSS
- Very high general self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ 1.79), which in this dataset has a substantial negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63) and is a strong protective factor.
- Lower resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ -0.55 and -0.66), which are not indicative of high tonic physiological arousal in this sample.
- Some wearable-derived variability metrics near sample mean, and daytime HR patterns consistent with activity rather than persistent hyperarousal.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame and weighing of evidence
- Both participants have multiple signals that point above their respective population means. Participant 1’s strongest signals are very high depressive symptoms and very poor subjective sleep quality; however, several objective and behavioral buffers (adequate objective sleep duration, stable sleep timing, robust circadian measures, social exercise, preserved academics) reduce the likelihood that perceived stress is extremely elevated beyond the mean.
- Participant 2 shows an array of severe, converging risk indicators: objectively extremely short and highly variable sleep (median ≈ 3 hours), strong anxiety/emotional‑lability signals that in this sample have very high correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78 and emotional lability r ≈ 0.68), substance‑related problems, and circadian instability. Although Participant 2 has a strong protective factor (high self‑efficacy) and lower resting HR, the magnitude and multiplicity of PSS‑linked risk signals — especially the extreme objective sleep deprivation and several measures with large sample correlations to PSS — provide a stronger net signal of elevated perceived stress than the net signal for Participant 1.
- In short, Participant 1’s high depression and poor subjective sleep are important and indicate above‑mean stress, but are offset to a meaningful degree by objective sleep adequacy and psychosocial/behavioral buffers. Participant 2’s combination of extreme objective sleep loss/irregularity plus multiple strong PSS‑correlated affective and substance measures yields a stronger, less offset signal favoring a higher PSS relative to their cohort.

- High intradaily variability (IV = 0.64, Z = 2.29) indicating fragmented rest–activity patterns, which trends toward higher PSS (r ≈ 0.24).  
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 0.94) that could contribute to stress, albeit this has a small sample correlation with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Substantially elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11; z ≈ +1.98), a strong signal typically linked to higher perceived stress.  
- Modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 18; z ≈ +0.49), which correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28) and support higher stress.  
- Lower self-rated physical health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.2) and large evening HR deviations (e.g., +26 bpm at 5–6 pm, z ≈ 2.27) that may reflect episodic physiological activation or evening stressors.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- The summaries are calibrated to each study’s mean PSS. Participant 1’s summary explicitly concludes their overall profile leans toward lower perceived stress relative to their population mean (population mean = 21.42), driven strongly by very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 4, Z ≈ -0.94) and high self-efficacy (NGSE high, strong inverse correlate of PSS). These predictors have large sample-level associations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r ≈ 0.76; NGSE r ≈ -0.65), which strongly favor below-mean PSS despite severe sleep restriction.  
- Participant 2’s summary concludes perceived stress is near their population mean (population mean = 21.61). Although objective physiology and behavior are protective (good sleep quantity, robust circadian metrics, frequent exercise), subjective indicators that commonly elevate PSS (PSQI z ≈ +1.98 and CES-D above average) pull toward higher perceived stress. The profile is described as “near the mean,” not below it.

Conclusion
- Participant 1: inferred below their study mean PSS (strong indicators of lower stress despite sleep problems).  
- Participant 2: inferred near their study mean PSS, with subjective symptoms that raise the likelihood of higher stress relative to typical participants.

- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ 1.52), and sleep/circadian dysregulation: very late median sleep onset (~02:56), large night‑to‑night sleep start variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ 1.79), and unusually high nap rate (Z ≈ 2.4). These are known correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Wearable circadian signs of reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.9) and patterns of late‑night physiological arousal (small early‑night HR elevation near 1–2 AM) that are consistent with stress‑related arousal and irregular schedules.
- Although some protective features exist (relatively long median sleep duration, frequent exercise, low substance use, lower resting HR), the summary explicitly judges the net balance as “above the study population mean” for PSS.

- Pain and activity interference (PEG/PAPAS) with moderate positive correlations to PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47) and interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54) that can contribute to higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), which may reflect increased basal autonomic arousal in some people.
- Mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 5.5) is present though small in magnitude.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Participant 1’s risk signals are multiple and moderately to strongly elevated relative to their study population: subjective sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, large sleep timing variability, and a very high nap rate (Z ≈ 2.4). Although protective factors are present, the report explicitly concludes the net inference is PSS above that population’s mean (mean = 21.61).
- Participant 2 shows a mix of risk and strong protective factors. Risk factors include poor subjective sleep, some pain/interference, and interpersonal strain, but many of these are modest in magnitude (pain Zs around or below median). Crucially, Participant 2 has several strong protective features relative to their population: high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 1.41; NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS), very high interdaily stability and other robust circadian regularity metrics (Z ≈ 2.13 for interdaily stability), low emotional lability, long objective sleep duration (Z ≈ 1.47), and minimal substance problems. The integrated interpretation for Participant 2 was “near the population mean, likely at or slightly below it” (population mean = 21.38).
- Comparing the within‑population deviations: Participant 1’s elevated stress‑related Zs (notably PSQI Z ≈ 1.52, sleep variability Z ≈ 1.79, nap rate Z ≈ 2.4) indicate larger relative risk within their cohort than Participant 2’s net elevated risk signals, which are counterbalanced by several quite large protective Zs (interdaily stability Z ≈ 2.13, NGSE Z ≈ 1.41, long sleep Z ≈ 1.47).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their study mean on PSS, driven by multiple converging risk indicators tied to higher PSS in that sample.
- Participant 2 is inferred to be near or slightly below their study mean on PSS because strong protective factors (especially self‑efficacy and circadian regularity) appear to outweigh the moderate risk factors.
- Therefore, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their respective population).

- Very severe, convergent sleep signals: PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”), wearable median sleep ≈ 3 h/night, and extreme night‑to‑night sleep‑start variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82). PSQI and objective sleep disruption have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50). These are unusually large signals and tightly linked to higher PSS.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9 (mild anxiety) and BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z = 0.43; the GAD‑7–PSS correlation in this dataset is especially strong (r ≈ 0.78), so even moderate anxiety contributes substantially to inferred PSS.
- Substance‑related problems and pain interference: BASIS‑24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75 (relatively high) and pain scores that correlate positively with PSS—both plausible contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Circadian instability: Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -1.42), low amplitude (Z = -1.10), and lower 24‑h autocorrelation—all in directions associated with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Weight of evidence: Several of the strongest PSS‑correlated measures (GAD‑7, PSQI, emotional lability, circadian instability) point toward elevated stress; objectively extreme sleep disturbance is a particularly heavy signal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Moderate trait/symptom elevations: STAI = 47 (Z ≈ 0.56, “anxious”), CES‑D = 14 (near non‑clinical), lower happiness and self‑esteem (Z ≈ -0.53 and -0.59); these measures have modest positive/negative correlations with PSS in the sample (STAI–PSS ≈ 0.31, CES‑D–PSS ≈ 0.28).
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 6 (“Disturbed Sleep”), late median sleep start (~01:11), and elevated sleep‑start variability (SD ≈ 101 min, Z ≈ 0.4); these have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS.
- Circadian/physiologic markers consistent with stress: Low interdaily stability (Z = -1.48) and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.39); resting HR slightly above mean (Z ≈ 0.39). These point modestly upward for PSS but are not extreme.
- Behavioral/lifestyle: Some alcohol use and frequent solitary exercise (exercise is actually protective for many people; Z ≈ 1.07). No recreational drug use and preserved academic functioning—these are protective/neutral signals that limit how high inferred PSS is.
- Weight of evidence: Multiple moderate indicators point above mean but none are as extreme or as highly PSS‑correlated as the strongest signals in Participant 1.

Comparative, within‑study framing and weighing of evidence
- Both summaries place the participant’s inferred PSS above their study population mean. That said, Participant 1’s above‑mean inference is driven by several large, highly PSS‑correlated signals (extremely short objective sleep, very high PSQI, strong GAD‑7–PSS relation, elevated substance problems, circadian instability). The magnitudes (e.g., median sleep ≈ 3 h, sleep timing SD Z = 2.82, substance Z = 1.75) are substantial.
- Participant 2’s above‑mean inference is supported by several moderate signals (PSQI just over threshold, moderate trait anxiety, circadian irregularity) but these are smaller in magnitude and have weaker correlations with PSS in the sample. Participant 2 also shows more and stronger protective/neutral factors (regular exercise, preserved academic functioning, no substance misuse, higher socializing) that constrain inferred stress.
- Therefore, although both are inferred above their respective population means, the balance and magnitude of evidence indicate that Participant 1 is likely experiencing worse overall perceived stress than Participant 2.

- High pain/functional interference: PAPAS = 81 (Z = 0.93) — PAPAS correlates r = 0.53 with PSS.  
- Lower self-efficacy: NGSE Z = -0.62; NGSE correlates strongly with PSS (r = -0.69), so this is a potent risk indicator.  
- Objective signs of elevated physiological arousal during night: higher mesor and RHR (Z ≈ 0.6–0.7) and notable nocturnal HR elevations (Zs up to ≈1.38) — these HR features correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).  
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83), indicating irregular daily timing that is modestly associated with higher PSS.  
- Net interpretation in the description: several moderately-to-strongly correlated risk features point to above-mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and late, irregular sleep timing (median start ~02:12, SD ~108 min) — late/irregular timing and night-to-night variability are linked to higher PSS.  
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.67), indicating fragmentation of arousal/activity across the day; this metric correlates positively with PSS.  
- Reduced social/exercise engagement and lower momentary happiness — behavioral patterns that correlate with higher perceived stress.  
- Circadian amplitude reduced (Z = -1.21) and very low MESOR (Z = -1.95), which indicate circadian/coupling alterations that can be stress-related or reflect dysregulation.  
- Net interpretation in the description: a mix of behavioral/circadian risk indicators produces a mild above-mean PSS inference.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Both summaries conclude each participant is likely slightly above their study population mean PSS. The question is which one shows stronger/clearer evidence for higher perceived stress relative to peers.  
- Strength and number of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple comparatively strong risk markers that have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS (high PSQI, high PAPAS, low NGSE with r = -0.69, nocturnal HR elevations). These features are direct, clinically relevant, and convergent (subjective pain + very poor sleep + lower coping self-efficacy + physiological nocturnal arousal).  
- Participant 2 has several notable risk features (late/irregular sleep timing, elevated IV, reduced amplitude/MESOR) but also stronger protective/contradictory signals (low resting HR Z = -1.18 suggesting low chronic arousal/greater fitness, adequate median sleep duration ≈7 h, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem). Participant 2’s subjective sleep disturbance is much milder (PSQI = 7) than Participant 1’s (PSQI = 15.5).  
- Relative effect sizes and correlations: Participant 1’s key predictors include measures with larger sample correlations to PSS (e.g., NGSE r = -0.69; PSQI/PAPAS r ≈ 0.53) and larger deviations from the mean on clinically salient measures (very high PSQI, high PAPAS, nocturnal HR Z up to ≈1.38). Participant 2’s strongest deviations (very low MESOR Z = -1.95 and reduced amplitude Z = -1.21) suggest circadian/behavioral dysregulation but are paired with objective cardiovascular signs that typically indicate lower chronic stress.  
- Taken together, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 has a more coherent, multi-domain pattern pointing to higher perceived stress relative to their sample, whereas Participant 2’s profile is more mixed (behavioral/circadian risk but physiological and psychosocial protections) and therefore less likely to reflect as high a PSS elevation.

7,48013,15,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; z = +0.67; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.53) in this sample.
- Extremely short median nightly sleep (≈4 h 22 min) and large night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z = +0.89) and sleep onset time (SD z = +0.34) — short/irregular sleep commonly co‑occurs with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS‑24 Interpersonal Relationships z = +2.34), which are a contextual risk factor for ongoing perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian regularity and blunted rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24‑h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude) consistent with disrupted daily structure seen with higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55; z = +1.35) and elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 19; z = +0.59). Both are positively associated with PSS in the sample and are strong psychosocial predictors of perceived stress.
- Marked circadian irregularity (interdaily stability z = −1.48; 24‑h autocorrelation z = −1.54) and reduced amplitude (z = −1.08), which in the sample are associated with higher PSS.
- Substantial night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep duration SD z = +1.13) and delayed/variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:04 AM; z = +0.80), which align with stress‑related sleep disruption.
- Low subjective well‑being indicators (low happiness z = −1.61; low self‑esteem z = −1.43), which further support higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Participant 1: overall inference in the description is “near the population mean PSS with a modest tilt toward above the mean.” Key stress signals are primarily sleep‑ and circadian‑related plus interpersonal strain, but strong protective signals (very low current anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, near‑average self‑efficacy, lower resting HR) weigh against a strong elevation in PSS.
- Participant 2: the description characterizes the participant as “most plausibly above the population mean PSS.” The profile contains multiple convergent psychosocial (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, low well‑being) and objective rhythm/sleep markers that more consistently predict higher PSS, with fewer and weaker protective factors (exercise, limited substance use, near‑normal median sleep) that do not fully counterbalance the distress signals.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows a broader and more consistent set of indicators that are positively associated with higher perceived stress (notably trait anxiety and depressive symptoms plus strong circadian disruption and sleep variability).
- Participant 1 has some important stress‑related features (severe short/irregular sleep and interpersonal strain) but also several strong protective/mitigating indicators (very low anxiety, low pain, low emotional lability, average self‑efficacy, lower resting HR), and the holisitic assessment placed them near the study mean with only a modest tilt above it.

- Wearable-derived sleep/circadian irregularity: very late median sleep start (02:54), modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m, z = -0.76), large night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 172 min, z = 1.62). These features have positive correlations with PSS in the study (sleep variability r ≈ 0.13).
- Elevated intradaily variability of heart‑rate rhythm (0.73, z = 1.30) and relatively low 24‑hour autocorrelation (z = -0.87) indicating fragmented/inconsistent daily structure (intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15 with PSS).
- Slightly increased daytime napping (z = 1.49) consistent with compensatory sleep, which can accompany higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self‑report indicators of high distress: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 21, z = 2.04; GAD‑7 r with PSS ≈ 0.71), very poor sleep quality (PSQI = 18, z = 1.49; PSQI r with PSS ≈ 0.41), high pain/pain interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS z ≈ 2.28), and high emotional lability (z = 2.42).
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -2.29), a trait known to amplify perceived stress.
- Objective sleep/circadian corroboration of distress: extremely short median sleep (3 h 42 min) with large variability (SD ≈ 173 min), low interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability, dampened HR rhythm (amplitude and mesor z ≈ -0.9 to -1.14).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations (positive at 12–2am) that have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), consistent with physiological arousal linked to higher perceived stress.
- Although there are some protective features (minimal substance use, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), they are outweighed by the multiple strong risk indicators.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each profile is reported relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is interpreted as likely below their population mean PSS (population mean 21.6) based largely on strong low‑distress self‑report and wellbeing markers; the objective irregularity metrics pointing upward are modestly correlated with PSS and were judged insufficient to place them above their sample mean.
- Participant 2 is explicitly interpreted as above their population mean PSS (population mean 20.33) because multiple high‑Z, strongly PSS‑related self‑report measures (severe anxiety, very poor sleep, pain, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy) are corroborated by objective severe sleep restriction and circadian disruption.
- The strength and number of high‑signal indicators for Participant 2 (large z‑scores on anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability, and objective extreme sleep loss) are substantially greater than the comparatively modest objective signals favoring higher PSS in Participant 1 (mainly circadian/sleep timing variability with small-to-moderate correlations with PSS). Participant 1’s dominant signals are low distress on multiple self‑report scales, which argue for lower perceived stress relative to their cohort.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows multiple, strongly interrelated indicators (both self‑report and objective) that are known to have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in their sample and that collectively point to elevated perceived stress relative to their population mean.
- Participant 1 shows mostly low subjective distress and wellbeing markers that point to lower-than‑average perceived stress in their sample; the objective sleep/circadian irregularities are weaker predictors in this dataset and do not dominate the profile.

23,89652,17,28,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean = 21.6)
- Marked circadian and sleep irregularity: very late median sleep start (~02:54), modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m, z = -0.76), and high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 172 min, z = 1.62). These patterns are commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Fragmented/inconsistent daily physiology: elevated intradaily variability of heart‑rate rhythm (z = 1.30) and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (z = -0.87), indicating unstable daily structure that modestly correlates with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.13–0.15).
- Slightly elevated daytime napping (z = 1.49), which can indicate compensatory sleep and correlate with stress-related sleep disruption.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.21)
- Substantially poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically elevated), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep: median nightly duration ≈ 4 h 21 m, a severe reduction in sleep opportunity associated with greater perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: large positive overnight heart‑rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm), with the 1–2 AM deviation showing a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- Irregular sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), which can contribute to perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s objective risk signals (late/variable sleep and circadian fragmentation) are present but their associations with PSS in this study are small (r ≈ 0.13–0.15), so these indicators provide only modest upward pressure on predicted PSS relative to the study mean. Subjective and trait measures (low depression/anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, PSQI in “good” range) are consistently favorable and weigh strongly toward lower PSS relative to that study’s mean.
- Participant 2 shows very strong sleep-related risk signals (severe short sleep, high PSQI, nocturnal HR elevations) that have moderate correlations with PSS and would push inferred PSS upward relative to that study mean. However, Participant 2 also has very strong protective trait/daytime signals that are highly predictive of lower PSS in that sample (notably minimal GAD‑7, r ≈ 0.77 with PSS, and higher NGSE, r ≈ -0.65). The study text explicitly weights these trait/daytime predictors more heavily than the sleep signals when inferring overall PSS for Participant 2.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- For Participant 1, the primary upward pressures on PSS are relatively weak predictors (small correlations) and coexist with robust, consistent subjective wellbeing and low symptom scores. The summary explicitly concludes Participant 1 is likely at-or-below the sample mean, with only modest risk from irregular sleep.
- For Participant 2, sleep-related indicators that correlate moderately with PSS are strong and concerning, but very strong protective trait/daytime measures (especially very low GAD‑7 and relatively high self‑efficacy) carry large, empirically stronger negative associations with PSS in that sample. The study summary likewise concludes Participant 2 is likely below that sample’s mean PSS, largely because the protective trait signals have larger, more predictive correlations with PSS than the sleep signals.

Conclusion
- Although both participants are inferred to be below their respective study means, the net predictive evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely to have a lower PSS (relative to Participant 2’s population) than Participant 1 is relative to Participant 1’s population. The decisive factor is that Participant 2’s very low anxiety and higher self‑efficacy are strongly predictive of reduced PSS in that sample, whereas Participant 1’s risk signals (sleep/circadian irregularity) — though present — have only small associations with PSS and the participant’s subjective wellbeing signals are less decisively predictive than Participant 2’s protective traits.

- Large, clinically meaningful self‑report risk signals:
  - Severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 21; Z ≈ 2.04) — strong positive correlate of PSS (r ≈ 0.71).
  - Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ 1.49) and extreme objective sleep restriction (median sleep ~3 h 42 min; night‑to‑night SD ≈ 173 min) — sleep loss/fragmentation strongly relate to higher PSS.
  - High emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ 2.42) and elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3 / PAPAS Z ≈ 2.28) — these large Zs point toward substantial distress.
  - Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29), which is negatively correlated with PSS and would amplify perceived stress.
- Physiologic corroboration:
  - Wearable circadian metrics show low interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability, consistent with fragmented rest–activity rhythms associated with higher stress.
  - Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations around sleep onset (early night) that have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), suggesting physiologic arousal linked to stress/insomnia.
- Net balance: multiple large-magnitude risk indicators (several Zs > 2) with only a few modest protective factors (low substance use, preserved interpersonal function, low resting HR), so overall profile points clearly above the sample mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Mild-to-moderate risk signals:
  - Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.27) and mild depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z ≈ 0.18), which correlate positively with PSS (but with small effect sizes).
  - Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 6) despite objectively sufficient sleep duration; late sleep timing and some night‑to‑night timing variability could reduce restorative sleep and slightly raise perceived stress.
  - Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.74) and mild intradaily fragmentation (Z ≈ 0.32), and some early‑morning HR deviations that weakly correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).
  - Slightly lower recent happiness and health satisfaction (small negative Zs) that tend to co-occur with higher PSS.
- Protective/muting factors:
  - Strong psychosocial resources (self‑esteem Z ≈ 1.38), frequent exercise (Z > 1 on exercise items), social supports, low substance use and generally healthy physiology (adequate sleep duration, low resting HR).
  - Overall, risk signals are small-to-moderate and are substantially offset by larger protective signals, producing an inferred PSS near (possibly slightly above) the population mean rather than markedly elevated.

Comparative, within-sample-frame reasoning
- Both participant summaries are relative to their own sample means (P1 mean = 20.33; P2 mean = 21.6). P1 is explicitly interpreted as above that mean; P2 is interpreted as near that mean (perhaps slightly above).
- Magnitude and number of risk indicators: Participant 1 shows multiple large-magnitude risk indicators (several Zs ≈ 2 or greater) across anxiety, sleep, emotion regulation, pain, and self‑efficacy. Participant 2 shows mainly small-to-moderate deviations (Zs typically < 1) in risk domains, and several comparatively large protective signals (self‑esteem, exercise).
- Physiologic corroboration: P1’s objective data (very short sleep, large variability, nighttime HR arousal correlated moderately with PSS) strongly reinforce the high self‑report distress. P2’s objective data are mixed but less extreme (adequate sleep duration, milder circadian irregularity, weaker HR–PSS correlations).
- Given the size, consistency, and clinical severity of P1’s risk signals (including severe anxiety and extreme sleep restriction) versus P2’s milder, more balanced profile, the balance of evidence indicates a higher overall perceived stress for Participant 1.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) despite adequate objective sleep duration; late sleep timing (~00:57) and night-to-night timing variability (SD ≈ 63 min) that can reduce restorative sleep value.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.74) and mildly increased intradaily fragmentation (Z ≈ 0.32) — circadian irregularity weakly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Small signals of lower happiness and health satisfaction (Zs ≈ -0.53 and -0.95) that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Counterpoints: multiple relatively large protective factors — high self‑esteem (Z = 1.38), frequent exercise (Z > 1), low resting HR, good objective sleep duration (median 7 h 38 min; Z ≈ 0.56), low substance use — all of which are associated with lower PSS. The summary explicitly rates this participant as “near the mean, possibly slightly above,” with protections tipping the balance toward near-mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1’s risk indicators are larger in magnitude and more PSS-relevant (very short objective sleep, high PSQI, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations) and are described as having moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample. The summary explicitly concludes “above the population mean” with moderate confidence.
- Participant 2’s risk indicators are generally small-to-moderate and are substantially offset by strong protective factors (notably high self‑esteem, frequent exercise, adequate objective sleep). The summary concludes “near the mean, possibly slightly above,” indicating a much smaller net elevation relative to that sample’s mean.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1 shows multiple large, concordant risk signals that in their sample meaningfully predict higher PSS; Participant 2 shows only mild risk signals that are largely counterbalanced by robust protective factors. Thus Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their respective study population).

- Elevated tonic physiological arousal: resting heart rate (RHR Z = 0.86) and mesor (Z = 0.61) are above the study mean and correlate positively with PSS in the sample, consistent with modestly greater autonomic activation.
- Greater within-day variability in heart-rate (intradaily variability Z = 0.53), which correlates with PSS and can indicate behavioral/physiological wear-and-tear.
- Later sleep timing and somewhat shortened sleep (median sleep start 01:32; duration 6 h 48 min, Z = -0.47), which are often associated with higher perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness (Z = -0.53), an affective signal that aligns with greater perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; Z = 0.67) and very short median objective sleep (4 h 22 min) — strong stress correlates in this dataset (PSQI r ≈ 0.53 with PSS).
- High night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; Z = 0.89) and variable sleep onset (SD = 204 min), indicating unstable sleep that typically accompanies elevated perceived stress.
- Substantial interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 2.34), a salient psychosocial risk factor for ongoing perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian regularity and dampened rhythm amplitude (interdaily stability and autocorrelation low; cosinor amplitude Z = -0.84), consistent with disrupted behavioral structure and higher allostatic burden.

Comparative, within-population-frame considerations
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study population mean PSS: Participant 1’s integrated summary is described as “near the population mean, slightly tending toward below-mean” (population mean = 21.61). Participant 2’s integrated summary is described as “near the population mean, with a modest tilt toward being above the mean” (population mean = 21.29).
- Magnitude and extremity of stress-related indicators differ: Participant 1’s stress-consistent signs are mostly modest (physiological elevations and late sleep timing) and are counterbalanced by several psychosocial and sleep-related protective factors (good PSQI, high self-esteem, low depressive symptoms, strong circadian regularity). Participant 2 displays stronger, more extreme stress-related signals (very short and highly variable sleep, very high interpersonal-strain z-score, and pronounced circadian irregularity) despite some protective markers (low reported anxiety, low resting HR).
- Z-score magnitudes and the number of converging stress-related indicators are greater for Participant 2 (e.g., extreme sleep deprivation and interpersonal-strain z-scores) than for Participant 1 (mostly moderate physiological z-scores and protective psychosocial z-scores).

Overall weighing of evidence
- Participant 1: Mixed profile with modest physiological signals of arousal but several psychosocial and sleep-related buffers; overall inferred PSS ≈ population mean or slightly below.
- Participant 2: Multiple, relatively large-magnitude indicators pointing toward elevated perceived stress (especially severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance and interpersonal strain), and the integrated summary explicitly tilts above the population mean.

Conclusion
Given the stronger, more numerous, and higher-magnitude stress-linked signals for Participant 2 (notably extreme short/variable sleep and high interpersonal strain) versus Participant 1’s modest physiological elevations counterbalanced by protective psychosocial factors, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

- Disturbed subjective sleep and pain interference: PSQI = 8.5 and elevated PEG-3/PAPAS (PEG-3 r ≈ 0.43; PAPAS r ≈ 0.47), both positively associated with PSS.  
- Nocturnal/evening physiological arousal: Large overnight heart-rate deviations (~+14 bpm around midnight–2am) that are correlated with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40), supporting active physiological arousal related to stress.  
- Sleep variability/fragmentation: High night-to-night sleep variability (SD 199 min) which is associated with greater subjective stress.

- Disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), a strong correlate of higher PSS.  
- Trait anxiety and negative affect: STAI–Trait = 44 (z ≈ +0.27) and lower happiness/health satisfaction—both align with higher PSS.  
- Late, somewhat short and variable sleep: Median sleep ≈ 6 h 51 min (z ≈ −0.42), late sleep onset (~00:59) and sleep start SD ≈ 89 min, factors associated with higher stress.  
- High evening/late-night internet use (z ≈ +2.19) which can exacerbate late sleep and stress.  
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular activation: resting HR and mesor elevated (z ≈ +0.74–+0.79), consistent with low–moderate autonomic activation linked to stress.

Comparative within-population reasoning
- Both participant descriptions conclude each person is above their respective study mean PSS. The question is which one appears worse relative to their sample.
- Strength of predictive signals: Participant 1 has multiple strong survey predictors tightly correlated with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77 and elevated emotional lability), plus corroborating nocturnal HR spikes that also correlate reasonably with PSS. Those are concentrated, concordant, and clinically meaningful (GAD-7 at screening threshold, PSQI > clinical cutoff, substantial pain interference).
- Participant 2 also shows clear stress-related signals (PSQI high, late/short sleep, heavy evening internet use, modestly elevated resting HR), but several strong protective/offsetting markers are present (low depressive symptoms, good academic functioning, high interdaily stability / circadian regularity). Many of P2’s physiological markers point to preserved diurnal rhythm rather than pathological nocturnal arousal.
- Overall balance: P1’s indicators combine clinically relevant anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability, and marked nocturnal HR arousal—all of which are reported to correlate substantially with PSS in that dataset—whereas P2’s elevations are more moderate and counterbalanced by clearer protective factors.

- Mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = +0.46), which also correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Sleep timing and circadian irregularity: extremely late median sleep onset (~03:45 AM), high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 173 min; Z = +1.65), and low 24‑h autocorrelation (0.19; Z = -1.12). These features are associated with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Pronounced late‑afternoon/evening heart‑rate surge (5–6 pm deviation +29.45; Z = +2.76), indicating episodes of physiological arousal that have been linked to stress-like states.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (protective signals relevant to comparison)
- Very low substance use (strong negative Zs), which is associated with lower PSS in this sample.
- Low resting heart rate and lower MESOR (Zs ≈ -0.56 to -0.83), suggesting greater baseline physiological resilience.
- Frequent social exercise (Z ≈ +1.23) and modestly higher happiness/health satisfaction (Z ≈ +0.55, +0.22), both buffering against perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5; “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates fairly strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Severely shortened objective sleep (median ~3 h 30 m) and very late sleep timing (~03:37 AM) — extreme sleep restriction is strongly stress‑related.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG‑3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43), with pain measures showing moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations during typical sleep hours (hourly HR deviations Z up to ≈ +0.67) and reduced circadian robustness (lower amplitude and autocorrelation) — these physiological indicators have moderate sample correlations with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (protective signals relevant to comparison)
- Low self‑reported generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 4.5; Z ≈ -0.85). GAD‑7 has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so this is a substantial protective factor.
- High general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86; r ≈ -0.64) and low emotional lability (BASIS‑24 emotional lability Z ≈ -0.97; r ≈ 0.65), both of which are strongly associated with lower PSS in the cohort.
- Resting HR and daily rhythm stability metrics are near average, not strongly pointing to dysregulation beyond the nocturnal arousal.

Comparative weighing (explicitly within each study’s mean frame)
- Both participants were inferred to be above their respective population mean PSS in their writeups. We must compare the relative strength, number, and sample‑relevance of risk vs protective signals in each case.
- Participant 1: strongest risks are elevated depressive symptoms (moderate Z) and striking evening HR surge (very large Z = +2.76) plus circadian irregularity and variable/late sleep. However many of the highest‑weight correlates with PSS in the sample (e.g., anxiety, depression) have only small‑to‑moderate sample correlations here, and Participant 1 also presents several robust protective signals (very low substance use, good baseline cardiovascular markers, social exercise, modestly higher happiness) that substantially temper the net stress inference.
- Participant 2: displays multiple severe, directly stress‑relevant abnormalities with moderate‑to‑strong sample correlations to PSS: very short objective sleep (extreme magnitude), very high PSQI, elevated pain (PEG‑3), and nocturnal physiological arousal. Although Participant 2 has unusually strong protective self‑report factors (low GAD‑7, high self‑efficacy, low emotional lability), many of the risk signals (especially extreme sleep restriction and high PSQI and pain) are large in magnitude and are shown to correlate moderately‑strongly with PSS in the sample.

Conclusion (which participant likely has the higher PSS)
- On balance, Participant 2 shows a greater concentration of large, PSS‑relevant risk signals (extreme objective sleep restriction, very disturbed subjective sleep, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations) whose sample correlations with PSS are moderate to strong. Participant 1 has important risks (notably depressive symptoms and marked evening HR spikes) but also a set of strong protective/lifestyle signals that soften the net inference.
- Therefore, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

23,87032,17,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically significant) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep: median nightly duration ≈ 4 h 21 min — chronic short sleep tends to increase perceived stress.
- Irregular sleep timing: large sleep start SD (~123 min) which can contribute to stress and poor recovery.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (1–2 AM +14.62 bpm, z > 1) and the 1–2 AM HR deviation correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- These sleep/nocturnal signals could push this person’s PSS upward relative to their population if they exert strong daytime effects.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES-D Z ≈ +1.53 (substantially above the sample mean), and CES-D is positively associated with PSS.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI modestly high and STAI correlates positively with PSS.
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI Z ≈ +1.52 (poor sleep quality).
- Late and irregular sleep timing: median sleep start ≈ 02:00 and high start-time SD (Z ≈ +1.36).
- Marked circadian/rhythm disruption: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.15), very low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), and high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.44) — pattern linked to worse stress outcomes.
- Physiological arousal: elevated MESOR (Z ≈ +1.56) and higher resting heart rate (Z ≈ +1.34), both positively correlated with PSS.
- Several of these indicators have moderate-to-large z-scores and consistent direction, yielding converging evidence for PSS above that study’s mean.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1 is described as overall likely below their population mean PSS: key protective signals (very low GAD-7, high NGSE) are strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ −0.65) and provide strong evidence toward lower perceived stress despite notable sleep-related risks.
- Participant 2 is described as likely above their population mean PSS: multiple measures (CES-D, PSQI, MESOR, intradaily variability, late/variable sleep) are elevated with several z-scores ≈ +1.4 to +1.6 and consistent direction toward greater psychological and physiological activation.
- Weighting both the magnitude of associations and the number/direction of risk indicators within each participant’s study frame, Participant 2 shows more numerous and larger deviations in measures that correlate with higher PSS, whereas Participant 1’s strongest, most highly correlated indicators point toward lower PSS despite some sleep-specific risks.

Decision
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) relative to their respective study populations.

17,18111,19,28,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.6)
- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES‑D = 27 (z = +1.42, “Depressed”) and STAI‑Trait = 48 (z = +0.66, “anxious”) — these self-report elevations are consistent with above-mean perceived stress in that study (CES‑D and STAI have moderate positive correlations with PSS: CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity: PSQI = 8 (z = +0.59), late sleep timing (~01:19), high night‑to‑night variability (SD ≈ 113 min), and high nap frequency (z = +2.27) all point toward fragmented/poor sleep patterns that commonly accompany higher stress.  
- Wearable markers of dysregulated physiology timing: substantially reduced circadian amplitude (z = -1.48), low interdaily stability (z = -1.40), and pronounced evening heart‑rate elevations (8–9pm mean deviation z ≈ +1.85) suggest physiological arousal/irregular rhythms that align with elevated perceived stress.  
- Behavioral correlates: reduced restorative leisure and higher internet usage are consistent with coping/time‑use patterns seen with higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.12)
- Very high anxiety strongly tied to PSS: GAD‑7 = 16.5 (z = +1.25, “severe”) and in this study GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS (r = 0.81). This is a high‑weight indicator of above‑mean perceived stress.  
- Very poor subjective sleep strongly tied to PSS: PSQI = 16 (z = +0.83) and PSQI r = 0.51 with PSS — another high‑weight contributor.  
- Low self‑efficacy and pain interference: NGSE z = -0.62 (NGSE r = -0.66 with PSS) and PEG/PAPAS correlations ~0.44–0.48; both are substantial study‑level predictors of higher PSS.  
- Elevated baseline physiological arousal: resting HR 79.8 bpm (z = +1.53) and mesor z = +1.49, consistent with sustained arousal that aligns with higher stress.  
- Wearable sleep/behavioral disruption: very short median wearable sleep (2 h 31 min, though possibly undercounted), late and highly variable sleep timing (start ~01:37, SD z ≈ +0.98) which concords with high PSQI and anxiety.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Strength/weight of indicators: Several of Participant 2’s top indicators (GAD‑7, PSQI, NGSE, resting HR) have strong study‑level correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD‑7 r = 0.81; NGSE r = -0.66; PSQI r = 0.51). Participant 1’s strongest symptom signals (CES‑D, STAI) are elevated but, in this study, have more modest correlations with PSS (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Thus Participant 2’s high‑weight predictors of PSS are both more extreme and more predictive in their dataset than Participant 1’s predictors are in theirs.  
- Physiological corroboration: Participant 2 shows elevated resting HR/mesor (z ≈ +1.5), consistent with sustained arousal and reinforcing the self‑report indicators. Participant 1 shows notable evening HR deviations and circadian amplitude loss, but resting HR is normal — a mixed physiological picture.  
- Convergence and magnitude: Participant 2 has multiple strongly convergent indicators (severe anxiety, very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy, elevated resting HR) that, given their large study‑level associations with PSS, point more convincingly to a higher PSS relative to their sample mean than Participant 1’s pattern does relative to theirs. Participant 1 has important signals (depression, sleep/circadian irregularity) but fewer high‑weight predictors and more protective/neutral signals (normal resting HR, adequate average sleep duration, intact academic functioning).

Conclusion (weighing evidence)
Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress relative to their study population mean.

15,28327,15,24,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s sample frame)
- Strong, large self-report psychopathology elevations: CES‑D = 33 (Z = 2.05, classified as depressed) and STAI–Trait = 58 (Z = 1.65, classified as anxious). These are large deviations from the sample mean and are established positive predictors of PSS in that sample.  
- Low self-esteem and low happiness (Rosenberg Z ≈ -1.71; happiness Z ≈ -1.61), which are negatively correlated with PSS and imply reduced resilience.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ 1.05), and physiological signs of within-day arousal/fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ 1.02 and pronounced evening HR deviations up to Z ≈ 2.24) that are associated with higher PSS.  
- The summary explicitly concludes perceived stress above the population mean (PSS mean = 21.61), and several high‑Z psychological measures drive that inference.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ 0.67) and high pain/functional interference (PAPAS Z ≈ 0.93); both correlate fairly strongly with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.53) and push toward higher perceived stress.  
- Below-average self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.62), and NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so this is another contributor to elevated PSS.  
- Wearable signals consistent with stress: elevated mesor and resting HR (Z ≈ 0.7 and 0.61) and nocturnal HR deviations (Zs up to ≈1.38), plus reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83), which in this dataset associate with higher PSS.  
- The integrated interpretation also concludes perceived stress above the population mean (PSS mean = 21.29).

Comparative weighting (taking each description relative to its own population mean)
- Magnitude of deviations: Participant 1 shows very large psychological deviations (CES‑D Z = 2.05; STAI Z = 1.65) and large evening HR deviations (up to Z ≈ 2.24). Participant 2’s largest Zs are more moderate (PAPAS Z ≈ 0.93; nocturnal HR up to ≈1.38; PSQI Z ≈ 0.67). The biggest single Zs are in Participant 1, indicating more extreme departures from that sample’s norms.  
- Predictive strength of features: Participant 2’s elevated features (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE) have relatively strong sample correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.53 and r ≈ -0.69), which increases their diagnostic weight. However, Participant 2 also has a notably below-average GAD‑7 (Z ≈ -0.76) — and anxiety in this sample is very strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.76), so that mitigating factor substantially reduces the net predicted PSS for Participant 2.  
- Net balance: Participant 1’s profile is dominated by very large elevations in depression and trait anxiety plus strong evening physiological arousal; Participant 2 has several moderately strong stress-related signals but also several meaningful mitigators (low GAD‑7, long objective sleep, low intradaily variability). On balance the extreme psychological symptom burden in Participant 1 (especially CES‑D Z > 2 and STAI Z > 1.5) likely corresponds to a larger increase in perceived stress above that sample’s mean than the more mixed/moderate pattern seen in Participant 2.

6,24029,20,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong self-report predictors with large sample-level associations to PSS:
  - GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety). In this sample GAD-7 has a very large correlation with PSS (r = 0.77), making this a highly relevant indicator.
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 score z = 0.93; r = 0.67) — a strong correlate of higher PSS.
  - Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 13.5; r = 0.49) — markedly disturbed sleep that commonly amplifies perceived stress.
  - Lower general self-efficacy (NGSE z = −0.62; r = −0.66) — a potent negative predictor of PSS.
- Wearable / behavioral features consistent with higher stress:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (resting HR z = 1.31; MESOR z = 1.19), which can reflect higher baseline autonomic arousal.
  - High night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.12) and relatively late sleep timing — patterns associated with stress and reduced resilience.
- Offsetting/tempering indicators are weaker or less directly predictive in this sample (median sleep ~7 h, low intradaily variability, modest circadian amplitude), and several wearable circadian metrics have weak or inconsistent correlations with PSS. Overall, high-impact self-reports (with strong r values) point toward above-mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Self-report risk indicators:
  - CES-D = 21 (z ≈ 0.8; “Depressed”) and STAI = 50 (z ≈ 0.86; “anxious”). Both correlate with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28 and r ≈ 0.31 respectively), but these correlations are modest compared with some P1 predictors.
  - Marginally disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6) and low self-esteem (RSES z = −1.29; r ≈ −0.15) may contribute to higher perceived stress.
- Wearable/circadian indicators consistent with higher stress:
  - High intradaily variability (z = 1.09; r ≈ 0.15) and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (z = −0.53) — signs of circadian fragmentation associated with higher PSS.
  - Some sleep timing variability and slightly short median sleep (6 h 46 min; z ≈ −0.52).
- Important protective/mitigating features:
  - Frequent exercise (z ≈ 1.07–1.58), absence of substance use, relatively low resting HR (z ≈ −0.42), and above-average self-reported happiness (z ≈ 0.55). These behaviors and physiological signs are plausibly stress-buffering and could reduce perceived stress despite affective symptoms.
- Net picture: clinically relevant symptom elevations exist but their sample correlations with PSS are modest; several robust protective factors are present and likely mitigate overall perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population mean PSS. However, the strength and relevance of predictors differ:
  - Participant 1’s elevated indicators (anxiety, emotional lability, poor PSQI, low self-efficacy) are tied to relatively large sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.77, BASIS-24 r = 0.67, NGSE r = −0.66, PSQI r = 0.49). These are high-impact predictors that collectively point to a substantive elevation in perceived stress relative to their sample mean (21.08).
  - Participant 2 shows elevated depressive and trait anxiety symptoms, but those measures have more modest correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). In addition, Participant 2 has several clear protective factors (regular exercise, no substance use, low resting HR, higher happiness) that likely attenuate perceived stress relative to their population mean (21.59).
- Wearable signals: P1 has higher resting HR and sleep variability (risk-consistent), whereas P2’s wearable risks (intradaily variability, circadian irregularity) exist but have smaller sample correlations to PSS; P2 also has physiological markers of fitness that are protective.
- Taking effect sizes, correlation strengths, and direction of multiple indicators into account, Participant 1’s profile contains more and stronger predictors of elevated perceived stress, while Participant 2’s profile is more mixed due to substantive protective factors counterbalancing moderate symptom elevations.

23,43794,17,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5), which in this study correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep duration (median ≈ 4 h 21 m) and large variability in sleep timing—behavioral sleep restriction/irregularity that often raises perceived stress.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (z > 1; 1–2 AM deviation r ≈ 0.46 with PSS), suggesting overnight physiological arousal linked to higher PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35), a strong self-report predictor of higher PSS in the sample.
- Elevated resting heart rate (70.8 bpm, Z = +1.50), consistent with greater autonomic arousal associated with higher perceived stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8) plus large night-to-night variability in sleep timing/duration.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.7 to −1.8), and increased intradaily fragmentation—objective circadian/physiological signs that map onto higher PSS.
- Lower self-esteem/happiness indices, adding psychosocial weight toward elevated perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each profile is already interpreted relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be below that study’s mean PSS (21.21) because very strong protective signals (very low GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.77 and higher self-efficacy r ≈ −0.65) outweigh the sleep-related risk signals (which have only moderate correlations with PSS).
- Participant 2 is inferred to be above that study’s mean PSS (21.6) because multiple converging signals—elevated trait anxiety, elevated RHR, disturbed subjective sleep, and strong objective circadian irregularity—point toward higher perceived stress relative to that population.
- The two population means are nearly identical (21.21 vs 21.6), so the within-population inferences are directly comparable: Participant 1 is likely below their mean, Participant 2 is likely above theirs.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed but overall leaning below-mean PSS because the strongest predictors in this dataset (very low trait anxiety and relatively high self-efficacy) point downward and have larger correlations with PSS than the sleep/arousal signals that point upward.
- Participant 2: multiple consistent signals (trait anxiety, elevated RHR, circadian disruption, subjective sleep problems) point upward; mitigating factors are weaker or less directly tied to PSS in the dataset.
- Therefore, Participant 2 more plausibly has the higher overall perceived stress score.

- Elevated affective symptoms: CES-D = 26 and STAI = 55 (both ≈ +1.3 SD) — these measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and such elevations commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.  
- Subjective affect and interpersonal strain: very low happiness and trust (z ≈ -1.6 and -2.07) and below-average health satisfaction—self-report indicators that align with higher stress.  
- Sleep timing irregularity and circadian disruption: late median sleep onset (02:38), high night-to-night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.2; start SD z ≈ +0.9), reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.82) and reduced circadian amplitude — features associated with greater perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated hourly heart-rate deviations in late evening/early night (positive deviations with z’s up to +2.25), consistent with nighttime arousal that often relates to higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population)
- Strongly linked anxiety symptoms: GAD-7 = 14.5 (z ≈ +0.9) and in this sample GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.80), meaning this measure is highly predictive of higher perceived stress in this cohort.  
- Severe objective sleep restriction and disruption: extremely short median nightly sleep (2 h 19 m; z ≈ -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (start SD z ≈ +1.16) — these are robust stress-linked sleep markers. PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- Marked physiological arousal and circadian flattening tied to PSS: high resting heart rate (RHR ≈ 81 bpm, z ≈ +1.67), low circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.57), very low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.34) and elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +1.23). Nocturnal HR elevations around midnight–2 AM (+8–9 bpm) are present and those nightly deviations correlate positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Co-occurring emotional lability and pain interference that correlate with PSS (BASIS emotional lability r ≈ 0.66; pain-related burden r ≈ 0.47), adding convergent evidence for higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective sample means, but the strength and predictive value of the signals differ. Participant 1’s strongest elevations are depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both >1 SD); those measures, however, have only modest correlations with PSS in that study (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Participant 1 also displays several protective/mitigating features (longer objective sleep than cohort mean, low resting heart rate/mesor, regular exercise, stronger social/leisure engagement, good academic functioning) that could reduce perceived stress despite affective symptom elevations.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple, convergent signals that are both severe and strongly tied to PSS in that cohort: GAD-7 with very high sample-level correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.80); objectively extremely short and very variable sleep; substantial nocturnal heart-rate elevations and an overall elevated RHR and flattened amplitude — many of these physiological and sleep metrics in Participant 2 have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS. Participant 2’s only notable protective factor is a modestly higher self-efficacy score; this is unlikely, per the summary, to offset the large, multi-domain stress signals.  
- On balance, Participant 2’s profile contains more extreme and more PSS-predictive disturbances (especially severe sleep restriction, strong anxiety-PSS linkage, marked nocturnal physiological arousal) than Participant 1’s profile, which is a mix of elevated affective symptoms plus several protective physiological/behavioral features.

Conclusion
Based on the relative strength, severity, and sample-level predictive value of the signal clusters, Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56), modestly associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83), a clinical-level indicator that typically co-occurs with and amplifies perceived stress.
- Low current happiness (Z = -1.61) and below-average self-esteem (RSES Z = -0.31), both aligning with higher stress profiles.
- Wearable signs of mild physiological arousal/fragmentation: resting HR mildly elevated (Z = 0.65, r ≈ 0.13) and higher intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.81, r ≈ 0.15), which modestly associate with increased perceived stress.
- Pattern of slightly reduced interdaily stability with higher intradaily fragmentation, indicating within-day irregularity linked to higher stress.

Counterpoints for Participant 1 (potential buffers)
- Long and stable objective sleep duration (median ≈ 8h10m, Z = 1.22; low night-to-night variability Z = -0.92) — weakly protective (r ≈ -0.07).
- Regular exercise (Z = 1.07) and moderate social time (Z = 0.95), low substance use, and high music engagement (Z = 2.06) which may provide coping resources.
- Cosinor mesor/amplitude broadly typical, suggesting preserved overall rhythm.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) with a very large correlation to PSS in this sample (r = 0.77) — a strong predictor of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13.5) with substantial correlation to PSS (r = 0.49).
- High pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86), correlated moderately-to-strongly with PSS (~0.45–0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9) with a strong correlation with PSS (r = 0.66).
- Objective wearable markers indicating serious sleep/circadian disruption: very short median sleep (~3h55m), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.51), and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.75) — all of which modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Hourly HR patterns consistent with compressed/shifted rest-activity and flattened diurnal range.

Counterpoints for Participant 2 (potential buffers)
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.41) with a strong negative correlation to PSS in this cohort (r = -0.68), which is a substantial protective factor.
- Low interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = -1.27) and low resting HR/mesor (Z ≈ -0.9 to -1.4), suggesting lower tonic physiological arousal or better fitness.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s elevated measures (GAD-7, emotional lability, PSQI, pain) are associated with PSS much more strongly in their cohort (r’s up to ~0.77, 0.66, ~0.49, ~0.45) than Participant 1’s primary risk measures are in their cohort (CES-D and STAI with r ≈ 0.27–0.31, and physiological correlations mostly small ~0.13–0.15). Thus, elevations in Participant 2 map onto stronger, higher-weighted predictors of PSS.
- Severity and objective corroboration: Participant 2 has extremely short objective sleep (~4 hours) and pronounced blunted circadian amplitude, which are objective signs likely to exacerbate perceived stress and are present alongside multiple strong self-report risk factors. Participant 1’s worst single objective/self-report signal is very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 3.83) and high depressive symptoms, but many of Participant 1’s biological and behavioral indicators are either only modestly associated with PSS or point to resilience (long, stable objective sleep; exercise; social time).
- Protective factors: Both participants have protective signals. Participant 1’s protections (long objective sleep, exercise, social time, low substance use) likely temper risk but are weaker predictors of lower PSS in that sample. Participant 2’s strongest protective factor (high NGSE) has a large negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.68), which is meaningful, but it must be weighed against multiple very strong positive predictors (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66) and severe sleep/circadian disruption.
- Net balance: Considering magnitude of correlations and severity of risk indicators, Participant 2’s profile contains several high-weight, high-severity predictors of elevated PSS (especially anxiety, emotional lability, pain, and objective sleep restriction), whereas Participant 1’s elevated signals are more moderate in predictive weight (despite notable depression and PSQI).

Conclusion
Weighing the relative strengths, correlations, and objective corroboration across the two within-sample frames, Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

14,79341,24,15,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD-7 = 10.5 (meets screening threshold); GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77).  
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8.5 (well above clinical cutoff) and PSQI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- High pain/interference: PEG-3 mean 8.33 and PAPAS Z = 1.21; pain measures correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large overnight HR deviations (+13–14 bpm around midnight–2am; Z ≈ 1.25–1.36) that have meaningful positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Sleep timing variability/fragmentation: Large night-to-night sleep SD (199 min, Z = 0.65) known to exacerbate subjective stress.
- Integrated summary in description explicitly concludes perceived stress above the population mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Modest trait anxiety: STAI = 41 (correlates with PSS, r ≈ 0.31), which raises the possibility of elevated stress.  
- Low momentary positive affect: Very low self-rated “Happy” (Z ≈ -1.61), and low positive affect correlates with higher PSS.  
- Shorter/late sleep timing: Median sleep <7 h (Z ≈ -0.51) and late typical sleep onset (~01:50), which can impair coping and associate with higher stress.  
- Slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.32), which correlates weakly with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.16).  
- Some time-use (high video-game time) could reflect coping patterns associated with distress in some contexts.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Strength and direction of key predictors: Participant 1 shows several strong, PSS-linked indicators (clinically significant anxiety, markedly disturbed PSQI, high pain interference, and pronounced nocturnal HR elevations) that the description explicitly ties to higher PSS in that sample. These indicators are both subjectively and physiologically salient and have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in Participant 1’s study.  
- Participant 2’s self-report signals that could raise PSS are weaker or more mixed: STAI is near the study mean (Z ≈ -0.03) and CES-D is low-to-mild; the strongest negative signals for PSS in Participant 2 are objective/protective (very strong interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.9, 24-h autocorr Z ≈ 0.98, low RHR Z ≈ -1.18, PSQI ≈ 5). The study summary explicitly interprets Participant 2 as near-to-slightly-below their population mean.  
- Relative severity: Participant 1’s indicators include clinically meaningful cutoffs (GAD-7 ≥10; PSQI well >5; high pain) and physiological nocturnal HR elevations with moderate correlations to PSS — these are more directly indicative of elevated perceived stress within that study. Participant 2’s strongest signals are protective physiological/circadian markers that argue against high PSS despite some low positive affect and late sleep timing.
- Measurement context: Both participants have mixed signals, but the most directly PSS-linked and clinically notable measures (anxiety, poor sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) are concentrated and stronger for Participant 1. Participant 2’s countervailing, strongly protective measures (circadian regularity, low RHR) reduce the likelihood that their PSS is higher than Participant 1’s.

Conclusion
Based on the balance of within-sample evidence and the described correlations to PSS, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 12 (“disturbed sleep”), PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.50). Even though PSQI z vs this sample is modestly negative, the raw PSQI is high and commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Emotional lability: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z ≈ +0.53 and this scale has a strong correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.65), so mood instability is a meaningful risk signal for elevated perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated hourly heart rate overnight (1–4 AM) with correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41), plus elevated resting HR and mesor (RHR z ≈ +1.37, mesor z ≈ +1.18). These indicate physiological activation/poor overnight recovery that often accompanies higher stress.
- Dysregulated sleep timing/variability: extremely long median sleep and very large night-to-night variability (z’s > +2) indicate unstable sleep patterns that can co-occur with stress-related dysregulation.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower (or not elevated) PSS
- Several fairly strong protective signals: low pain burden (PEG-3 z ≈ -1.39; PAPAS z ≈ -1.24), relatively preserved interpersonal functioning (BASIS-24 interpersonal z ≈ -1.77), minimal substance problems, and only mild anxiety (GAD-7 z ≈ -0.59). Many of these measures correlate with PSS, so they reduce likelihood of a large PSS elevation.
- Several wearable/circadian metrics have only weak correlations with PSS in this sample, so although physiology looks dysregulated, the direct predictive value for PSS is limited here.
- Net description explicitly characterizes this participant as near the population mean PSS (20.96), with domain-specific modest elevations rather than a clear high PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Multiple elevated self-report measures that correlate with PSS: CES-D = 24 (z ≈ +1.11), STAI trait z ≈ +0.76; these are directly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (z ≈ +1.52, “Disturbed Sleep”), plus objectively short median sleep (6 h 1 min, z ≈ -1.45), very late median sleep start (~03:56 AM), and ~74 min night-to-night start-time variability. Late, short, and subjectively poor sleep is strongly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Objective circadian/physiological markers consistent with stress: reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -0.63), some intradaily fragmentation, and elevated late-night heart rate (12–2 AM) plus modestly above-average mesor/RHR — these align with blunted day–night differentiation and nocturnal arousal linked to higher PSS.
- Behavioral inactivity: reports no regular exercise (large negative z), which is a behavioral risk factor for higher stress.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant’s PSS is above their population mean (21.63).

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower (or not extremely high) PSS
- Several protective/neutral features: no substance use, strong academic performance (GPA 3.76), some social/leisure engagement, above-average interdaily stability and 24-hr autocorrelation — all mitigate but do not outweigh the multiple risk indicators.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Participant 1 is described as roughly at their sample mean (20.96) with a mix of domain-specific stress signals (sleep, emotional lability, nocturnal HR) and multiple protective factors (low pain, good interpersonal function, low anxiety relative to peers). Of the high-stress signals, emotional lability is particularly relevant because it has a strong correlation with PSS in this sample, but several other strong correlates of PSS (e.g., anxiety, pain) are actually lower-than-average for this person.
- Participant 2 is described as above their sample mean (21.63) with convergent elevations across several self-report domains (depression, trait anxiety, PSQI) that each have non-trivial correlations with PSS, plus objective circadian and sleep features (short, very late sleep; reduced amplitude; nocturnal HR elevation) that align in the same direction. Multiple z-scores for risk domains are moderate-to-large (e.g., PSQI z ≈ +1.52; CES-D z ≈ +1.11; STAI z ≈ +0.76), indicating a broader and more consistent tilt toward higher perceived stress compared with peers in that study.
- In short: Participant 1 shows some important stress-related signals but also several protective/offsetting factors and is explicitly rated near their mean. Participant 2 shows a broader, multi-domain pattern of elevations on measures that are known correlates of PSS and is explicitly rated above their mean.

Conclusion (balance of evidence)
- Participant 2 most likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS) relative to their respective study population and in cross-participant comparison.

25,22455,21,30,"Summary judgment: Participant 2 likely has the higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Wearable-derived circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.32) — these are associated with higher PSS in the sample (though correlations are modest, r ≈ 0.16 or smaller).
- Shorter and more variable sleep: median sleep ~6 h 7 min (z ≈ -1.33) and elevated night-to-night sleep variability (z ≈ +0.94), both weakly positively correlated with PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV/internet/music use, TV z ≈ +2.54) which is weakly associated with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate elevations (large positive hourly HR deviations at 5–7 AM) — atypical physiology that could reflect early awakenings or stress-related arousal, though interpretation is uncertain and could be behavioral/artifactual.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated anxiety: GAD‑7 = 6 (mild) and GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.78) — a major contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep), with PSQI moderately correlated with PSS (r = 0.49).
- Pain and functional interference: PEG‑3 ≈ 6.78 and PAPAS (z ≈ 0.24); pain metrics correlate moderately with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (value 0.19, z = -0.68) and very high sleep duration variability (SD z ≈ +1.7) — patterns commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale above mean (z ≈ 0.54), which can increase perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.59); Participant 2 is inferred to be at or modestly above their population mean PSS (mean = 21.04).
- Strength of signals: Participant 1’s strongest predictors are protective self-report measures (very low trait anxiety STAI z = -1.31, elevated happiness and self-esteem, low depressive symptoms) that are directly and moderately associated with lower PSS (STAI and CES‑D r ≈ 0.3). The objective markers that point toward higher stress in P1 have relatively small correlations with PSS in this sample.
- By contrast, Participant 2 shows multiple indicators that are both elevated and have relatively strong sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.78 and PSQI r = 0.49), plus pain and objective sleep/circadian irregularity with moderate correlations. While P2 also has protective factors (self‑efficacy, no substance problems), the most predictive signals favor slightly higher perceived stress.
- The small difference in population means (21.59 vs 21.04) does not change the within-sample inference: P1 is likely below their sample mean; P2 is likely at/above their sample mean.

Conclusion
- Overall balance of evidence supports that Participant 2 exhibits higher perceived stress than Participant 1.

11,14571,24,12,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Strong self-report predictors of PSS are elevated: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16, z = 1.16), high pain interference (PEG-3 z = 1.18), elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 1.23), and poor sleep quality (PSQI = 15, z = 0.5). These measures have substantial positive correlations with PSS in this sample.  
- Low perceived coping resources: low general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55), which is strongly negatively correlated with PSS, supporting higher perceived stress.  
- Convergent wearable physiology indicating sleep/circadian disruption: extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m, z = -0.82), very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low interdaily stability and reduced 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.4). These patterns are commonly linked to elevated stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal that correlates with PSS: marked night-time heart-rate elevations during typical sleep hours (e.g., 1–2am z = 1.18) and positive correlations between nocturnal HR deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40), supporting concurrent physiological stress.  
- Holistic convergence: multiple independent domains (self-report anxiety/sleep/pain + wearable sleep fragmentation + nocturnal autonomic arousal) point consistently above this study’s mean PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Behavioral risk factors that could raise perceived stress: very high sedentary/screen time (video games Z = 4.74, TV Z = 3.17, internet Z = 2.19) and very low exercise frequency—these remove behavioral stress buffers and can contribute to stress over time.  
- Low social trust (Z = -2.39), which could reflect poorer interpersonal support and increase vulnerability to stress.  
- Later sleep timing (median start ~01:04 AM) and modestly elevated cardiovascular tonic activation (mesor and amplitude z ≈ 1.35–1.72, resting HR z ≈ 0.51) — small signals that could be associated with higher perceived stress in this sample.  
- These are, however, described as smaller/more modest signals and correlations with PSS are generally weak in the sample.

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Each description is given relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as having indicators that align with PSS above their sample mean (population mean = 20.92), with multiple moderately large z-scores on measures that are strongly correlated with PSS. Participant 1’s physiological and self-report signals converge (severity of anxiety, almost negligible sleep duration, nocturnal HR elevations), producing a robust case for higher perceived stress within their cohort.  
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as below their study mean (population mean = 21.64). Their strongest signals are strongly protective (near-zero depressive symptoms CES-D z = -1.38, very low trait anxiety STAI z = -2.11, high circadian stability z = 2.4 and low fragmentation z = -2.29). The risk factors for Participant 2 (high sedentary time, low trust, late sleep, modestly higher HR measures) are present but described as smaller in magnitude and with weaker links to PSS in this sample.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple high-impact indicators (strongly correlated self-reports and corroborating wearable markers, including extreme sleep restriction and nocturnal autonomic arousal) point clearly toward elevated perceived stress relative to their cohort.  
- Participant 2: the dominant evidence points toward low perceived stress relative to their cohort; the countervailing risk factors are weaker and less directly tied to PSS in the sample.  
- Therefore, despite some risk signals in Participant 2, Participant 1 shows a substantially stronger and more convergent profile indicative of higher perceived stress.

18,21793,18,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean = 21.6)
- Marked sleep/circadian dysregulation: elevated PSQI (9, Z = +1.05), short median sleep (6 h 9 min, Z = -1.29), very late median sleep start (~03:36 AM) and elevated sleep-start variability (start-time SD Z ≈ +1.04). These sleep features are modestly correlated with PSS in this sample and tend to support higher perceived stress.
- High nap frequency: mean daily naps 0.33, Z = +3.05 — a very large deviation that co-occurs with disturbed nocturnal sleep and weakly correlates with higher PSS.
- Circadian fragmentation: very low interdaily stability (Z = -1.98) and elevated intradaily variability (Z = +0.95) indicate an unstable, fragmented 24-h pattern that correlates modestly with PSS.
- Elevated trait anxiety and mood signals: STAI = 43 (Z ≈ +0.17) and slightly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ +0.18); trait anxiety correlates with PSS (r ≈ +0.31), so these contribute to higher perceived stress.
- Recent functional/academic stressor: drop in GPA in most recent term may be an external stressor.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 21.17)
- High anxiety symptoms with strong sample-level linkage to PSS: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = +0.9) and GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.80). This is a powerful predictor that points to higher perceived stress.
- Severe sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep) and objectively very short median nightly sleep (2 h 19 min, Z = -1.04), very late sleep onset (~02:49 AM) and high start-time variability (start-time SD Z ≈ +1.16). Sleep metrics here are strongly aligned with higher PSS.
- Nighttime physiological arousal: elevated resting heart rate (81.23 bpm, Z = +1.67) and marked nocturnal HR elevations (+8–+9 bpm around midnight–2 AM) that have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42), indicating physiological hyperarousal at night.
- Circadian disruption: low amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), and elevated intradaily variability (Z = +1.23) — all consistent with higher stress.
- Emotional lability and pain-related interference: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +0.33 (r ≈ 0.66 with PSS) and PEG-3/PAPAS signals that correlate with PSS, adding to the stress burden.
- (Smaller protective factor) Slightly elevated self-efficacy (Z ≈ +0.12) which could buffer stress but is modest.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective study means. The question is which is more likely to have the higher PSS relative to their peer group.
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 2 has very strong predictors tied to PSS in that study: GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.80 and emotional-lability/pain metrics with moderately high correlations. Those associations are much larger than the primary PSS-linked associations noted for Participant 1 (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31, PSQI r ≈ 0.49 but PSQI Z and objective sleep disruption were less extreme than P2’s physiological/arousal signals in aggregate).
- Physiological arousal: Participant 2 shows clear physiological signs of arousal (high resting HR Z = +1.67, nocturnal HR elevations with moderate correlations to PSS) that align with higher perceived stress. Participant 1’s physiology points the opposite way (low resting HR and low MESOR), which plausibly attenuates perceived stress despite sleep/circadian irregularity.
- Magnitude and coherence of signals: Participant 1’s strongest deviations are circadian instability (interdaily stability Z = -1.98) and very high napping (Z = +3.05), but those features have relatively modest correlations with PSS in that sample. Participant 2 shows multiple moderately-to-strongly correlated signals (anxiety, emotional lability, nocturnal HR elevations, pain interference, severe sleep loss) that coherently point toward elevated perceived stress.
- Protective factors: Both have some protective factors (P1: low substance use, low resting HR, modest social/exercise; P2: modestly higher self-efficacy), but P2’s protections appear weaker relative to the strength of her risk signals.

Overall balance of evidence
- Although Participant 1 has substantial sleep/circadian disruption and a very large nap deviation, many of the physiologic and dispositional correlates of PSS are stronger and more numerous for Participant 2 (notably GAD-7 with very strong sample-level association, objective extreme short sleep and night-time HR arousal, emotional lability, pain interference). Participant 1’s low resting HR and other protective signs lessen the inferred PSS elevation.
- Therefore Participant 2’s profile is more strongly and coherently predictive of higher perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Subjective poor sleep quality: PSQI = 8 (above common clinical threshold; z ≈ 0.59) — subjective sleep complaints are associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Episodic physiological arousal: elevated intradaily variability (0.68, z = 0.95) suggests within-day fragmentation linked modestly to PSS.  
- Distinct hourly HR peaks: pronounced daytime and late-evening HR deviations (notably 12–1 pm, 1–2 pm, and 10–11 pm; z up to ≈3.14) that correlate weakly/ modestly with PSS and could reflect episodic stressors.  
- Lower momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which in the dataset is associated with higher PSS.

- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 16 (z = 1.16) with a very strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.78).  
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep: PSQI = 15 (z ≈ 0.5) and extremely short median sleep (~2 h 58 m; z ≈ -0.82) with very late sleep onset (~02:23).  
- Elevated pain/interference and emotional lability: PEG-3 z = 1.18; BASIS-24 emotional lability z = 1.23 — both associated with higher PSS.  
- Low perceived coping resources: NGSE = 22 (z = -1.55), a strong negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.66).  
- Robust wearable corroboration of nocturnal arousal and rhythm disruption: high intradaily variability (z = 1.3), low interdaily stability, low amplitude (z = -1.4), and nocturnal HR elevations that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.40).  
- Convergent pattern across self-report and physiology pointing to chronic/ongoing dysregulation rather than isolated episodes.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each summary is explicitly written relative to its own study mean PSS. Participant 1’s summary concludes the balance of evidence favors PSS below that study’s mean (21.64): multiple protective, low-z trait measures (CES‑D, STAI‑T), high self‑esteem (z = 1.66), good objective sleep duration (z = 1.31) and circadian stability (z = 0.67) outweigh episodic signals. The signals suggesting higher stress for P1 are relatively limited in scope (subjective PSQI, localized HR peaks, modest intradaily variability) and/or have small correlations with PSS.  
- Participant 2’s summary concludes PSS above that study’s mean (20.92): several strong, convergent indicators (severe anxiety with very high correlation to PSS, extreme subjective sleep disturbance, very short/late sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, elevated emotional lability, low self‑efficacy) point consistently toward elevated perceived stress. Many of these measures have moderate-to-large correlations with PSS in the dataset (e.g., GAD-7, NGSE, emotional lability), and physiological markers show pervasive circadian disruption rather than isolated episodes.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: primarily protective profile with some episodic/subjective complaints; overall inference was PSS below that study mean.  
- Participant 2: multiple, strong, and convergent risk signals (both self-report and wearable) that coherently indicate elevated perceived stress relative to their sample mean. The magnitude and breadth of dysregulation for Participant 2 exceed the more limited and mixed signals for Participant 1.

Final determination
- Participant 2 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS).

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11.5; classified “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI correlates positively with PSS, r ≈ 0.48).
- Extremely short objective sleep (median ≈ 3 h 30 min) and very late sleep onset (median ≈ 03:37 AM) — large abnormalities that strongly predict higher perceived stress in the sample.
- Elevated pain and pain interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43), and pain measures correlate moderately with PSS (~0.5).
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (late-night/early-morning hourly Z up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian robustness (reduced amplitude Z ≈ −0.34, reduced 24-h autocorrelation) — physiological signatures that in this cohort associate with higher PSS.
- Integration: multiple converging, moderate-to-strong risk signals (sleep, pain, nocturnal arousal) outweigh protective signals, so the summary already concluded “above the population mean.”

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within their study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ +1.52), a robust correlate of higher perceived stress.
- Wearable indices of circadian irregularity and fragmentation (low 24-h autocorrelation Z ≈ −0.87, interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.41, slightly elevated intradaily variability), and some sleep timing variability — these features predict higher stress in the sample.
- Slightly elevated nap behavior (mean naps Z ≈ +0.82) and fragmented rhythms could reflect stress-related behavioral disruption.

Comparative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Participant 1’s risk signals are larger in magnitude and more numerous in domains that have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS: extremely short objective sleep, clinically disturbed subjective sleep, elevated pain, and nocturnal physiological arousal. Although P1 has strong protective self-report signals (low anxiety, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability), the severity and multiplicity of the sleep/pain/physiology abnormalities led the original synthesis to place them above their population mean (21.21).
- Participant 2 shows a prominent subjective sleep problem and measurable circadian irregularity, but these are counterbalanced by consistently favorable psychosocial and physiological indicators (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem/happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, adequate median sleep duration). The original synthesis judged P2 to be near or modestly below their population mean (21.6).
- The two population means are very similar (21.21 vs 21.6), so absolute mean differences do not materially affect the comparison. The deciding factor is the relative strength and breadth of PSS-linked risk signals within each participant’s profile.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Overall, Participant 1 exhibits stronger and more numerous indicators that, in their study sample, are associated with higher perceived stress (especially extreme objective sleep restriction, pain, and nocturnal arousal). Participant 2’s sleep/circadian risk signals are present but are substantially offset by robust protective psychosocial and physiological factors. Therefore Participant 1 is the more likely to have the higher PSS (worse perceived stress).

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17; Z = +0.38; classified “Depressed”), which correlate positively with PSS (r = 0.28).  
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05; disturbed sleep) and objectively short, very late sleep (median 5:58 h, Z = −1.52; median sleep start ~02:25), patterns that clinically align with higher stress.  
- Circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = +0.46; 24-hour autocorrelation Z = −0.19) and periods of elevated evening heart-rate deviation (peak 5–6 pm Z = +1.69), which in this sample are associated with higher PSS (though correlations are modest).  
- Elevated mesor and slightly higher resting HR (mesor Z ≈ +0.95; resting HR Z = +0.47) consistent with greater physiological activation.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might not have very high PSS (protective/mitigating)
- Frequent exercise (Z = +1.07), good self-rated physical health (Z = +1.30), higher interpersonal trust (Z = +1.79), low recreational drug use and moderate alcohol — factors that can buffer perceived stress.  
- Some wearable–PSS correlations in this dataset are small, limiting how strongly physiological markers alone predict higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Multiple self-report measures that are strong sample-level predictors of PSS: GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety) with very high correlation to PSS (r = 0.77), elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24; z = 0.93; r = 0.67), and lower self-efficacy (NGSE z = −0.62; r = −0.66). These associations are large and directly predictive of higher PSS in this dataset.  
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; disturbed sleep; r = 0.49), which is a meaningful correlate of elevated PSS here.  
- Some wearable/behavioral indices consistent with stress: high resting HR (77.6 bpm, Z = +1.31), elevated MESOR (Z = +1.19), and large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD Z = +1.12) — all compatible with greater arousal or disrupted recovery.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have very high PSS (protective/mitigating)
- Median nightly sleep ~7 hours (7:01, Z = +0.56) — not short and potentially restorative.  
- Low intradaily variability (Z = −1.20), positive 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = +0.25), modestly higher amplitude (Z = +0.43) — indicators of consolidated daily rhythm that can be protective.  
- Some wearable heart-rate features show weak/discordant correlations with PSS in this dataset, limiting their diagnostic weight.

Comparative reasoning (within each study’s frame)
- Both participants are described as having inferred PSS above their respective population means. Participant 1’s inference rests on several indicators (notably elevated trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed subjective sleep, marked short/late sleep, and circadian fragmentation), but many of these predictors have only modest correlations with PSS in that sample (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28; sleep-duration correlation minimal). Participant 1 also has several protective factors (regular exercise, good self-rated health, high interpersonal trust) that may moderate perceived stress.  
- Participant 2’s inference is driven strongly by self-report measures that, in that dataset, have large sample-level associations with PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.77; BASIS emotional lability r = 0.67; NGSE r = −0.66; PSQI r = 0.49). Even though some objective features are mixed, the self-report predictors for Participant 2 are both more numerous and more strongly correlated with PSS than the primary contributors described for Participant 1. Participant 2’s protective circadian consolidation and adequate median sleep mitigate but do not eliminate the weight of these strong self-report predictors.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Because Participant 2’s profile includes multiple self-report predictors that have large, direct sample-level correlations with PSS (particularly anxiety, emotional lability, and low self-efficacy), the evidence indicates a stronger likelihood that Participant 2’s perceived stress is higher relative to their cohort mean than Participant 1’s is relative to theirs. Participant 1 shows meaningful indicators of elevated stress, but these indicators generally have smaller sample-level associations with PSS and are counterbalanced by stronger resilience/protective behaviors.

24,14847,33,24,"Participant 1 — potential reasons for higher PSS:
- Very high generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = 1.51) and this measure has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74).  
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5; Z = 1.65), a measure that correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.43).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 1.03) with a strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.63).  
- Elevated pain and functional interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS composite) that are positively associated with PSS.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44) and other self-report indicators that converge on more perceived stress.  
- Note of moderation: several objective wearable markers (higher interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, low RHR/mesor, clear amplitude) are relatively protective and argue for physiological regularity, but the subjective measures that have large effect-size correlations with PSS dominate the inference.

Participant 2 — potential reasons for higher PSS:
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z = 0.86) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 24; Z = 1.11), both positively correlated with PSS (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28).  
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52).  
- Strong objective signs of circadian/behavioral instability: very high intradaily variability (Z = 2.01), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.49), late and highly variable sleep timing (median start ~02:24, SD ≈ 104 min), shorter nocturnal sleep (median 6 h 38 min, Z ≈ -0.69), and elevated nap frequency (Z ≈ 1.90). These objective disruptions align with higher perceived stress.  
- Note of moderation: protective lifestyle/self-report factors (frequent exercise Z ≈ 1.07, higher happiness and health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.55–0.97, substantial social/leisure engagement) and normal resting heart rate reduce the likelihood of extremely high PSS.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning:
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means (Participant 1 above 20.54; Participant 2 above 21.61). The key question is which profile implies a larger elevation in perceived stress given each description's local (within‑study) frame.
- Participant 1’s strongest indicators (GAD-7, PSQI, BASIS-24 Emotional Lability) are not only high in absolute/relative terms (Zs ~1.0–1.7) but are also measures that show large correlations with PSS in that sample (especially GAD-7 r = 0.74 and emotional lability r = 0.63). That gives these elevated scores high predictive weight for higher PSS.
- Participant 2 has several elevated features (CES-D, STAI, PSQI and especially intradaily variability Z = 2.01), but the self-report predictors in Participant 2 have more modest correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31 for CES‑D/STAI), and the objectively large circadian disruption (IV Z = 2.01) has only a small correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16). In addition, Participant 2 shows several buffering factors (exercise, social/leisure engagement, normal RHR).
- In short: Participant 1’s profile contains very high scores on measures that are both strongly elevated and strongly associated with PSS in that cohort, whereas Participant 2’s largest objective deviation (IV) and affective elevations are either less strongly linked to PSS or partly offset by resilience indicators.

Weighing the balance of evidence, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

17,45076,19,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean of 21.6)
- Modest elevations in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI Z = +0.27; CES‑D Z = +0.18), both of which correlate positively with PSS in that sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28).
- Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 6, clinically meaningful) and late/variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~00:57; night-to-night SD ≈ 63 min) that commonly track with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity signals (interdaily stability Z = -0.74; some intradaily fragmentation Z = +0.32) and small early‑morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).
- Lower recent happiness and health‑satisfaction (small negative Zs) that tend to co-occur with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean of 21.12)
- Severe self‑reported anxiety (GAD‑7 Z = +1.25) and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +0.83); both measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in that dataset (GAD‑7 r = 0.81; PSQI r = 0.51), making them high-weight indicators of elevated PSS.
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62; NGSE r ≈ -0.66 with PSS) and moderate pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS; r ≈ 0.44–0.48), both of which strongly favor higher perceived stress.
- Elevated physiological arousal: resting HR Z ≈ +1.53 and mesor Z ≈ +1.49, consistent with sustained autonomic arousal associated with stress.
- Wearable sleep showing extremely short median sleep (2 h 31 min, Z ≈ -0.97), very late and highly variable sleep onset (SD 254 min, Z ≈ +0.98); subjective PSQI corroborates pronounced sleep disturbance (reducing chance this is purely a wearable artifact).

Comparative weighting within each study frame
- Both participants are assessed relative to similar population means (P1 mean 21.6; P2 mean 21.12), so comparisons should focus on strength and consistency of risk vs protective signals rather than absolute mean differences.
- Participant 1: risk signals are generally small-to-moderate (small positive Zs on anxiety/depression, PSQI just above clinical cutpoint, circadian irregularity modest), and several relatively strong protective factors (self‑esteem Z = +1.38, frequent exercise, low substance use, adequate sleep duration Z = +0.56, healthy resting HR) substantially counterbalance the risks. The published interpretation concludes “near the mean, possibly slightly above.”
- Participant 2: multiple, large, and convergent high‑weight indicators point to elevated perceived stress—severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, low self‑efficacy, pain interference, and elevated resting HR/mesor. Several of these measures have very strong correlations with PSS in that study (especially GAD‑7 and NGSE), and subjective and objective sleep measures point in the same direction. The published interpretation concludes “above the mean.”

Final judgement
- The balance of evidence strongly favors Participant 2 as having the higher PSS (more perceived stress). Participant 2 shows multiple large, convergent risk indicators with strong sample-level correlations to PSS, whereas Participant 1 shows only modest risk signals that are substantially offset by robust protective factors.

- Evening physiological arousal: a pronounced hourly heart‑rate deviation at 6–7 pm (z ≈ +2.22) that could reflect consistent stress‑related activation.  
- Modest intradaily variability and sleep timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 68 min), plus modest nap frequency (z ≈ +0.7), which correlate positively (albeit weakly) with PSS in this sample.  
- Slightly reduced self‑reported happiness and health satisfaction (small negative z‑scores) that are associated with higher PSS.  
Overall: these signals are secondary and small in magnitude relative to the strong indicators pointing toward lower stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12) — noted as the single strongest predictor here given a high correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77).  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5, z = +1.32), which correlates moderately with PSS.  
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (several hourly deviations with z ≈ 0.7–1.0) that are positively correlated with PSS, suggesting impaired nighttime recovery.  
- Low self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.25) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24), both tied to higher PSS in this dataset.  
- Elevated substance‑use score (BASIS‑24 substance z ≈ +1.5) adds risk contextually.  
Overall: multiple high‑impact, convergent signals point toward above‑mean perceived stress.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each summary is explicitly relative to its own study population mean: Participant 1 is characterized as most consistent with a PSS below their population mean (mean = 21.62); Participant 2 is characterized as most consistent with a PSS above their population mean (mean = 20.67).  
- The magnitudes and predictive strength differ: Participant 1’s strongest indicators (low CES‑D and STAI, good PSQI and sleep duration, robust circadian metrics, low substance use, high GPA) are substantial and point away from high perceived stress. The countervailing signals for P1 are smaller in magnitude and weaker predictors of PSS.  
- Participant 2’s profile contains several high‑impact predictors with strong correlations to PSS (notably GAD‑7 with r ≈ 0.77 and very elevated PSQI), plus physiological nocturnal arousal that aligns with those self‑report elevations. While P2 also has some protective physiological signs (adequate objective sleep duration, lower resting HR), the most salient and strongly correlated indicators favor higher perceived stress.  
- The two population means are similar (21.62 vs 20.67), so the within‑sample directional labels (below vs above mean) are meaningful for comparing likely relative stress; the stronger, high‑correlation signals in Participant 2 outweigh Participant 1’s smaller situational arousal signs.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: predominantly lower‑stress profile relative to their sample, with only modest situational signals.  
- Participant 2: multiple convergent, high‑impact signals (anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy) that strongly favor above‑mean perceived stress.  
Conclusion: Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher PSS.

4,44927,31,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their population frame)
- Description explicitly states perceived stress above the study mean (population mean PSS = 20.62).
- Strong, high-impact self-report risk signals: severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 18; Z = 1.51) and markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = 0.83). Anxiety in this sample is highly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.75), amplifying the likely PSS elevation.
- Substantial pain and activity interference (PEG-3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS and reduce coping capacity.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -1.73), a robust predictor of higher PSS in this cohort (r ≈ -0.61).
- Objective physiological support for hyperarousal: large nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83), late sleep onset (~01:42) and short median sleep (~4 h 55 m), consistent with mechanisms that increase perceived stress.
- Mitigating factors (circadian amplitude, interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, average resting HR, low substance use) are present but are described as partial buffers that do not outweigh the strong symptom-based signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their population frame)
- Description places perceived stress near-to-slightly-above the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.61).
- Some modest psychosocial risk indicators: trait anxiety (STAI = 40; STAI–PSS r ≈ 0.31), lower self-esteem (RSES Z = -0.87), and lower happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) — all modestly associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian and sleep vulnerabilities: reduced cosinor amplitude (Z = -0.39), slightly reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.16), late sleep timing (~00:59) and somewhat short sleep (6 h 34 m; Z ≈ -0.77) — these features are associated with higher PSS but effect sizes are small-to-moderate.
- Protective and stress-reducing features are numerous and nontrivial: low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = -0.76), favorable cardiovascular markers (low resting HR, pronounced nocturnal HR drop), relatively high 24-h autocorrelation (Z = 0.48), high sports participation (Z = 1.58), and minimal substance use. Many z-scores are near zero, indicating only modest deviation from the mean.

Comparative weighing of evidence
- Magnitude and coherence: Participant 1 shows multiple, large-magnitude and coherent indicators strongly linked to PSS (severe anxiety with very high correlation to PSS, high pain, very poor subjective sleep, low self-efficacy, nocturnal HR arousal). These signals are large (Z-scores >1 in several domains) and point consistently toward above-mean stress.
- Participant 2 shows a mixed profile with mostly small-to-moderate deviations; risk indicators exist but are weaker and partially offset by several protective physiological and behavioral markers. The summary explicitly places them near-to-slightly-above their population mean, indicating a relatively mild elevation if any.
- Both descriptions are relative to different population means, but the intensity, number, and effect-size relevance of stress-linked features are substantially greater for Participant 1 than for Participant 2.

9,49539,12,22,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very short objective sleep duration (median ~3h27m, Z = -0.66) and very high night-to-night variability (sleep SD Z = 0.62), both of which are associated with higher PSS in the sample (PSQI r = 0.46; IV r = 0.24 for circadian fragmentation).
- High intradaily variability (IV = 0.64, Z = 2.29), indicating fragmented rest‑activity patterns that trend with higher PSS.
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS‑24 interpersonal = Z = 0.94) that could act as an additional psychosocial stressor (even though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- High intradaily variability (IV Z = 2.01), indicating circadian/behavioral fragmentation linked to worse subjective stress.
- Very large evening physiological arousal (11pm–12am HR deviation Z = 4.79) and late sleep onset (~01:45), suggesting pre‑sleep activation that commonly undermines subjective rest and can raise perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed sleep), which in this sample tends to associate with higher PSS.
- Lower frequency of exercise/recreation (not quantified here) that may reduce behavioral buffering against stress.

Comparative framing (within each study population)
- Participant 1 is explicitly inferred in their report to be below the population mean PSS. The strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (low GAD‑7, high general self‑efficacy NGSE, and very low emotional lability) point powerfully toward lower perceived stress in this participant; those predictors have large correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.76, NGSE r ≈ -0.65). The main countervailing evidence for higher stress is severe sleep restriction and fragmentation, but these predictors have smaller/more moderate sample-level associations.
- Participant 2 is inferred to be near the population mean PSS (perhaps slightly below), but shows pronounced circadian fragmentation and an extreme evening HR spike—salient objective signals that are plausibly linked to elevated perceived stress episodes. Although Participant 2 also has strong protective markers (very low trait anxiety/depression, high self‑esteem, good median sleep duration), the presence of large physiological evening arousal and subjective sleep disturbance make their overall PSS profile higher (or at least closer to the mean) than Participant 1’s profile relative to their peers.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: mixed profile but overall leans below their study mean PSS because the strongest predictors in that sample (anxiety, self‑efficacy, emotional lability) indicate lower stress despite extreme sleep problems.
- Participant 2: mixed profile but overall closer to the study mean (and thus relatively higher than Participant 1), because objective circadian/physiological risk signals (high IV, extreme evening HR deviation, PSQI > 5) outweigh some protective factors enough to place them nearer the sample mean PSS.

6,67192,20,31,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- High internalizing symptom burden: CES‑D = 32 (Z ≈ 1.95) and STAI = 58 (Z ≈ 1.65). Both measures are positively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.27 and 0.31) and are among the strongest psychological signals pointing toward elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated tonic and evening autonomic arousal: MESOR Z ≈ 2.01 and resting HR Z ≈ 1.62, with pronounced evening HR deviations (e.g., +16.3 bpm around 10–11 pm). Physiological tone and evening activation support an inference of heightened stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and large sleep‑timing variability: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), late and variable sleep start (median ≈ 01:15, SD ≈ 110 min) and sleep‑duration variability (SD ≈ 108 min) — these factors correlate positively with PSS in the study.
- Low perceived health: very low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.03) and low BMI (17.8) add to a distress signal.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower PSS (mitigating evidence)
- Objective sleep duration is adequate (~7h16, Z ≈ 0.10).
- Strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation Zs ≈ 0.9–1.2) and high social engagement (Z ≈ 2.53) which are associated with lower PSS and may buffer stress.
- Low substance use.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Several self‑report predictors that correlate strongly with PSS in this dataset: GAD‑7 = 10 (moderate anxiety; in this sample GAD r ≈ 0.77 with PSS), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r ≈ 0.49), elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 z ≈ 0.93; r ≈ 0.67), and low general self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.62; r ≈ -0.66). Collectively these self‑report measures are highly predictive of above‑mean PSS in this study.
- Somatic burden: pain interference (PEG ≈ 5.0; r ≈ 0.44) and notable night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ 1.12) support greater perceived stress.
- Elevated baseline cardiac indices (resting HR z ≈ 1.31, MESOR z ≈ 1.19) consistent with higher autonomic activation.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (mitigating evidence)
- Median nightly sleep duration ~7:01 (Z ≈ 0.56) and low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -1.20) indicate consolidated daily rhythm and some physiological resilience.
- Circadian amplitude and autocorrelation are modestly positive, and naps are uncommon — these features blunt a complete high‑stress interpretation.
- Many wearable circadian/HR metrics have weak or inconsistent correlations with PSS in this sample, limiting how strongly physiology can be used to infer PSS here.

Comparative, within‑study framing and weighing the evidence
- Both summaries conclude each participant is likely above their study’s mean PSS (P1 mean = 21.59; P2 mean = 21.08). We must compare the strength and extremity of the predictors relative to their respective sample distributions and to the known PSS correlations.
- Participant 1 shows very large deviations on internalizing symptom measures (CES‑D Z ≈ 1.95 and STAI Z ≈ 1.65) and very large physiologic deviation on MESOR (Z ≈ 2.01) and evening HR, plus very low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.03). Those elevations are direct and comparatively large in magnitude and align with measures that, in this sample, predict higher PSS.
- Participant 2 has several predictors that, as types of measures, have stronger sample‑level correlations with PSS (notably GAD r ≈ 0.77, BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.67, NGSE r ≈ -0.66). However, the participant’s standardized scores on those measures are more moderate (e.g., GAD z ≈ 0.11, BASIS‑24 z ≈ 0.93, NGSE z ≈ -0.62). The most extreme single self‑report for P2 is PSQI (very high = 13.5), which strongly relates to PSS, but otherwise P2’s elevations are generally less extreme in z‑score magnitude than P1’s.
- Physiological evidence favors P1 for higher stress (larger HR/MESOR deviations and evening activation) while some circadian protections and social support mitigate P1’s inferred stress. Physiological evidence for P2 is mixed and generally weaker in its predictive value here because many wearable metrics correlate poorly with PSS in that sample.

Reasoned conclusion
- Considering the magnitude of psychological symptomatology and physiological arousal relative to each participant’s sample distribution, the balance of evidence indicates that Participant 1 is likely exhibiting the worse overall perceived stress.

- Sleep timing and quality: median sleep onset ≈ 2:10 AM and PSQI = 7 (“disturbed sleep”); PSQI correlates positively with PSS.
- Compensatory/fragmented sleep behavior: elevated nap frequency (z = 2.07) which correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.14).
- Behavioral risk/low activity: more frequent alcohol use (z = 1.72) and low structured exercise (1–2×/wk), which can accompany higher stress in some individuals.
- Net effect relative to P1’s population mean: the summary explicitly notes objective markers point toward greater disruption associated with higher PSS and concludes P1’s inferred PSS is approximately near the population mean (21.62) with a modest tendency toward elevation.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep complaints: PSQI = 7 (“disturbed sleep”); PSQI–PSS correlation is moderate (r ≈ 0.42), so this is the primary countervailing signal.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations (early-morning hours) that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31), which could modestly relate to higher perceived stress.
- Net effect relative to P2’s population mean: the overall summary states these are isolated signals and that the participant’s PSS is likely below the population mean (21.5).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own cohort mean. Participant 1 is characterized as near the mean (21.62) with mixed signals and a modest tilt toward elevated PSS driven by objective circadian/sleep disruption. Participant 2 is characterized as below the mean (21.5), with very strong, convergent indicators of low stress (very high self-efficacy, minimal anxiety, strong circadian stability, very low RHR) and only isolated sleep-related concerns.
- The strongest predictors of PSS in these descriptions are self-report anxiety/self-efficacy measures (larger correlations) and those strongly favor Participant 2 having low PSS (GAD–PSS r ≈ 0.75; NGSE–PSS r ≈ -0.60). Participant 1’s low CES‑D/STAI and higher self‑esteem argue against high PSS for P1, but those effects appear to leave P1 near the mean rather than clearly below it because objective circadian/sleep disruptions (albeit with smaller correlations) push toward higher PSS.
- Overall balance: Participant 2 shows multiple, large-magnitude signals pointing to below-mean PSS and only limited contrary evidence. Participant 1 shows a mixed profile with objective signals pulling toward higher PSS and subjective reports pulling toward lower PSS, and the summary places P1 near (with slight tendency above) the cohort mean.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (disturbed sleep) plus late and highly variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:19, sleep SD ≈ 113 min) and increased napping (z = +2.27), which often accompany higher perceived stress.
- Circadian/physiological rhythm dysregulation: reduced circadian amplitude (z = -1.48), low interdaily stability (z = -1.40), and pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (8–9pm mean deviation +20.14, z ≈ +1.85) consistent with elevated evening arousal.
- Behavioral signs consistent with stress: reduced restorative leisure activities and elevated internet use.
- Convergence of self-report and wearable signals (sleep/circadian disturbance + elevated mood symptoms) supports an above-mean PSS inference.

Reasons tempering that inference for Participant 1
- Relatively normal resting heart rate and fitness-like indicators, healthy BMI, good academic performance, modest substance use, and some socializing—these are protective/neutral signals.
- Key self-report–PSS correlations for the strongest self-report signals (CES-D, STAI) are modest in this sample, so predictive strength is limited.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.17)
- Strong anxiety signal with high predictive value: GAD-7 = 14.5 (z = 0.9) and this measure has a very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).
- Extremely short and irregular objective sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 19 m (z ≈ -1.04), very late median sleep onset (~02:49 AM) and very high start-time SD (z ≈ +1.16); PSQI = 13 (severe subjective disturbance). These sleep metrics are strongly stress-relevant and PSQI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).
- Physiological arousal and flattened rhythms: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm, z = +1.67), low circadian amplitude (z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (z = -1.34), elevated intradaily variability (z = +1.23). Nocturnal HR elevations (~+8–9 bpm at 12–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).
- Elevated emotional lability and pain-related interference (BASIS-24, PEG-3) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (e.g., BASIS r ≈ 0.66; pain-related burden r ≈ 0.47).

Reasons tempering that inference for Participant 2
- Modestly higher self-efficacy (z ≈ +0.12) which correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.65) and could buffer stress.
- Some wearable measures have small/near-zero correlations with PSS in this sample, but the participant’s strongest abnormalities are in metrics that do show meaningful associations with PSS (anxiety, sleep disruption, nocturnal arousal).

Comparative reasoning in the within-sample frame
- Both participants are described as having perceived stress above their respective sample means. The question is which profile reflects a higher level of perceived stress relative to their cohorts.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, disturbed sleep (subjective and timing variability), and evening HR spikes. However, the self-report measures that are most elevated have only modest sample-level correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Protective signals (normal resting HR, adequate average sleep duration, healthy functioning) are nontrivial.
- Participant 2 shows multiple convergent signals that are both severe and more tightly linked to PSS in their sample: moderate-to-high anxiety on GAD-7 with a very large correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.80), extremely short and very irregular objective sleep, elevated resting HR and flattened circadian amplitude, nocturnal HR arousal that correlates with PSS, and elevated emotional lability and pain burden. Several of these features have moderate-to-strong sample-level correlations with PSS, increasing confidence that they reflect higher perceived stress.
- Overall balance: Participant 2’s combination of (a) a highly predictive anxiety measure, (b) extreme objective sleep loss/irregularity, and (c) physiological arousal/flattened rhythms that are tied to PSS provides stronger and more severe evidence of elevated perceived stress than Participant 1’s profile, where key predictors have weaker sample-level associations and protective signs are more prominent.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (above common cutoff), which is commonly associated with higher perceived stress even when objective sleep duration is good.  
- Episodic physiological arousal: elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (z ≈ 0.95) indicating within-day fragmentation linked modestly to higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17).  
- Pronounced hourly HR peaks (midday and ~10–11pm) with high z-scores (up to ~3.14) that correlate weakly/ modestly with PSS, suggesting intermittent arousal episodes that could elevate perceived stress at particular times.  
- Lower momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), and lower positive affect correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ -0.20).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (within Participant 2’s own study frame)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety: GAD-7 = 10.5 (at screening threshold), strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77) — a very strong predictor of higher PSS.  
- Emotional lability: elevated BASIS-24 Emotional Lability (z ≈ 0.53) with a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8.5 (disturbed sleep), moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Pain and interference elevated (PEG-3 mean 8.33, PAPAS z ≈ 1.21) with moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Nocturnal/evening physiological arousal: notable HR elevations around midnight–2am (+13–14 bpm; z ≈ 1.25–1.36) and evening elevations that have moderate correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ 0.65) which can exacerbate subjective stress.

Comparative weighting within each participant’s population frame
- Strength and number of risk indicators: Participant 2 has multiple, relatively strong self-report risk signals that are highly correlated with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77 and emotional lability r ≈ 0.65), plus corroborating nocturnal HR elevations and pain interference. Those are direct, high-correlation predictors of higher PSS in Participant 2’s study.  
- Protective signals and ambiguity for Participant 1: Participant 1 shows strong protective signals (very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem, long consistent objective sleep, low resting HR, above-average circadian stability). The elevated signals for Participant 1 (PSQI, intradaily HR variability, hourly HR peaks) are weaker predictors of PSS in that sample (smaller correlations) and appear episodic rather than pervasive.  
- Magnitude of physiological–PSS associations: The physiological and self-report measures that point to higher stress in Participant 2 generally have larger correlations with PSS (r’s up to ~0.77 and ~0.65 for key measures) than the analogous risk signals in Participant 1 (r’s mostly small, ~0.17–0.20).

Overall determination
- On balance, the evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely to have the higher perceived stress (i.e., a PSS above their study mean), whereas Participant 1 is more likely below their study mean given the stronger protective and lower-symptom profile.

These measures are noted to have meaningful sample correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.31; PSQI and happiness also correlated).
- Objective sleep disturbance consistent with higher stress: very large night-to-night sleep duration variability (sleep duration SD z = +2.68) and highly variable/late sleep onset (median start ≈ 03:11 AM; start-time SD z = +1.43). Sleep timing/variability measures have modest positive correlations with PSS in that cohort.
- Physiological patterning that could amplify stress: pronounced evening/late-night heart-rate elevations and a delayed heart-rate acrophase (~7:41 PM) aligned with late sleep timing, plausibly creating internal misalignment and daytime conflict.
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant’s overall perceived stress is above the study mean (population mean 21.62), based on convergent affective and sleep signals.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Marked subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 16 (z = +0.83) and wearable-derived very short median sleep duration (1 h 44 min; z = −1.24) plus variable sleep start times—PSQI has a strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive risk factor.
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG-3 z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS z ≈ +0.8) that correlate moderately-to-strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), and some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal.
- The study summary states the participant’s inferred stress is near the sample mean (population mean 21.5) with a modest upward contribution from sleep disturbance and pain.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Participant 1’s profile contains several moderately-to-strongly elevated self-report affective measures (notably CES-D z +1.53) and very large objective sleep variability (z +2.68). Those signals are explicitly tied to higher PSS in their cohort and the summary interprets the pattern as above-mean stress.
- Participant 2 does have significant risk factors (PSQI, pain) that push toward higher PSS, but those are offset by multiple robust protective indicators in their cohort: very low GAD-7 (z = −1.2) with a strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.75), higher circadian amplitude (z = +1.38), low intradaily variability (z = −1.35), and lower resting HR (z = −1.02). The study summary rates this participant as near the mean (only modestly elevated, if at all).
- Strength and convergence of signals matter: Participant 1 shows multiple convergent internalizing symptoms and objectively large sleep irregularity that were interpreted as above-mean in their sample. Participant 2’s elevated sleep/pain risks are partly counterbalanced by especially strong protective indicators (notably the very low GAD-7), and the investigators judged their stress closer to the cohort mean.

Weighted conclusion
- Taking the balance of evidence within each participant’s cohort, Participant 1 more clearly shows a pattern interpreted as above-mean perceived stress, with multiple convergent affective and objective sleep markers supporting that inference. Participant 2 is characterized as near the mean with mixed signals and several strong protections that likely limit overall perceived stress.

7,34062,15,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe objective sleep loss: median nightly sleep ≈ 4 h 22 min (far below sample mean) — a strong, direct correlate of elevated perceived stress in the dataset.
- Large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z ≈ +0.89) and very irregular sleep onset (SD = 204 min; z ≈ +0.34) — high variability and irregular timing are associated with higher PSS.
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; classified “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample).
- Markedly elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal subscale z = +2.34), a salient contextual stressor likely to raise perceived stress.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (z ≈ −1.05), indicating weakened circadian organization and behavioral irregularity that commonly co-occur with higher stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or not elevated) PSS score
- Minimal current anxiety (GAD‑7 z ≈ −1.38) and low depressive/emotional-lability signals (BASIS‑24 emotional lability z ≈ −1.27).
- Low pain and low pain interference (PAPAS/PEG z ≈ −1.29).
- Near-average self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ −0.07) and below-average resting HR / MESOR — physiological signs that often co-occur with lower perceived stress.
- Holistic summary provided by the description: overall “near the mean” with a modest tilt above it (population mean PSS = 21.29).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; classified “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI z ≈ +1.52), which in this dataset predicts higher PSS.
- Wearable-derived circadian irregularity: reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.41), low 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ −0.87), slightly reduced amplitude (z ≈ −0.40), modestly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ +0.17).
- Some sleep-timing variability (SD ≈ 95 min) and slightly increased napping (z ≈ +0.82) — patterns that in the sample correlate positively with PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower (or not elevated) PSS score
- Low depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ −0.66) and low trait anxiety (STAI Trait z ≈ −0.52).
- Strong psychosocial resources and positive affect: high self‑esteem (z ≈ +1.38), high happiness (z ≈ +1.64), high health satisfaction (z ≈ +1.80).
- Healthy behaviors and functioning: regular exercise, low substance use, adequate median sleep duration (~7 h 6 min, near sample mean), good academic functioning.
- Low resting heart rate and low MESOR (z ≈ −1.48 and −2.08), consistent with good fitness/low tonic arousal that typically relate to lower perceived stress.
- Holistic summary provided: overall interpreted as near or slightly below the study mean PSS (population mean = 21.6).

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Participant 1’s strongest stress-related signals are more severe and specific: extreme objective sleep restriction (≈4.4 h/night), high night-to-night variability, and very high interpersonal-strain (z = +2.34). These are powerful, direct risk factors for elevated perceived stress in the study context.
- Participant 2 also shows sleep/circadian signals that point toward higher stress, but these are milder (PSQI elevated but median sleep duration is adequate, circadian z-scores modest). Crucially, Participant 2 has multiple, relatively strong protective psychosocial and behavioral indicators (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem/happiness, regular exercise, very low resting HR) that the description explicitly weighs as stronger than the sleep signals, leading to an inference of PSS near or slightly below that study mean.
- The provided holistic assessments: Participant 1 = “near the mean, modest tilt above the mean”; Participant 2 = “near the mean, leaning modestly below the mean.” Interpreting both within their own population frames, Participant 1 appears at higher perceived stress relative to peers than Participant 2 does relative to theirs.

16,21932,23,13,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their report)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 12 (clinically disturbed sleep), which correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.50).
- Emotional dysregulation: BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53 and that measure correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Elevated baseline and nocturnal cardiovascular arousal: resting HR z = 1.37, mesor z = 1.18, plus marked nocturnal HR elevations (night-hour deviations +10.24 to +4.18 bpm) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Marked sleep timing/variability abnormalities (median sleep 12 h, z = 2.26; sleep SD z = 2.38) consistent with disrupted sleep-regulation that can accompany stress.
- Several of these signals (sleep problems, emotional lability, nocturnal arousal) are directly and moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS in the study sample.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their report)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (meets threshold for disturbed sleep), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated intradaily variability (HR-based) z ≈ 0.95 and pronounced hourly HR peaks (midday and 10–11 pm; z ≈ 2.1–3.1) that suggest episodic physiological arousal; these features have modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Slightly reduced momentary positive affect (Happy z ≈ -0.53), which modestly relates to higher PSS.
- These signals point to intermittent/arousal-related contributors to perceived stress, but they are fewer and weaker than the protective signals listed below.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean; the two population means are similar (20.96 vs 21.64), so relative positions are reasonably comparable.
- Participant 1 is characterized as near the study mean (with some domain-specific elevations), whereas Participant 2 is characterized as below their study mean.
- The strength and number of stress-linked signals are greater for Participant 1: clinically notable PSQI (12), strong emotional-lability → PSS relationship, and clear nocturnal HR elevation and high resting HR (all of which have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS). These are domain-convergent indicators of higher perceived stress.
- Participant 2 shows several robust protective indicators (low CES-D and STAI-Trait, high self-esteem, long and regular objective sleep, low resting HR and decent circadian stability). The stress-linked signals for Participant 2 are primarily episodic (hourly HR peaks, subjective PSQI = 8) and generally weaker in their associations with PSS than Participant 1’s strongest indicators.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Overall evidence points to Participant 1 having a higher perceived-stress burden relative to Participant 2 when evaluated in their respective population frames: Participant 1 shows multiple, moderately/strongly PSS-associated signals (sleep disturbance, emotional lability, nocturnal and baseline cardiovascular arousal), while Participant 2’s profile is dominated by protective trait and objective physiological markers with only modest, intermittent stress signals.

15,31175,15,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; Z ≈ 0.59). PSQI in this sample correlates positively with PSS.
- Very large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD Z = 3.37), a strong deviation from the sample that is often linked to stress and dysregulated routines.
- Blunted heart-rate circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.81) and lowered MESOR (Z = -1.28); reduced amplitude is modestly associated with higher PSS in this dataset (amplitude r ≈ -0.16).
- Some trait anxiety (STAI = 40), and lower current happiness (Z = -0.53); STAI has a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- The summary explicitly concludes the participant is “somewhat above the population mean” for perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population):
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 15.5; Z ≈ 0.67) and PSQI has a strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- High pain/functional impairment (PAPAS = 81; Z ≈ 0.93) which also correlates strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62); NGSE is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so below-average self-efficacy is a potent risk marker.
- Elevated mesor and resting HR (Mesor Z ≈ 0.7; RHR Z ≈ 0.61) and notable nocturnal heart-rate elevations (Zs up to ≈1.38) — physiological markers that, in this sample, correlate with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83) indicating irregular day-to-day rhythms, consistent with higher PSS in this dataset.
- The summary explicitly concludes this participant is likely above the population mean for perceived stress.

Comparative within-population reasoning:
- Strength and relevance of predictive signals: Participant 2’s high-PSQI, high-PAPAS, and low-NGSE are each tied to relatively strong sample-level correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.53, 0.53, and -0.69 respectively). Those are large-effect correlates pointing toward higher perceived stress.
- Participant 1’s strongest stress-related signals (subjective sleep disturbance, extreme night-to-night sleep variability, blunted circadian amplitude, modest trait anxiety) include one very large Z (sleep variability Z = 3.37) but, in this dataset, several of these features either have only modest correlations with PSS (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.16, STAI r ≈ 0.31) or are partly offset by strong protective signals.
- Protective factors are more numerous/robust for Participant 1: low tonic cardiac arousal (low mesor and RHR), low intradaily variability (Z = -1.73), frequent exercise (Z = 1.58) and high socializing (Z = 1.74), and above-average self-esteem — each of which are associated with lower PSS to varying degrees. These buffering signals are explicitly used in the summary to qualify the P1 inference as only “somewhat above” the mean.
- Participant 2 has some protective factors (mild GAD-7, long median sleep duration, low IV) but the most strongly PSS-linked variables (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE, nocturnal HR) point coherently toward elevated stress, and the summary characterizes their stress level as “likely above the population mean” and “moderately elevated.”

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Both participants are interpreted by their summaries as above their respective population means.
- The evidence for elevated PSS in Participant 2 is stronger in magnitude and coherence because multiple measures with relatively large sample-level correlations to PSS are elevated/abnormal (pain, subjective sleep, self-efficacy, nocturnal HR).
- Participant 1 shows mixed signals with important protective/attenuating features that the summary considers sufficient to limit the elevation to “somewhat above” mean rather than clearly moderate-to-high.

8,74899,20,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.59)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52, Z = +1.06). STAI trait correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.31) and is flagged as a primary contributor.  
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 17, Z = +0.38; classified “Depressed”), correlated with PSS (r = 0.28).  
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05), a known correlate of higher PSS.  
- Objective sleep pattern: late sleep timing (~02:25 AM) and short median sleep (5 h 58 min, Z = −1.52), consistent with stress-related sleep disruption (even though sleep-duration ↔ PSS correlation in this sample is minimal).  
- Circadian fragmentation: higher intradaily variability (Z = +0.46, r ≈ +0.16) and lower 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = −0.19, r ≈ −0.17), patterns associated with higher PSS.  
- Physiological signs of activation: modestly elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ +0.47 and +0.95) and pronounced evening HR deviation (+22.1, Z = +1.69), which can reflect stress‑related arousal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.08)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 8) with a very strong sample correlation to PSS (r = 0.77). Even a mild absolute score here is highly predictive given the high r.  
- High emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = +0.63) with strong correlation to PSS (r = 0.66).  
- Low self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.44) which is strongly negatively correlated with PSS (r = −0.65), meaning lower NGSE predicts higher PSS.  
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13; r = 0.49) and objective sleep that is extremely limited (median 1 h 39 min, Z = −1.27) and very late onset (~04:36 AM). Nocturnal/early‑morning heart‑rate elevations (1–8 AM, several hours with Z > 1) correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).  
- Wearable-derived circadian/physiological profile consistent with stress: elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.19, +1.24), high intradaily variability (Z = +1.07), reduced amplitude (Z = −1.05), and low interdaily stability—indicating a blunted, fragmented rhythm linked to higher PSS.  
- Pain/interference measures (PEG, PAPAS) showing moderate positive correlations with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).

Comparative reasoning within each participant’s population frame
- Both participants are interpreted by their study summaries as having PSS above their cohort means.  
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s top predictors (GAD‑7, emotional lability, NGSE, PSQI) have much larger sample correlations with PSS (r values up to ~0.77, 0.66, −0.65, 0.49) than Participant 1’s strongest predictors (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES‑D r ≈ 0.28, PSQI implied smaller). Thus deviations in Participant 2 map onto PSS more strongly in their cohort.  
- Magnitude and extremity of objective deviations: Participant 2 shows more extreme Z‑scores on physiological and circadian metrics (resting HR and MESOR Z ≈ +1.2; intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.07; amplitude Z ≈ −1.05) and extremely short objective sleep (Z ≈ −1.27). Participant 1 has several elevated markers but generally smaller Z magnitudes (several around +0.4 to +1.0, with one large evening HR deviation Z = +1.69).  
- Coherence of evidence: Participant 2 presents multiple independent, strongly correlated self‑report and wearable indicators all pointing toward elevated perceived stress (anxiety, affect lability, low self‑efficacy, severe subjective and objective sleep disturbance, nocturnal HR elevation, circadian blunting). Participant 1’s signal is mixed—there are important stress‑consistent findings (trait anxiety, depression, poor sleep, circadian fragmentation) but also several protective factors (frequent exercise, high self‑rated health, high interpersonal trust) and generally weaker predictor correlations.  
- Potential measurement caveats: Participant 2’s extremely short objective sleep could reflect recording artifact (noted in the summary), which would temper confidence; however, many other independent and highly correlated self‑report measures also point to elevated stress, which reduces the likelihood that artifact alone explains the profile.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows a denser, more internally consistent constellation of strong predictors of higher PSS (both high‑correlation self‑report measures and multiple wearable indices with larger Z deviations). Even allowing for caveats about possible sleep measurement artifacts, the combination of high‑r predictors (especially GAD‑7, emotional lability, low self‑efficacy) and corroborating physiological/circadian dysregulation makes it more likely that Participant 2’s PSS is higher relative to their study mean than Participant 1’s is relative to theirs.  
- Participant 1 is above their population mean but with smaller effect sizes on key predictors and substantial mitigating/protective factors, producing a less extreme inferred elevation.

2,19245,38,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evident in description)
- Very high clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 21, Z = +2.04). GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Substantially poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +1.49) and objective extreme short sleep (median ≈ 3 h 42 min) with large night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min). Severe sleep restriction is a powerful driver of perceived stress.
- Elevated pain and pain-related interference (PEG-3/PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28), which is highly stressful and correlates with higher PSS.
- Marked emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42), and low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29) — both are strong psychosocial contributors to higher perceived stress.
- Wearable circadian disruption (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability) and nocturnal heart-rate elevations around sleep onset that have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), supporting an integrated self-report + physiology signal of high stress.
- Although there are some protective features (low substance-use problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR), these are fewer and smaller in magnitude than the multiple large risk indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evident in description)
- Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES-D and STAI both ≈ +1.3 SD), measures that moderately correlate with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI >5), very late median sleep onset (02:38) and substantial night-to-night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.23), reduced circadian stability—all consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Low happiness and trust (z ≈ -1.6 to -2.1) and elevated late-evening heart-rate deviations (z up to +2.25) suggesting nocturnal activation consistent with stress.
- However, there are several substantial protective/mitigating features: objectively long median sleep (≈8 h 6 min, z ≈ +1.14), low resting HR and mesor (z ≈ -1.0), regular exercise, robust social/leisure engagement, frequent napping (z +2.27) that could reflect coping or compensate for late sleep timing, and strong academic performance. These buffers plausibly reduce net perceived stress compared with what the affective symptoms alone would predict.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Magnitude and number of high-risk indicators: Participant 1 shows multiple very large standardized effects (several Zs > +2 and one ≤ -2 for low self-efficacy) across anxiety, sleep, pain, and emotional lability. Participant 2’s elevations are generally more moderate (~+1 to +1.35 SD) for affective symptoms, with some high-magnitude items that could either reflect stress (late-night HR z up to +2.25, naps z +2.27) but also strong protective factors (objective long sleep, fitness/exercise, social/leisure) that blunt net stress impact.
- Strength of correlations to PSS in each profile: Key measures elevated in Participant 1 (GAD-7, PSQI, nocturnal HR deviations) have stronger correlations with PSS in that study (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71 and nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.48–0.51). Participant 2’s elevated measures have weaker correlations with PSS in that study (CES-D/STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and several elevated items in Participant 2 are partially offset by protective behaviors that are themselves associated with lower perceived stress.
- Objective physiological burden: Participant 1’s extremely short sleep (≈3.7 h median) is a severe physiological stressor likely to amplify perceived stress markedly; Participant 2’s objective long sleep and lower RHR point toward physiological resilience despite circadian irregularity.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective sample means, but the intensity, breadth, and PSS-relevant correlations of Participant 1’s risk indicators (severe anxiety, extreme sleep restriction, high pain/interference, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) are greater and more convergent than Participant 2’s mixture of moderate affective elevations plus several substantial protective factors.
- Therefore, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

5,56543,14,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very severe and objectively-confirmed sleep disruption: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h and very large night-to-night sleep-timing variability (sleep timing SD Z = 2.82); PSQI = 13.5 (“Disturbed Sleep”). These sleep metrics are strongly correlated with PSS in the sample (e.g., PSQI r = 0.50) and are unusually extreme relative to the study mean.
- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD-7 = 9 (mild but relevant) and BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = 0.43; both measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (GAD r = 0.78; emotional lability r = 0.68).
- Substance-related problems and pain interference: Substance subscale Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS — additional likely stress drivers.
- Circadian/physiologic instability consistent with poorer adaptation: reduced interdaily stability (Z = -1.42), low amplitude (Z = -1.10), and reduced 24h autocorrelation — these rhythm disruptions modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Multiple high-PSS–correlated indicators converge (sleep, anxiety, emotional lability, substance issues), increasing confidence in an above-mean inference.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI Z = 0.86 and CES-D Z = 0.49; both positively correlated with PSS (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28).
- Poor subjective sleep and late timing: PSQI Z = 1.05 and median sleep start ≈ 02:22; sleep duration below sample mean (6 h 26 min, Z = -0.94).
- Elevated baseline autonomic activation: resting HR Z = 1.17 and mesor Z = 1.14, which modestly correlate with PSS.
- Very large late-evening physiological arousal: extreme hourly heart-rate deviation at 10–11 pm (Z ≈ 5.94), consistent with sustained evening activation that can drive perceived stress and poor sleep.
- Behavioral contributors: high daily internet use (Z = 2.19) and modest intradaily variability, which can perpetuate evening arousal and stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame (both descriptions are relative to their own population means)
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective population mean PSS (Participant 1 vs mean 21.33; Participant 2 vs mean 21.61). The question is which shows a stronger signal of elevated perceived stress relative to their peers.
- Strength and directness of high-PSS correlates: Participant 1’s profile includes multiple measures that (a) are strongly correlated with PSS in that study (GAD r = 0.78; emotional lability r = 0.68; PSQI r = 0.50) and (b) are extreme (very short objective sleep ≈ 3 h, high sleep-timing variability, substance problems). These are direct, high-weight indicators in the study’s correlation structure.
- Participant 2 shows a clear above-mean signal too (elevated STAI/CES-D, poor PSQI, elevated RHR/mesor, very large evening HR spike). However, many of these associations are more moderate in their correlations with PSS in that dataset (e.g., STAI/CES-D correlations ~0.3; RHR r ≈ 0.13), and several protective behaviors (regular exercise, no substance use, higher interdaily stability, reading) are plausibly buffering perceived stress.
- Extremity: Participant 1’s objective sleep deficit (median ≈ 3 h) is an extreme deviation likely to drive very high perceived stress; Participant 2’s most extreme single signal is the late-evening HR spike (Z ≈ 5.94), which indicates pronounced evening autonomic activation but is one physiological domain amid several protective behaviors.
- Convergence: Participant 1 has multiple convergent, strongly PSS-related problems (sleep, anxiety/lability, substance problems, circadian instability) that together form a tight multi-domain signal of elevated perceived stress. Participant 2 has a mixed profile with both notable risk signs and several substantive protective factors.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Given the severity and multiplicity of high-PSS–correlated indicators in Participant 1 (especially the objectively extreme sleep loss plus anxiety and substance-related issues) versus the more mixed risk/protective profile in Participant 2 (moderate psychological symptoms, marked evening arousal but also exercise, no substance use, high reading/leisure), Participant 1 likely exhibits the worse overall perceived stress relative to their respective study population.

20,22455,21,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Wearable-derived circadian disruption: reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), and mildly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). In this cohort these features modestly correlate with higher PSS (amplitude r ≈ -0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.16; IV r ≈ +0.16).
- Shorter and more variable sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 6 h 7 min (Z ≈ -1.33) with elevated sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94); shorter/variable sleep is linked to greater stress (small positive correlations with PSS).
- High sedentary/leisure screen time (TV Z ≈ +2.54) that is weakly associated with higher PSS.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (very large positive deviations 5–7 AM) that are physiologically atypical—could reflect early awakenings, early exercise, or other behavior linked to stress (interpretation uncertain).

Notes: These indicators are generally modest predictors of PSS in the sample and are contrasted by stronger self-report signals that point toward lower stress for this participant.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Elevated anxiety: GAD-7 = 10 (clinical threshold); GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.77). This is a very strong predictor of higher PSS.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 13.5 (poor sleep) with PSQI–PSS correlation ≈ 0.49.
- Pain and pain interference: PEG-3 = 7.89 and PAPAS = 86; pain measures correlate moderately with PSS (~0.45–0.49) and indicate substantial functional burden.
- Elevated emotional lability: BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9; strongly associated with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.66).
- Wearable-derived sleep/circadian risk: very short median sleep (≈ 3 h 55 min), reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -1.51) and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.75); these objective patterns support higher stress risk.
- Hourly HR deviations and compressed/shifted rest-activity profile consistent with dysregulated daily rhythm.

Protective/mitigating factors for Participant 2 (noted but outweighed): high general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +1.41; r ≈ -0.68 with PSS), relatively low interpersonal problems, and lower resting HR/mesor—these attenuate risk but do not fully counterbalance the strong anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, and emotional lability signals.

Comparative weighing (within each study’s frame)
- Magnitude and relevance of predictors: Participant 2 displays multiple strong self-report predictors that have large correlations with PSS in their sample (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77 and emotional lability r ≈ 0.66). These are high-weight signals for above-mean PSS.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals toward higher PSS are primarily wearable-derived circadian/sleep disruptions and elevated screen time; these features have only small-to-modest correlations with PSS in that cohort and are counterbalanced by several robust self-report indicators of low distress (low trait anxiety, favorable depression, high happiness/health satisfaction).
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s dominant, high-weight self-report indicators point toward below-mean perceived stress, with wearable signals providing modest counter-evidence. Participant 2 shows multiple, high-weight, concordant indicators of elevated perceived stress (anxiety, poor sleep, pain, emotional lability), with some protective factors but insufficient to overturn the risk pattern.

- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11; z = 1.98) plus relatively short sleep duration (~6 h 38 min; z ≈ −0.68). PSQI correlates with PSS and poor sleep quality typically elevates perceived stress.  
- Objective signs of circadian/physiological dysregulation: elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.60), reduced amplitude and interdaily stability, and a pronounced morning heart-rate surge (8–9 AM deviation z ≈ 2.09). These features are described as associated with greater stress burden in this sample.  
- Additional self-report signals consistent with higher stress: higher internet use (z = 1.52) and lower reported happiness (z ≈ −0.53).

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have lower perceived stress (resilience factors)
- Regular solitary exercise (z = 1.07) and relatively low resting HR (58.6 bpm) that can be protective.  
- Relatively stable sleep timing and low night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = −0.85).  
- Moderate socializing and good academic performance and health satisfaction that may buffer stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5) and pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS elevated), both of which correlate positively with PSS in the sample.  
- Interpersonal strain elevated (BASIS-24 interpersonal z = 1.54) and mildly elevated resting HR/mesor (z ≈ 1.2) that could reflect some basal arousal.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have lower perceived stress (resilience factors)
- High general self-efficacy (NGSE = 38; z = 1.41). NGSE has a strong inverse correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ −0.63) and is a potent protective factor.  
- Very robust circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability z = 2.13, autocorrelation z = 1.57, amplitude z = 1.73, low intradaily variability z = −1.05) and low emotional lability (z = −0.67), both associated with lower stress.  
- Low substance-use problems (z = −1.62) and long objective sleep duration (~9 h 41 min; z = 1.47) despite poor subjective sleep.  
- Anxiety is only mild (GAD-7 = 5.5), and the dataset shows strong ties between GAD-7 and PSS; Participant 2’s low GAD-7 reduces the predicted PSS risk.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both descriptions are given relative to their own sample means (P1 mean 21.61; P2 mean 21.38), and those means are very similar. P1 is characterized explicitly as above the population mean (moderately elevated), with several convergent, moderately-to-strongly elevated risk indicators (notably CES-D and PSQI) and objective physiological signs consistent with higher stress. P2 is characterized as near or slightly below the population mean: although there are some risk factors (PSQI, pain, interpersonal strain), the participant also shows strong protective factors—most importantly high NGSE and pronounced circadian/behavioral regularity—which the summary argues likely offset the risks and predict PSS near or below the sample mean.  
- The magnitude and correlation strength of P1’s risk indicators (large CES-D z, high PSQI z, physiological fragmentation and morning HR surge) appear more directly and consistently tied to higher PSS in this sample than P2’s risk indicators, which are counterbalanced by a very strong protective factor (NGSE) that has one of the largest inverse correlations with PSS in the dataset.

Overall judgement
- On balance, Participant 1’s profile indicates a clearer and more convergent pattern of factors associated with above-mean perceived stress, whereas Participant 2’s profile contains substantial protective resources that likely keep perceived stress near or below their sample mean. Given the similar population means, Participant 1 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the higher absolute perceived stress.

11,79341,24,15,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean = 21.63)
- Trait anxiety (STAI = 41) — correlates positively with PSS in that sample.
- Very low momentary positive affect (self-rated “Happy” z ≈ -1.61).
- Late sleep timing (~01:50) and moderately short sleep (median ~6 h 46 m, z ≈ -0.51).
- Slightly elevated intradaily variability in heart rate (z ≈ 0.32) and behavioral patterns (high video-game time) that can co-occur with stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a lower (or not elevated) PSS
- Strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24h autocorrelation both z ≈ +0.9), which correlate negatively with PSS.
- Low resting heart rate (48.3 bpm, z ≈ -1.18), suggesting lower sympathetic tone.
- Reasonable subjective sleep quality (PSQI ~5, z ≈ -0.8), frequent exercise, and low substance use.
- Integrated judgment in the description: overall near to modestly below the study mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean = 20.92)
- Severe anxiety (GAD-7 = 16, z = 1.16) — very strongly correlated with PSS in that sample.
- High PSQI (poor subjective sleep), elevated pain interference (PEG-3), and emotional lability — all positively associated with PSS.
- Very short and very late sleep (median ~2 h 58 m, sleep start ~02:23), large night-to-night variability.
- Marked circadian disruption: low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, low 24h autocorrelation and reduced amplitude.
- Nocturnal heart-rate elevations during typical sleep hours that correlate positively with PSS.
- Low self-efficacy (NGSE z = -1.55), a strong negative correlate of PSS, indicating fewer coping resources.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might not have elevated PSS
- Some baseline cardiovascular indices (resting HR, MESOR) are slightly below mean and daytime HR shows periods of lower-than-mesor values; these are ambiguous and not strongly predictive of PSS in this dataset.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is judged as near-to-slightly-below their sample mean PSS (mixed signals, physiological resilience vs modest subjective distress). Participant 2 is judged clearly above their sample mean PSS (convergent strong signals: severe anxiety, profound sleep/circadian disruption, nocturnal physiological arousal, low self-efficacy).
- The strength and convergence of high-risk indicators are much greater for Participant 2 (multiple high z-scores on highly PSS-correlated instruments and corroborating wearable physiology) than for Participant 1 (some subjective signals but countervailing objective resilience markers).
- Even accounting for differences in population SDs and that each judgment is within-sample, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 has higher perceived stress relative to their peers than Participant 1 has relative to theirs.

13,82986,28,19,"Participant 1 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean = 20.75)
- Strong self-report risk signals that are highly correlated with PSS in this sample: mild anxiety (GAD‑7 = 7.5; GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80), emotional lability (BASIS‑24 r ≈ 0.67), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; PSQI r ≈ 0.59). These have large predictive weight for higher PSS.
- Pain and functional interference (PEG‑3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50), adding to perceived burden.
- Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations during late-night hours that, in this sample, associate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r ≈ 0.45), suggesting autonomic arousal during sleep linked to stress.
- Integrative judgment in the description explicitly infers perceived stress above the population mean, citing the above survey-based drivers as dominant despite some protective physiology.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean = 21.62)
- Marked objective physiological/circadian risk: very short median sleep (5 h 6 min; Z ≈ −2.6), late sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:24), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −1.04), greater fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.46), and elevated MESOR and resting HR (resting HR Z ≈ 1.03). These objective features are associated with increased physiological strain and, in this sample, modestly with higher PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) amplifies the risk from short/irregular sleep.
- The description notes these wearable-derived features are known contributors to increased stress burden and could raise perceived stress over time.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and balance of evidence
- Framing: each participant’s description is calibrated to their own study mean. Participant 1’s profile is explicitly interpreted as likely above their population mean ( > 20.75). Participant 2’s profile is interpreted as near-to-slightly-below their population mean (≈ ≤ 21.62).
- Strength and direction of signals: Participant 1’s elevation inference rests primarily on multiple strong self-report predictors of PSS (high correlations: GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80, PSQI r ≈ 0.59, Emotional Lability r ≈ 0.67). These survey measures are the strongest, most direct predictors of perceived stress in that dataset and are coherently elevated.
- Participant 2 shows a stronger objective-physiology signal for risk (very short sleep, circadian disruption, higher resting HR), but the description emphasizes that correlations between those wearable metrics and PSS are only modest in this sample and that the participant’s subjective reports (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem/happiness) strongly favor lower perceived stress.
- Because PSS is a subjective measure and because Participant 1’s self-report measures that most tightly predict PSS are elevated—whereas Participant 2’s subjective measures strongly oppose elevated PSS despite physiological risk—the balance of evidence favors Participant 1 as having the higher perceived stress relative to their peers.

23,19245,17,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Clinically poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5), a measure that correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r = 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep (median ~4 h 21 m) and large night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min), both of which are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress.
- Marked overnight heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z > 1), with the 1–2 AM deviation moderately correlated with PSS (r = 0.46), indicating nocturnal physiological arousal that tends to raise PSS.
- Overall, the sleep- and night-arousal-related signals are the primary evidence that could push this participant’s PSS above their study mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 26, z = +1.32) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, z = +1.35); both are >1 SD above the study mean and are known to co-vary with higher PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) plus very late median sleep onset (02:38) and high night-to-night variability (sleep SD z ≈ +1.23), indicating circadian/sleep disruptions linked to higher perceived stress.
- Low interdaily stability and flattened circadian amplitude (reduced rhythm regularity), which are associated with greater perceived stress in the sample.
- Elevated late-evening/early-night heart-rate deviations (z’s up to +2.25) consistent with physiological activation at hours for winding down.
- Low happiness/trust scores and increased daytime napping, which align with affective distress and dysregulated sleep–wake patterns.
- Although participant 2 has some protective factors (longer total sleep duration, low RHR, exercise/social activity), the combination of multiple high-loading affective measures and corroborating circadian/physiological signals points toward higher-than-average PSS in their study sample.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Each description is framed relative to its own population mean. We should therefore weigh the strength and number of within-sample indicators that predict higher PSS for each participant.
- Participant 1: strongest signals are sleep-related (PSQI, short sleep, nocturnal HR deviations) with moderate correlations to PSS; however, several high-weight daytime/trait measures (very low GAD-7 with r = 0.77 to PSS, relatively high self-efficacy with r = -0.65) strongly predict lower PSS. The summary explicitly infers P1 is likely below their population mean PSS (21.21).
- Participant 2: multiple affective measures are >1 SD above the mean and several circadian/sleep and physiological signals corroborate elevated distress. The summary explicitly infers P2 is likely above their population mean PSS (21.6). Although P2 has protective features, the number and magnitude of risk indicators (affective + rhythm + physiological) are greater than for P1.
- Comparing the balance of evidence within each participant’s study frame, Participant 2 presents a larger and more consistent set of predictors of elevated perceived stress, while Participant 1’s high-risk signals are more circumscribed (mostly sleep/nighttime) and are counterbalanced by strong protective daytime/trait indicators.

Decision
- Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) relative to their study population.

19,19735,28,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their sample)
- Substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 2.15), and depressive symptoms are positively associated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.29).
- Above‑average trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.56), which also correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and very late sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:01 AM) — both linked to elevated stress in the literature and modestly correlated with PSS in this sample.
- Very low social engagement (socializing Z ≈ -2.2), consistent with withdrawal or low support that can accompany higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity indicated by low 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.95), which modestly associates with higher PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their sample)
- Very pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ 1.0) and objective evidence of severe sleep loss (median sleep ≈ 2 h 38 m) and extreme night‑to‑night sleep onset variability (SD Z ≈ 1.3). PSQI and sleep disruption have a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.47).
- Physiological nocturnal arousal: elevated overnight heart‑rate deviations (Z ≈ 1.17–1.59) that are moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant moderate anxiety (GAD‑7 = 10). Anxiety scores have a very strong positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78), making even modest elevations potentially important.
- Pain/interference (PAPAS) has a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.48) and is modestly elevated.

Comparative, within‑population framing and weighing the evidence
- Both participants are described as above their respective population means. The choice is which profile implies a larger deviation in perceived stress relative to its local normative distribution.
- Participant 1’s strongest single deviation is very high depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = 2.15) and very low socializing (Z ≈ -2.2). These are large-magnitude deviations in predictors of PSS, but in this dataset depression’s correlation with PSS is only moderate (r ≈ 0.29). Participant 1 also has several protective physiological signals (adequate objective sleep duration, low resting HR, high circadian amplitude) that temper the inference.
- Participant 2 shows multiple convergent signals that are directly tied to PSS with moderate-to-strong correlations in this sample: pronounced subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI), severe objective sleep loss/irregularity, and physiological nocturnal arousal; additionally, anxiety and pain measures that are known here to track strongly with PSS. Although some trait resilience markers (self‑efficacy, low emotional lability) mitigate risk, the core stress‑linked features (sleep disruption + nocturnal arousal + anxiety/pain) are numerous and are among the measures with stronger correlations to PSS in this dataset (notably PSQI r ≈ 0.47 and GAD r ≈ 0.78).
- In sum: Participant 1 has one very large psychological deviation (depression) plus behavioral withdrawal, offset partially by protective physiological markers. Participant 2 has a broader cluster of stress‑relevant abnormalities (especially severe sleep pathology and physiological arousal) in measures that in this sample show stronger associations with PSS.

Overall determination
- Taking into account magnitude of deviations, the number of converging stress‑linked signals, and the strength of those signals’ correlations with PSS within each study population, Participant 2’s profile is more consistent with a higher perceived stress level relative to their sample mean than Participant 1’s profile is relative to theirs.

  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.49).
- Pain and functional interference: PEG‑3 average 6.78 and PAPAS composite (z = 0.24) — both positively correlated with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r = 0.48).
- Objective circadian/sleep instability consistent with stress: low interdaily stability (z = −0.68), low 24‑hr autocorrelation (z = −0.35), and very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD = 273 min, z = 1.7) — these wearable markers are typically associated with higher PSS.
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal z = 0.54) that can add to perceived stress.

Overall the profile was judged most consistent with being slightly above (but not dramatically above) the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean = 21.65)
- Wearable-derived circadian dysregulation and fragmentation — measures that in the population modestly associate with higher PSS:
  - Low interdaily stability (0.28, z = −1.07)
  - Reduced 24‑hr autocorrelation (z = −0.87)
  - Elevated intradaily variability (z = 0.74)
  - Attenuated amplitude (z = −1.03)
  - Pronounced morning HR peak (6–7 am, z = 3.07) — though correlations with PSS are small-to-moderate (r ≈ 0.14–0.23).
- These wearable signals are described as the strongest objective indicators that could push stress upward for this participant.

Counterpoints (strong protective factors): multiple robust self-report indicators linked to lower stress — very low trait anxiety (STAI Z = −1.71), low depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = −1.07), high happiness (Z = 1.64), high health satisfaction (Z = 2.05), high self‑esteem (Z = 1.24), good subjective sleep (PSQI = 5, z = −0.8), long median sleep (Z = 1.25), frequent exercise, low substance use, and low resting HR (Z = −0.65). The study summary concludes this profile is most consistent with PSS below the population mean.

Comparative within‑population reasoning and weight of evidence
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s elevated anxiety and very poor subjective sleep are high‑weight predictors of PSS in that study (GAD‑7 r = 0.78; PSQI r = 0.49). Participant 1 also shows objective sleep/circadian irregularity and pain interference, reinforcing the above‑mean inference.
- Participant 2’s indicators that point toward higher PSS are primarily wearable circadian fragmentation metrics; the sample notes these associations are modest (small-to-moderate effect sizes) and are counterbalanced by numerous and large-magnitude self‑report protective signals (very low anxiety/depression, high well‑being, good sleep, healthy behaviors).
- Both summaries explicitly state their inferred relation to their respective population means: Participant 1 is inferred to be slightly above the mean (21.04); Participant 2 is inferred to be below the mean (21.65). Within their own frames, Participant 1 has stronger, higher‑weight signals pointing toward elevated perceived stress than the wearable-only risks present for Participant 2.

- Participant 1 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (relative to their respective study populations).

- Elevated trait affective symptoms: CES‑D = 21 (Z ≈ 0.8, classified “Depressed”) and STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86, “anxious”), both established positive correlates of PSS in this sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Two moderately elevated, correlated affective indicators point toward above‑average perceived stress.
- Circadian / sleep disruption consistent with higher stress: elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.09), reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53), nontrivial sleep timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 99 min), and somewhat short median sleep (6h46, Z ≈ −0.52). These objective rhythm/sleep features are associated (albeit modestly) with higher PSS in the sample.
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29) — given the (negative) correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), this trait likely contributes to greater perceived stress.
- The summary explicitly integrates these factors and concludes a likely moderate elevation in PSS relative to the population mean (21.59).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean)
- Strongly predictive anxiety and sleep problems: GAD‑7 = 6 (mild anxiety) but GAD‑7 has a very high sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.78); PSQI = 13 (marked subjective sleep disturbance) with a moderate/large correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.49). These are highly relevant predictors of higher PSS.
- Objective sleep/circadian instability: very high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD z ≈ 1.7), low interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.68), and low 24‑hr autocorrelation (z ≈ −0.35) — patterns that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG‑3, PAPAS) elevated and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.44–0.48), supporting additional burden that tracks with stress.
- The study summary concludes the participant is most defensibly slightly above their population mean PSS (21.04), though not markedly so.

Comparative weighing (within each participant’s population frame)
- Strength and breadth of risk signals:
  - Participant 1: Multiple affective symptom measures (depression and trait anxiety) are moderately elevated (Z ≈ 0.8–0.86) and together form a consistent signal for higher PSS. Objective circadian fragmentation adds further risk, though correlations for circadian metrics are smaller.
  - Participant 2: Some predictors have very strong sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.78 and PSQI r ≈ 0.49), and the participant shows extreme values on sleep variability (z ≈ 1.7) and severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13). Pain interference adds another moderately strong contributor.
- Strength of protective factors:
  - Participant 1 has robust protective behaviors (frequent exercise Z ≈ 1.1–1.6), no substance use, low resting HR, and modestly higher happiness — these are likely buffering influences and are emphasized in the summary.
  - Participant 2 has a substantial protective factor in self‑efficacy (r ≈ −0.65) and no substance problems; these likely provide a meaningful buffer against stress for this person.
- Net assessment:
  - Participant 1’s profile describes multiple moderately elevated affective traits (depression + trait anxiety) and circadian fragmentation that, despite strong behavioral protections, were judged by the study authors to amount to a moderate elevation in perceived stress relative to their sample mean.
  - Participant 2’s profile includes several high‑leverage predictors (very disturbed subjective sleep, high sleep variability, pain interference, and anxiety) but the authors judged the net to be only slightly above their population mean because of meaningful buffering (notably self‑efficacy) and some ambiguous signs (long median sleep vs poor quality).

Conclusion
- Taking the quantity, magnitude, and the study summaries together, Participant 1 is characterized in the writeup as showing a more robust, clinically consistent elevation in affective burden (depression + trait anxiety) and circadian instability that the authors describe as a ""moderate elevation"" in perceived stress. Participant 2, despite some strong predictors, is characterized as likely only ""slightly above"" their population mean after accounting for strong buffering factors.
- Therefore, Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their study population.

1,87032,17,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study mean):
- Strong risk signals tied to PSS in the sample:
  - Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11.5) and very short objective sleep (median ≈ 3 h 30 min; very late median sleep onset ≈ 03:37 AM). Sleep measures have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSS (e.g., PSQI r ≈ 0.48).
  - Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43), which correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.5).
  - Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (hourly Zs up to ≈ 0.67) and reduced circadian robustness (amplitude Z ≈ −0.34, reduced 24-h autocorrelation), which are positively associated with PSS in the sample.
- These converging sleep/pain/physiologic abnormalities were judged to push the participant’s inferred PSS above the population mean.

Reasons Participant 1 might not have a higher PSS (protective signals):
- Low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ −0.85), and GAD-7 is one of the strongest sample correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.77) — this strongly argues for lower perceived stress.
- High self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86; r with PSS ≈ −0.64) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ −0.97; r with PSS ≈ 0.65) are substantial protective factors.
- Many other rhythm and resting HR metrics are near-average.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study mean):
- Multiple sizable elevations in both psychological and physiological domains that align with higher PSS:
  - Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ +1.53) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.27); CES-D and STAI are described as positively associated with PSS in the sample.
  - Substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52) with late and variable sleep timing (sleep start median ≈ 02:00; start-time SD Z ≈ +1.36).
  - Marked circadian/behavioral irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.15), very low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), and high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.44) — a pattern linked to worse stress outcomes.
  - Elevated average cardiac activity (MESOR Z ≈ +1.56) and higher resting HR (Z ≈ +1.34), both positively correlated with PSS.
- Several of these z-scores cluster around +1.4 to +1.9, indicating broad, moderately large deviations in PSS-relevant domains.

Reasons Participant 2 might not have a higher PSS (protective signals):
- Low substance use, adequate/above-average academic performance (GPA ≈ 3.44–3.5), and preserved self-esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ −0.31) are modest protective factors but are described as weaker correlates with PSS in the sample.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning:
- Both participant summaries conclude “above the population mean,” but the pattern differs:
  - Participant 1 has very severe objective sleep restriction (3.5 h/night) and elevated pain, which are strong risk signals, but these are substantially counterbalanced by large protective psychosocial signals (notably low GAD-7 and high self-efficacy). Crucially, GAD-7 has one of the largest sample correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), so Participant 1’s low anxiety score is a high-weight protective element.
  - Participant 2 shows multiple, moderately-large deviations across psychological symptoms (depression), subjective sleep, circadian regularity, and elevated cardiac tone. Many of these features have moderate sample correlations with PSS and several z-scores are around +1.5 to +1.9, indicating a broad-based elevation in PSS-relevant measures. Participant 2 has fewer high-weight protective signals and more consistent elevation across both self-report and physiology.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Although Participant 1 has an alarming degree of objective sleep restriction, that participant also has very strong protective indicators (especially low GAD-7) that are highly predictive of lower PSS in this sample.
- Participant 2’s profile contains a broader set of moderately large risk deviations across psychological symptom burden, sleep quality/timing, circadian irregularity, and elevated cardiac indices—with several Zs ~+1.5 and one near −1.9 (24-h autocorrelation), showing pervasive dysregulation linked to PSS.
- On net, Participant 2’s combination of elevated depressive symptoms, marked sleep disturbance, circadian fragmentation, and elevated physiological arousal is more consistently and strongly suggestive of higher perceived stress (relative to that study’s mean) than Participant 1’s mixed profile (high sleep/pain risk but strong psychosocial protections).

  - Participant 1: concentrated strong signals (clinical-level anxiety, nocturnal HR arousal, pain) but also notable resilience markers that likely blunt net perceived stress.
  - Participant 2: multiple elevated affective and sleep-risk indicators of substantial magnitude and broader coverage (depression, trait anxiety, worse PSQI, short and very late sleep, reduced amplitude), and fewer strong physiological resilience signals.

Inference
- On balance, Participant 2 presents a broader and somewhat larger constellation of elevated risk indicators tied to perceived stress (notably higher PSQI and CES-D z-scores, very late and shortened sleep, reduced circadian amplitude) and fewer strong physiological buffers than Participant 1. Although Participant 1 has a high-impact anxiety signal and nocturnal HR spikes, the presence of clearer physiological resilience suggests their net PSS elevation may be more moderate than Participant 2’s.

23,34062,17,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Clinically elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ +1.52), a robust correlate of higher PSS in the sample.
- Wearable circadian/sleep fragmentation signals: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.41), low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.87), slightly reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −0.40), and modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.17) — all consistent with rhythm fragmentation that tends to accompany higher perceived stress.
- Variable sleep start times (SD ≈ 95 min) and slightly elevated nap use (Z ≈ +0.82), factors that correlate positively with PSS in the dataset.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5) and very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min), both of which are associated with elevated perceived stress.
- Large variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min) indicating irregular sleep opportunity.
- Marked nocturnal heart-rate elevations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +12–15 bpm; z > 1) with a moderate positive correlation to PSS (1–2 AM deviation r ≈ 0.46); nocturnal arousal is a meaningful risk signal for higher perceived stress.

Comparative/integrative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame)
- Participant 1’s sleep/circadian signals point toward elevated stress, but these are counterbalanced by multiple protective, strongly functional indicators (low depression and trait anxiety z-scores, high self‑esteem and happiness, regular exercise, very low resting HR z ≈ −1.48 and low mesor z ≈ −2.08). The summary explicitly infers P1’s PSS is near or slightly below their population mean (21.6) — i.e., not markedly elevated relative to peers.
- Participant 2 also shows strong sleep-related risk signals (very short objective sleep, poor PSQI, nocturnal HR arousal). However, the daytime/trait signals that predict PSS in their sample are particularly strong: very low GAD-7 (z ≈ −1.29) where GAD-7 correlates highly with PSS (r ≈ 0.77), and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE; r ≈ −0.65). Circadian regularity metrics are also strongly positive (interdaily stability z ≈ 1.98). The official integration concludes P2 is likely below their population mean (21.21), with sleep-specific disturbances being a localized risk but not outweighing robust protective signals.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants show mixed profiles, but their study-specific integrations differ in degree: Participant 1 is assessed as approximately at or slightly below their mean (i.e., closer to average/less protected), whereas Participant 2 is assessed as more clearly below their mean (i.e., lower perceived stress overall) despite pronounced sleep problems.
- The protective signals in Participant 2 are tied to measures that have large sample-level correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 and NGSE), making the inference of lower PSS for P2 relatively strong. In contrast, Participant 1’s protective signals are present but the overall profile was judged nearer the population mean.
- Therefore, relative to their own populations, Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the higher perceived stress.

8,70125,20,29,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Elevated mood/anxiety symptoms: CES‑D = 24 (Z ≈ 1.11, classified “Depressed”) and STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86, “anxious”). Both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).  
- Sleep disturbance and circadian disruption: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep), very late median sleep onset (~01:44), high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z ≈ 1.32), and reduced heart‑rate circadian regularity (interdaily stability, amplitude, 24‑h autocorrelation all below average). These features are associated with elevated PSS (sleep variability r ≈ 0.13; circadian disruption conceptually linked to stress).  
- Low social trust and lower health satisfaction (Zs ≈ -1.74 and -0.95), which can increase vulnerability to perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Strongly correlated self‑report predictors: GAD‑7 = 8 (anxiety; r with PSS = 0.77), emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 0.63; r = 0.66), low self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44; r with PSS = -0.65), and PSQI = 13 (r = 0.49). These measures have large sample correlations with PSS and several show meaningful deviation from the mean.  
- Substantial physiological/circadian deviations consistent with hyperarousal: elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.19 and 1.24), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ -1.05), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.07), low interdaily stability, and pronounced early‑morning HR elevations (1–8 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).  
- Objective sleep pattern highly abnormal: median nightly sleep ≈ 1 h 39 min (Z ≈ -1.27) and extremely late median sleep start (~04:36 AM), with naps increased (Z ≈ 1.24). Short/late sleep combined with nocturnal HR elevation aligns with nocturnal hyperarousal and higher perceived stress.  
- Pain/interference measures that correlate moderately with PSS (PEG r = 0.44; PAPAS r ≈ 0.48), adding another contributing domain.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are interpreted as having PSS above their study population means in their respective summaries. The populations’ mean PSS values are similar (21.6 vs 21.08), so direct baseline differences in population mean are negligible for this comparison.  
- The critical difference is strength and number of high‑weight indicators: Participant 1’s strongest predictors (CES‑D, STAI) have only moderate correlations with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and several protective factors are present (very high self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR) that moderate the inference. Participant 1’s circadian/sleep abnormalities are notable but their correlations with PSS are smaller.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple predictors that both deviate meaningfully from their sample mean and have large sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD‑7 r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, self‑efficacy r = -0.65, PSQI r = 0.49). Participant 2 also has stronger wearable/circadian deviations that align with hyperarousal (elevated MESOR/resting HR, large amplitude/intradaily variability effects, early‑morning HR elevation) and an extremely short/late sleep pattern — all of which are independently and jointly consistent with a higher perceived stress state. While some wearable signals could reflect artifact (noted in the summary), the convergence of multiple high‑correlation self‑report measures with physiological signs strengthens the inference.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 presents a larger number of strong, high‑correlation indicators of perceived stress (both subjective and physiological), and fewer robust protective factors.  
- Participant 1 has important risk signals (depressive and trait‑anxiety elevations, sleep/circadian irregularity) but also clear protective buffers (very high self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR) and generally weaker correlations between their deviating measures and PSS in that sample.

Determination
{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",70125,NetHealth,29,8,Pain,20
1,43794,17,26,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = +1.35), a strong self-report correlate of PSS in the sample.
- Elevated resting heart rate (70.8 bpm, Z = +1.50), indicating greater autonomic arousal that correlates with stress.
- Marked circadian dysregulation: very low interdaily stability (Z = −1.73) and blunted amplitude (Z = −1.76), which signal ongoing physiological irregularity linked with higher PSS.
- Disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8, Z ≈ +0.59) and high night-to-night variability in sleep timing/duration (sleep duration SD Z = +1.25; sleep start SD Z = +0.86), which are associated with stress.
- Lower self-reported happiness and self-esteem (Zs −0.53 and −0.87), consistent with elevated perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Severely restricted objective sleep (median nightly sleep = 3 h 30 min) and very late sleep timing (median start ≈ 03:37 AM) — extreme abnormalities that are strongly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5; described as “Disturbed Sleep”), a measure with a moderate–strong correlation to PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3 Z = +1.33; PAPAS Z = +0.43), both moderately correlated with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Nocturnal heart‑rate elevations (hourly Z up to ~0.67 around late-night/early-morning), indicating physiological arousal during usual sleep hours and correlating with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.43).
- Reduced circadian robustness (reduced amplitude and autocorrelation), adding to the physiological pattern linked with higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both summaries state the participant is likely above their study’s population mean PSS. Important to judge relative strength and convergence of predictors within each cohort:
  - Participant 1 shows several moderately-to-strong abnormal signals across affective (trait anxiety Z +1.35), autonomic (resting HR Z +1.50), and circadian domains (amplitude and interdaily stability ~ −1.7 SD). These are multiple, convergent indicators of elevated stress relative to their cohort, though subjective depressive symptoms are low and sleep duration is near average.
  - Participant 2 shows extremely large sleep-related abnormalities (objective median sleep 3.5 h, very late timing, high PSQI) and elevated pain — these are highly salient, large-magnitude risk signals with moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS. However, Participant 2 also has strong psychosocial protective signals (low GAD-7 Z ≈ −0.85, high self-efficacy Z ≈ +0.86), which meaningfully counterbalance risk indicators because GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.77).

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple moderate-to-large physiological and affective deviations (trait anxiety, resting HR, and marked circadian blunting) consistently point above the cohort mean. The evidence is spread across domains (psychological, autonomic, circadian) and several Z-scores are ~±1.3–1.8 SD from the mean.
- Participant 2: extremely severe, concentrated abnormalities in sleep duration/timing and elevated pain — these are large, directly stress-relevant signals (objective sleep 3.5 h is an extreme deviation and PSQI = 11.5 is high). Although there are strong psychological protections (low anxiety, high self-efficacy), the magnitude and directness of the sleep/pain/nocturnal-arousal abnormalities suggest a higher immediate burden of perceived stressors.

Decision
- On balance, the evidence that most strongly predicts elevated perceived stress is more extreme and focal for Participant 2 (very short objective sleep, very disturbed PSQI, elevated pain, nocturnal HR elevations). Those abnormalities are large, convergent, and are known to drive higher PSS even when some psychosocial protections are present. Participant 1 has multiple concerning signals across domains but they are somewhat more moderate in behavioral impact (e.g., near-seven-hour median sleep, no depression) and include some mitigating features.

- Strong anxiety signal: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.90) and GAD-7 has a very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.80).  
- Severe objective sleep disruption: extremely short median nightly sleep (2 h 19 min; Z = −1.04), very late/variable sleep onset (start-time SD Z = 1.16), and PSQI = 13 (disturbed). Sleep features that are strongly linked to PSS in this sample.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = −1.57), high intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), and marked nighttime HR elevations (+8–9 bpm at midnight–2 AM) that show positive correlations with PSS. These objective signals converge with the sleep disruption to indicate higher arousal and disrupted recovery.  
- Pain and emotional lability: elevated PEG-3 / pain-related burden and BASIS-24 emotional lability (Z = 0.33) both correlate positively with PSS and add to stress burden.  
- Correlations strengthen inference: several of the elevated measures for this participant are ones that have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that study (notably GAD-7, PSQI, pain metrics, some nocturnal HR deviations).  
- Protective factor is small: modestly higher self-efficacy (Z = 0.12) provides some buffering but appears insufficient relative to the severity/consistency of the other signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety and subjective sleep complaints: STAI = 44 (Z = 0.27) and PSQI = 8 (Z = 0.59), both associated with higher PSS in the cohort.  
- Pronounced circadian/behavioral irregularity: very low interdaily stability (Z = −1.56) and high sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.48), patterns linked to greater perceived stress.  
- Some physiological indicators of higher tone: modestly elevated MESOR (Z = 0.46) and positive evening/night HR deviations, which can accompany stress-related arousal.  
- Lower momentary happiness and slightly reduced self-esteem (happiness Z = −0.53, Rosenberg Z ≈ −0.17) which align with higher PSS in sample-level correlations.

Comparative framing (each relative to its own population mean)
- Both summaries infer PSS above their respective population means, but the magnitude and consistency of stress-linked deviations differ. Participant 1 shows large, concordant elevations on measures that have strong sample-level associations with PSS (notably high anxiety, extremely short/irregular sleep, pronounced nocturnal HR elevations, and pain). Many of these deviations are sizable (multiple Zs ≈ |1.0–1.7|) and include features with strong correlations to PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.80).  
- Participant 2 also shows indicators of elevated stress (trait anxiety, disturbed PSQI, very low interdaily stability), but several strong protective/offsetting features are present within that cohort: relatively long objective sleep duration (8 h, Z = 1.01), frequent sports participation (Z = 1.58), normal depressive symptom levels, and typical resting HR. The stress-relevant deviations in Participant 2 are generally smaller in magnitude (many Zs ≈ |0.3–1.5| but with important positive buffers), and fewer of their elevated measures have very strong sample-level correlations with PSS compared with Participant 1.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1’s profile is more consistently and strongly aligned with markers that predict higher PSS in that study (higher anxiety with a very strong PSS correlation, extremely short/irregular sleep, nocturnal physiological arousal, pain), with only modest protective factors.  
- Participant 2 shows a mixed profile: some stress-linked signals but also substantial protective factors (adequate sleep duration, regular exercise) that likely attenuate perceived stress relative to their cohort mean.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",18,Pain,18,64232,NetHealth,27
17,67192,19,31,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe anxiety: GAD‑7 = 16.5 (Z = 1.25) and in this study GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.81). This is one of the strongest single predictors of higher PSS in Participant 1’s sample.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 16 (Z = 0.83), and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.51) in this sample, reinforcing the stress signal.
- Low self‑efficacy: NGSE below the mean (Z ≈ -0.62) and NGSE correlates strongly and negatively with PSS (r = -0.66), which supports higher perceived stress.
- Pain/interference: Moderate pain scores (PEG/PAPAS) that correlate positively with PSS (~0.44–0.48) add psychosocial burden consistent with higher stress.
- Elevated baseline physiological arousal: Resting HR and mesor elevated (Z ≈ 1.5), consistent with sustained arousal that maps onto stress.
- Behavioral sleep indicators: Very short median wearable-recorded sleep and late, variable sleep timing (even allowing for device limitations) align with the subjective sleep disturbance and stress.
- Lack of strong behavioral buffers: Fewer clear protective behavioral factors (limited social/support markers described), so fewer mitigating influences on PSS in the participant’s population frame.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- High depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms: CES‑D = 32 (Z = 1.95) and STAI = 58 (Z = 1.65). Both are notable elevations and in this study they correlate positively with PSS (CES‑D r ≈ 0.27; STAI r ≈ 0.31), supporting above-mean perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: PSQI = 7 (disturbed), late sleep start and increased night-to-night variability (Z ≈ 0.59) which modestly relate to higher PSS in this sample.
- Elevated evening and baseline cardiac tone: Mesor and resting HR elevated (mesor Z = 2.01; resting HR Z = 1.62) and sizable evening HR deviations (e.g., +16.3 bpm at 10–11 pm; Z ≈ 1.55) that, together with mood symptoms, are consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Additional distress indicators: Very low health satisfaction (Z ≈ -2.03) and low BMI (possible vulnerability) that add to overall distress context.

Comparative considerations within each study frame
- Strength of predictive links: For Participant 1, the top self-report predictors of PSS in that study (notably GAD‑7 and NGSE) are both strongly present and have large correlations with PSS (GAD r = 0.81; NGSE r = -0.66). For Participant 2, although depression and trait anxiety are elevated in absolute z‑terms (larger z-scores), their correlations with PSS in that sample are more modest (r ≈ 0.27–0.31). Thus Participant 1’s high-scoring measures are, in this dataset, more tightly tied to PSS.
- Convergence vs. mitigation: Participant 1 shows converging stress signals across highly PSS-related self-reports (severe anxiety, poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy), physiological arousal, and pain, with fewer strong buffering factors reported. Participant 2 shows strong internalizing symptoms and elevated cardiac tone but also several clear protective/mitigating patterns (adequate objective sleep duration, high interdaily stability and autocorrelation, substantial social time) that meaningfully counterbalance the distress signals in that participant’s sample.
- Magnitude and coherence: Although Participant 2 has some large z-scores (CES‑D, mesor, social time), the combination of measures most tightly coupled to PSS appears stronger and more coherent for Participant 1 (especially the very strong GAD‑7→PSS link plus corroborating poor subjective sleep and physiological arousal).

Weighing the evidence
- Participant 1: Multiple high‑weight indicators that are strongly correlated with PSS in that sample (severe anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, low self‑efficacy, pain, elevated resting HR) produce a coherent, convergent signal of perceived stress substantially above the study mean.
- Participant 2: Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and elevated evening/baseline HR argue for above-mean PSS, but several protective/mitigating features (adequate objective sleep, strong circadian regularity, high social time) and generally weaker PSS correlations for some elevated measures reduce the net likelihood that Participant 2’s PSS is as high as Participant 1’s.

  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ +1.2).
  - Reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ −1.05), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.07), low interdaily stability — pattern consistent with blunted/fragmented circadian rhythm associated with stress.
  - Pronounced early‑morning HR elevations (hours ~1–8 AM, several Z > 1) that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).
- Objective sleep behavior consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and stress: extremely short median nightly sleep (1h39m; Z ≈ −1.27), very late sleep start (~04:36 AM), naps present — convergent with the disturbed PSQI.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean = 21.59)
- Elevated trait/symptom measures known to associate with PSS:
  - CES-D = 21 (Z ≈ 0.8; “Depressed”), STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86; “anxious”); both correlate positively with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
  - Low self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29), which negatively correlates with PSS (r ≈ −0.15).
  - Subjective sleep marginally disturbed (PSQI = 6).
- Wearable/circadian signals consistent with higher stress:
  - High intradaily variability (0.70; Z ≈ +1.09) and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53) — both consistent with circadian fragmentation that relates to higher PSS (though correlations are modest, e.g., r ≈ 0.15).
  - Some sleep timing variability and slightly short median sleep (6 h 46 min; Z ≈ −0.52).
- Important protective/mitigating factors that offset risk:
  - Frequent exercise (Z ≈ +1.07–1.58), no substance use, low resting HR (54.6 bpm; Z ≈ −0.42), and above-average self‑reported happiness (Z ≈ +0.55) — all associated with lower PSS or greater resilience.
- Overall, symptom scores and circadian fragmentation point above-mean PSS, but effect sizes/correlations are smaller and several robust protective behaviors are present.

Comparative within-population reasoning and weighing of evidence
- Strength and relevance of predictors:
  - Participant 1 shows multiple indicators that both deviate notably from their sample mean and have very strong sample correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, self-efficacy r = −0.65, PSQI r = 0.49). Those high-correlation measures are meaningfully elevated and converge on one interpretation: higher perceived stress relative to their cohort.
  - Participant 2 also shows elevated symptom measures (CES-D, STAI) and circadian fragmentation, but the sample correlations for these measures with PSS are more modest (r ≈ 0.28–0.31 for symptom scores; even smaller for circadian metrics). Protective behaviors (regular exercise, no substance use, low resting HR, higher happiness) are stronger and likely mitigate perceived stress.
- Objective physiology and sleep:
  - Participant 1 has pronounced physiological signs of hyperarousal (elevated resting HR/MESOR, early‑morning HR elevations) and an extreme objective sleep profile (very short, late sleep) that align with high perceived stress — even allowing for the caveat that the very short wearable sleep could reflect recording artifacts, the pattern is concordant with subjective PSQI.
  - Participant 2’s objective physiology (low resting HR) and health behaviors point toward lower baseline physiological stress and greater resilience despite some circadian fragmentation.
- Net assessment:
  - Both participants are characterized as likely above their respective population means for PSS. However, Participant 1’s deviations occur on measures that have larger sample correlations with PSS and include marked physiological/circadian dysregulation and very disturbed sleep. Participant 2’s symptom elevations are moderate and partially counterbalanced by strong protective factors. Therefore the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

  - Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) and GAD-7 has the single largest positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r = 0.77).
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; disturbed sleep; PSQI r = 0.49).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 0.93; r = 0.67).
  - Lower general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62; r = -0.66).
- Additional burdens that tend to increase stress appraisal: pain interference (PEG-3 ~5.0) and some PAPAS score.
- Wearable/behavioral indicators consistent with higher arousal or disrupted restoration: elevated resting HR and MESOR (z ≈ 1.2–1.3), large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z ≈ 1.12), and late sleep start time—each of which is plausibly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Integrated summary in the description explicitly infers that this participant’s PSS is above the population mean (21.08) based primarily on the strong self-report correlates.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some self-report and objective signals that trend with higher PSS:
  - Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI z = 0.27) and mild depressive symptoms (CES‑D z = 0.18); both correlated positively with PSS (but correlations are small-to-moderate).
  - Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 6, just above typical cutpoint).
  - Circadian irregularity: lower interdaily stability (z = -0.74) and mild intradaily variability (z = 0.32).
  - Early-morning heart-rate deviations that show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample.
  - Slightly lower recent happiness and health satisfaction.
- Important mitigators in this participant reduce the likelihood of markedly higher PSS:
  - Strong protective psychosocial/behavioral signals (high self‑esteem z = 1.38, frequent exercise z > 1.0, high trust, low substance use).
  - Healthy physiology and sleep quantity (low resting HR, median sleep duration >7.5 h).
  - The summary explicitly concludes the participant is likely near the study mean PSS (21.6), possibly slightly above, rather than clearly above it.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both descriptions are relative to their own study populations. Participant 1 is inferred to be above their population mean (21.08) based on several high-correlation self-report predictors (GAD-7, PSQI, BASIS-24, NGSE) that have large sample-level effect sizes with PSS. Those predictors are strong and consistent.
- Participant 2 shows only modest elevations on anxiety/depression and sleep complaints; these risk signals have smaller correlations with PSS in that dataset and are substantially offset by strong protective factors (notably high self‑esteem and frequent exercise) and healthy physiology. The provided inference for Participant 2 is “near the mean, possibly slightly above,” not clearly above.
- The magnitude and coherence of indicators favoring higher perceived stress are substantially greater in Participant 1 (several variables with strong correlations and moderate-to-high z-scores) than in Participant 2 (mostly small z-scores and small correlations, with countervailing protective signals).

Weighting of evidence and conclusion
- Overall balance: Participant 1 has multiple, relatively large self-report and some wearable signals that align with higher PSS and strong sample-level correlations; Participant 2’s risk signals are milder and partially or largely offset by robust protective factors.
- Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse (higher) overall perceived stress relative to their population.

- No substance problems (BASIS‑24 substance z = -1.62).
- Long median sleep duration (z = 1.19) and normative resting HR; emotional lability lower than mean. These factors make the inference “slightly above” rather than strongly elevated.

- Participant 1: multiple risk signals (anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, pain, circadian irregularity) but several strong protective factors (high self‑efficacy with a large negative correlation with PSS, absence of substance problems, long median sleep). Critically, the GAD‑7 correlation with PSS in this sample is very large, but the GAD score itself is only in the mild range; the overall profile led to a conservative “slightly above mean” inference.
- Participant 2: very large deviations on key affective/sleep measures (CES‑D z = 2.05; PSQI z = 3.83) that are directly and clearly tied to perceived stress, plus wearable signals of physiological/circadian fragmentation. Protective behaviors are present but appear secondary relative to the severity of depressive symptoms and extreme subjective sleep problems. The profile is described as “moderately elevated” above the study mean.
- Relative magnitude: Participant 2 shows larger standardized deviations on the most salient risk variables (notably PSQI and CES‑D) and a more convergent set of psychological + physiological risk signals. Participant 1 shows a mix of risk and strong protective factors, and the narrative and evidence point to only a modest elevation above the mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2’s combination of very high depressive symptoms and very severe subjective sleep disturbance, corroborated by physiological fragments, provides stronger and more convergent evidence of higher perceived stress than Participant 1’s profile, which is more mixed and buffered by strong protective factors (notably self‑efficacy and no substance problems).
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to have the higher PSS (i.e., worse overall perceived stress) relative to their respective study population.

20,74899,21,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52; Z = +1.06) — one of the stronger positive correlates with PSS in that dataset (r = 0.31).  
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17; Z = +0.38), which positively correlate with PSS (r = 0.28).  
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; Z = +1.05) and objectively late/short sleep (median 5 h 58 min; start ~02:25 AM), which clinically align with stress and with other elevated symptom measures in this participant.  
- Circadian fragmentation (elevated intradaily variability Z = +0.46; reduced 24-h autocorrelation Z = −0.19) and evening physiological activation (large positive HR deviation 5–6 pm, Z = +1.69) — these features are associated with higher PSS in this cohort (though correlations are modest).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Strongly elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) where the instrument’s correlation with PSS is very large in this sample (r = 0.77).  
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) with a substantial sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.49).  
- High pain burden and interference (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (~0.45–0.49).  
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 emotional lability = 9) with a large correlation to PSS (r = 0.66).  
- Wearable indicators consistent with stress-related dysregulation: very short median recorded sleep (3 h 55 min), blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −1.51) and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.75) — these wearable measures modestly associate with higher PSS in the cohort.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participant summaries conclude an inferred PSS above their respective population means (P1 mean 21.59; P2 mean 21.04). The critical comparison is the strength and number of indicators that reliably predict higher PSS within each participant’s cohort.  
- Participant 2’s elevated measures (GAD-7, PSQI, pain, emotional lability) are each associated with relatively large correlations with PSS in that study (r values ~0.45 up to 0.77). Multiple strong predictors are elevated concurrently, and objective sleep is extremely short. Although Participant 2 also has notable protective factors (high self-efficacy, low interpersonal problems, low resting HR), the strongest predictors of PSS in that cohort are substantially elevated and point toward meaningful perceived stress.  
- Participant 1 shows several risk indicators (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed subjective sleep, circadian fragmentation, evening HR activation), but the sample-level correlations tying many of these measures to PSS are smaller (e.g., STAI r = 0.31, CES-D r = 0.28, intradaily variability r = 0.16, resting HR r = 0.13). Participant 1 also has several relatively strong protective factors (frequent exercise, good self-rated physical health Z = +1.30, high interpersonal trust Z = +1.79) that moderate the net inference.  
- Severity comparison on key measures: Participant 2’s subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI 13.5) is worse than Participant 1’s PSQI 9; Participant 2’s sleep duration is markedly shorter (≈3 h 55 min vs ≈5 h 58 min); anxiety symptoms in Participant 2 are tied to a much stronger PSS correlation in that cohort (r = 0.77) than Participant 1’s trait anxiety correlation (r = 0.31). Overall, Participant 2’s elevated predictors are both stronger (in terms of sample correlations) and more severe.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- While both participants are inferred above their population means, Participant 2 has multiple high-impact self-report indicators (anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, emotional lability) that, in this cohort, have large correlations with PSS and are highly predictive of higher perceived stress. Participant 1’s elevated signals are meaningful but generally linked to weaker PSS correlations and are partly offset by several protective behavioral and self-rated health factors.

- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 12), a variable strongly correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.50).
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability z = 0.53) with a strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.65).
- Wearable-derived nocturnal heart-rate elevations (1–4 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.41).
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (resting HR z = 1.37; mesor z = 1.18), consistent with higher baseline cardiovascular tone.
- Very long median sleep duration and large night-to-night variability (sleep duration z ≈ 2.26; SD z ≈ 2.38), indicating unstable sleep behavior that can accompany stress-related dysregulation.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in their profile)
- Very high sedentary/screen-time behaviors (video games z = 4.74; TV/videos z = 3.17; internet use z = 2.19) which can be associated with poorer coping and greater stress risk.
- Low social-trust score (z = -2.39), a potential interpersonal risk factor for perceived stress.
- Later median sleep start time (~01:04 AM) and very low exercise frequency (strongly negative z), both of which can pose risk for stress.
- Modestly elevated heart-rate mesor and amplitude (mesor z ≈ 1.35; amplitude z ≈ 1.72) and slightly above-average resting HR (z ≈ 0.51), which could reflect greater tonic arousal linked weakly to PSS.

Comparative, population-relative reasoning
- Participant 1 is characterized as near their study population mean PSS (population mean = 20.96) with several domain-specific signals that tend to raise PSS (strongest: PSQI, emotional lability, nocturnal HR).
- Participant 2 is characterized as below their study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.64) with multiple very strong protective signals (notably CES-D = 0, STAI-Trait z ≈ -2.11, high self-esteem, high happiness, excellent circadian regularity with interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation z > 2). The risk signals for Participant 2 (sedentary behavior, late sleep timing, modestly elevated HR) are present but generally smaller in magnitude relative to their strong protective indicators.
- Because each description is relative to its own population mean, the correct frame is within-sample position. In that frame, P1 is at/near average (with meaningful stress-linked features), while P2 is below average with strong low-stress indicators.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Overall, Participant 1 shows more and stronger domain-specific indicators that align with higher perceived stress (especially sleep disturbance, emotional lability, and nocturnal HR elevations) and is at or near the sample mean.
- Participant 2 shows predominantly strong protective signals indicating lower-than-average perceived stress in their study sample, despite a few behavioral risk factors.

17,89652,19,28,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Objectively irregular sleep/circadian markers: very late median sleep start (02:54), modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m, z = -0.76), high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 172 min, z = 1.62).  
- Fragmented daily physiology: elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (0.73, z = 1.30) and relatively low 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.22, z = -0.87), suggesting inconsistent daily structure.  
- Slightly increased daytime napping (mean naps z = 1.49).  
- These wearable/circadian features have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15; sleep variability r ≈ 0.13), so they provide modest evidence toward higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Strong, high-weight self-report indicators: severe anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5, z = 1.25) and very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 16, z = 0.83). Both measures have strong positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD‑7 r = 0.81; PSQI r = 0.51).  
- Reduced psychological resources: low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62) which is strongly inversely correlated with PSS (r = -0.66).  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG/PAPAS) that correlate positively with PSS (~0.44–0.48).  
- Physiological arousal: elevated resting heart rate (79.8 bpm, z = 1.53) and elevated mesor (z = 1.49), consistent with sustained arousal linked to stress.  
- Wearable sleep summary showing extremely short median sleep (2 h 31 m, z = -0.97), late sleep start (~01:37) and high sleep-start variability (SD 254 min, z = 0.98), which align with the subjective sleep disturbance.  
- Additional functional/emotional indicators: some emotional lability and interpersonal/substance-related elevations on BASIS‑24 subscales.

Comparative weighing (within-study-frame reasoning)
- Strength and convergence of indicators: Participant 2 shows multiple strong, converging high-weight signals that are empirically well-correlated with PSS in that study (severe anxiety, very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy, elevated resting HR). These indicators are both sizable in z-score and supported by high correlations with PSS, making them powerful predictors of above-mean perceived stress in Participant 2’s cohort.  
- Participant 1’s strongest signals for higher stress are limited to wearable-derived circadian/sleep irregularities, but subjective mental-health and wellbeing measures are clearly favorable (low depression/anxiety, high happiness and self‑esteem, good PSQI) and have stronger predictive weight in that study. The circadian metrics that suggest risk have only modest correlations with PSS in that sample.  
- Measurement caveats: Participant 2’s wearable median sleep estimate may be biased low, but the subjective PSQI and severe anxiety corroborate substantial sleep disturbance and distress. Participant 1’s objective irregularities could indicate vulnerability but are not supported by subjective distress measures.

Conclusion
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is much more likely to be above their study population mean PSS, whereas Participant 1 is likely at or below their study population mean PSS.

- Severe self-reported anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = +1.25). In this study GAD‑7 is strongly positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.81), making this a very high-weight indicator of elevated perceived stress.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83), another moderately strong correlate of PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.51).
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), a substantial inverse correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.66).
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS moderate; correlations with PSS ≈ 0.44–0.48), adding psychosocial strain.
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular arousal (resting HR Z ≈ +1.53; mesor Z ≈ +1.49), consistent with sustained physiological stress.
- Behavioral sleep signatures (very short median wearable sleep 2h31, late and variable sleep timing) that align with the subjective report of disturbed sleep and with increased stress.
- Some emotional/functional disturbance (BASIS‑24 elevations) that map onto higher stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence in the description)
- Objective circadian disruption: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These features are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample (correlations generally small, e.g., |r| ≈ 0.1–0.2).
- Shorter and somewhat more variable sleep (median ≈ 6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33; duration variability Z ≈ +0.94), which have small positive correlations with PSS in this dataset.
- High sedentary/leisure time (e.g., TV Z ≈ +2.54) that is weakly associated with greater PSS.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (large positive Zs at 5–7 AM), an atypical physiological pattern that could reflect early awakenings/activity or an artifact and might relate to stress in some contexts.

Comparative weighting within each study frame
- Participant 1’s highest-weight indicators are strongly predictive of PSS in that sample: severe trait/state anxiety (very high r), markedly poor PSQI (moderate r), and low self‑efficacy (substantial inverse r). Multiple modalities (self-report + physiological) converge on above-mean stress. Although there are a few protective circadian features, they are lower-weight relative to the strong self-report and HR signals.
- Participant 2’s strongest signals are the favorable self-report measures (low trait anxiety, high happiness/self‑esteem, high health satisfaction) that are directly and moderately predictive of lower PSS in that sample. The features pointing toward higher PSS are primarily objective circadian/activity markers whose correlations with PSS are smaller in magnitude; some objective anomalies may reflect behavior (e.g., early exercise) or artifacts rather than stress per se.

Conclusion (which participant likely has higher perceived stress)
Given the relative strengths of indicators (P1: multiple high-weight, converging predictors of elevated PSS; P2: low-weight objective signs of circadian disruption but strong self-report indicators of lower stress), Participant 1 is much more likely to exhibit the higher PSS relative to their respective study population.

Several of these measures have strong correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Extreme sleep/circadian disruption corroborating subjective distress: median nightly sleep ~2 h 58 m (z ≈ −0.82) with very late sleep onset (~02:23), high intradaily variability (z = +1.3), low interdaily stability/autocorrelation (z ≈ −1.4), and reduced amplitude (z ≈ −1.4). These objective features are classically associated with higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: marked positive nocturnal heart-rate deviations (e.g., 1–2am z = +1.18) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.36–0.40), supporting elevated nocturnal arousal linked to perceived stress.
- Multiple indicators are ≥ ~1 SD from the sample mean in stress-related directions, suggesting an above-mean PSS that is fairly sizable (population mean 20.92, SD reported ≈7.51).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Some elevated stress-linked signals: clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9, z ≈ +1.05), elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T = 44, z ≈ +0.27), late/variable sleep (median ~6 h 51 m, sleep start ~00:59, sleep SD ≈ 89 min), and modestly elevated resting HR/mesor (resting HR z ≈ +0.79; mesor z ≈ +0.74).
- High evening internet use (z ≈ +2.19) could contribute to late sleep and stress.
- Holistic assessment in the description concludes perceived stress above the study mean (population mean 21.64), but the elevation is characterized as modest-to-moderate rather than extreme.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as having PSS above their respective population means (P1 above mean 20.92; P2 above mean 21.64). The two population means are similar, so direct comparison is reasonable in terms of relative deviation magnitudes and the severity of correlates.
- Participant 1 shows multiple, large deviations on measures that are strongly correlated with PSS (severe anxiety, emotional lability, pain, very short/late sleep, nocturnal HR elevations, and low self-efficacy). Several of these are ≳ +1 SD from the sample mean (or very strongly deviant for sleep duration), indicating a substantial elevation relative to their sample.
- Participant 2 shows some above-mean indicators (notably PSQI and high evening internet use), but many stress-related signals are more modest (many z’s < 1) and several protective/offsetting factors are present (low depressive symptoms, high interdaily stability/autocorrelation, preserved rhythm, maintained academics). The overall elevation in PSS is described as modest.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1’s profile is more extreme and more consistently aligned with high-PSS correlates (clinical-level anxiety, near-total sleep loss nightly, nocturnal physiological arousal, low coping/self-efficacy).
- Participant 2’s profile is mixed: some stress-related signs but with substantial protective factors and generally smaller effect sizes on PSS-related measures.

- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.43) with moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (≈ 0.5).
- Modestly reduced circadian robustness (reduced amplitude/autocorrelation) that trends with higher PSS.
- Counterpoints: strong protective self-report signals — low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ -0.85, and GAD-7 has a very strong sample correlation with PSS, r ≈ 0.77), high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86; r ≈ -0.64), low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97; r ≈ +0.65) — these are substantial negative predictors of PSS. Resting HR and several rhythm metrics are near average.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both profiles are interpreted as “above the population mean” in their respective samples. The question is which participant’s profile indicates a relatively higher PSS given the strength, number, and predictive value of their elevated features.
- Participant 1’s above-mean signals are primarily sleep-timing/circadian instability (some large Zs: interdaily stability ≈ -1.98, naps ≈ +3.05) and mild trait anxiety. However, many of these circadian/sleep-timing metrics have only modest sample correlations with PSS (r values mostly in the ≈0.1–0.3 range). Protective physiological signals (low resting HR, low substance use) also temper the stress inference.
- Participant 2 shows multiple, large-magnitude risk signals that have stronger sample-level associations with PSS: very severe objective sleep restriction (3.5 h), very poor PSQI (11.5), elevated pain (PEG-3 Z ≈ +1.33), and nocturnal HR elevations — each of these features is moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSS in that study. Although Participant 2 also has strong protective psychological signals (low GAD-7, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability), the risk signals are numerous and highly PSS‑relevant (particularly the extreme sleep restriction and pain).
- Critically, the predictive strength (sample correlations) of Participant 2’s primary risk features (sleep quality/duration, pain, nocturnal HR) is larger than the predictive strength of Participant 1’s principal risk features (timing variability, interdaily stability, naps). Participant 1’s largest Z-scores are in metrics that weakly predict higher PSS in the sample, whereas Participant 2’s large abnormalities occur in metrics that more strongly predict PSS.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2’s combination of extreme objective sleep loss, very poor subjective sleep, elevated pain, and nocturnal physiological arousal — all of which have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that study — is more likely to correspond to a higher perceived stress level relative to their cohort mean than Participant 1’s profile is relative to theirs. Participant 1 shows meaningful circadian/sleep timing disruption, but those features have weaker links to PSS in the sample and are partially offset by physiological and behavioral protective factors.

- Wearable sleep metrics consistent with sleep problems: median recorded sleep very short (1 h 44 m, z ≈ -1.24) and highly variable sleep timing—these align with the PSQI and support increased perceived stress.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 (z ≈ 0.71) and PAPAS (z ≈ 0.8) are elevated and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), which would push inferred PSS upward.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations consistent with arousal: modest night-hour HR deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated depressive symptoms: CES‑D = 28 (z = 1.53); although CES‑D → PSS correlation is moderate (r ≈ 0.29), the magnitude of this elevation is large and a strong indicator of higher perceived stress.
- Elevated trait anxiety: STAI = 47 (z ≈ 0.56), with a positive correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 8 (z ≈ 0.59), which is associated with higher PSS.
- Low current happiness and somewhat lower self‑esteem (momentary happiness z = -1.61; RSES z ≈ -0.31), contributing additional self-report signal for increased perceived stress.
- Multiple convergent self-report indicators (depression, trait anxiety, subjective sleep, low happiness) pointing together toward above-mean PSS despite objective protective signals.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s risk signals (PSQI, pain) are meaningful and correlate moderately-to-strongly with PSS, but they are counterbalanced by strong protective indicators: very low GAD-7 (z ≈ -1.2) and high self‑efficacy (NGSE; inverse r ≈ -0.68), plus robust circadian and cardiac markers (low intradaily variability, high amplitude, low resting HR). Notably, GAD-7 has a very large positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.75), so Participant 1’s low anxiety is a powerful downward force on inferred PSS. The integrated interpretation given for Participant 1 is “near the population mean, with a modest uplift from sleep and pain,” i.e., roughly at or only slightly above 21.5.
- Participant 2 presents multiple elevated self-report measures that all point in the same direction (depression markedly high, trait anxiety elevated, subjective sleep disturbed, low happiness). Although wearable markers (long, regular sleep; high interdaily stability; high amplitude) are protective, the report explicitly notes that the self-report elevations have larger clinical magnitude and thus outweigh the objective protective signals. The integrated interpretation given is that Participant 2’s perceived stress is above their study mean (21.62).
- Comparing the two within their respective samples: Participant 1 is characterized as approximately at/near the mean with only a modest upward push from sleep and pain, while Participant 2 is characterized as above the mean driven by pronounced self-report affective symptom burden (notably a high CES‑D). Also, Participant 1’s very low anxiety score (a strong inverse indicator) likely produces a larger downward adjustment than any single elevated indicator produces upward; Participant 2 lacks such a strong protective self-report signal.

Overall balance of evidence and decision
- The net evidence indicates Participant 2 has the worse overall perceived stress. Participant 2 has multiple, convergent self-report elevations (especially a substantially elevated CES‑D) that the summary states outweigh objective protective markers, and the profile is explicitly labeled “above the population mean.” Participant 1, by contrast, is judged near the mean with only modest upward influences and strong protective factors (particularly very low generalized anxiety and higher self‑efficacy).

- Objective sleep pathology is extreme: median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 m with very high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min); PSQI = 18 (Z ≈ +1.49). Severe sleep restriction and fragmentation are strong stress amplifiers.  
- Wearable physiology consistent with stress: circadian fragmentation (low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability), nocturnal heart-rate elevations around sleep onset that have moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51).  
- Although there are protective signals (low substance-use problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR possibly reflecting fitness), the number, magnitude, and high PSS-correlations of the risk signals outweigh them.

- Blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude z ≈ -1.48; interdaily stability z ≈ -1.40), and pronounced evening HR deviations (8–9 pm mean deviation z ≈ +1.85) —consistent with elevated evening arousal that can map onto perceived stress.  
- Some behavioral signals (reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use) align with higher stress.  
- Protective/mitigating signals include normal resting HR and adequate average sleep duration (~7 h), healthy BMI, preserved academic function, and modest substance use.

Comparative, within-sample-frame reasoning
- Both participant profiles are interpreted as above their respective study means. However, Participant 1’s elevations are more extreme in magnitude and in measures that have strong sample-level correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r ≈ 0.71 and very poor objective sleep). Participant 1 has multiple Z-scores around or above ±2.0 across anxiety, emotional lability, pain, and self-efficacy—suggesting stronger and more convergent drivers of high perceived stress.  
- Participant 2 shows meaningful elevations (depression, some circadian blunting, evening HR spikes, high nap rate) but generally smaller Z-scores on psychological measures and several buffering features (adequate mean sleep duration, normal resting HR, intact functioning). The correlations between Participant 2’s main symptom measures and PSS are more modest in this sample than the key correlations observed for Participant 1.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 1 exhibits more severe, convergent, and strongly PSS-linked indicators (severe anxiety, extreme objective sleep restriction, high emotional lability and pain, low self-efficacy). Participant 2 has above-mean stress risk but less extreme and less PSS-correlated signal overall.

- Very poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 13 (Z ≈ +2.9), which commonly amplifies perceived stress and co-occurs with mood symptoms.
- Elevated resting heart rate: RHR ≈ 68.6 bpm (Z ≈ +1.24), and blunted nocturnal HR suppression—objective autonomic signs consistent with higher arousal and higher PSS.
- Behavioral/social risk factors: marked social withdrawal (in‑person socializing Z ≈ -2.20) and extreme sedentary/ screen leisure (large positive Zs), which are associated with rumination and reduced social buffering of stress.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Each description is anchored to its own sample mean. Participant 1 is characterized as likely below her study’s mean PSS (21.5), driven by very large protective signals (NGSE Z ≈ +1.79; GAD Z ≈ -1.38; RHR Z ≈ -2.23; strong interdaily stability and amplitude). The single substantive countervailing signal is moderate PSQI elevation (disturbed sleep), and nocturnal HR correlations are small.
- Participant 2 is explicitly characterized as above his study’s mean PSS (21.61), with multiple, large convergent risk signals: very high CES‑D (Z ≈ +2.99), very high PSQI (Z ≈ +2.9), elevated STAI (Z ≈ +1.75), elevated RHR (Z ≈ +1.24), and behavioral indicators of social withdrawal and high sedentary leisure (Zs strongly deviated). Protective signals (adequate objective sleep duration, exercise) are present but smaller in magnitude and do not offset the large affective and subjective symptom elevations.
- Magnitude of deviations matters: Participant 2’s risk indicators (CES‑D and PSQI Zs ≈ +3) are larger and more directly linked to PSS than Participant 1’s counterindicators (PSQI moderate, nocturnal HR small correlations). Participant 1’s strongest deviations point toward lower stress (especially very low RHR and high self‑efficacy), whereas Participant 2’s strongest deviations point toward higher stress.

Balance of evidence and conclusion
- Overall evidence is stronger that Participant 2 exhibits higher perceived stress than Participant 1 when each is considered relative to their respective study populations and given the magnitudes and convergence of measures.

23,64232,17,27,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean):
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; z = 0.27) and above-cutoff subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI z = 0.59), both of which are reported to correlate positively with PSS in this dataset.
- Markedly low interdaily stability (z = −1.56) and large sleep-start variability (z = 1.48), behavioral circadian irregularity patterns that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress.
- Lower momentary happiness (z = −0.53) and modestly elevated MESOR/late-day heart-rate deviations (MESOR z = 0.46 and positive evening/night HR deviations) that support elevated arousal or disrupted recovery.
- Integrated assessment in the description explicitly infers a likely above-mean PSS (mild-to-moderate elevation), despite some protective factors.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean):
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 10.5) and very short objective sleep (median ≈ 4 h 21 min) — severe sleep restriction is a strong stressor.
- Elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (+12 to +15 bpm; z > 1) that are associated with nocturnal arousal; the 1–2 AM deviation has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.46) in this sample.
- Large sleep-timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 123 min) consistent with irregular sleep that can increase perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighing of evidence:
- Both participants show mixed profiles, but the descriptive summaries explicitly infer Participant 1 is likely above their study mean and Participant 2 is likely below theirs.
- Strength and relevance of predictors differ: For Participant 2, trait measures that are strongly correlated with PSS (very low GAD-7, z ≈ −1.29, and relatively high self-efficacy, NGSE z = 0.30) are robust protective signals — and the description emphasizes these measures have large sample correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.77, NGSE r = −0.65). In contrast, Participant 2’s sleep-related risks have more moderate sample correlations with PSS.
- For Participant 1, several risk signals (subjective sleep disturbance, anxiety, and especially strong circadian irregularity: interdaily stability z = −1.56 and sleep-timing variability z = 1.48) point toward elevated stress; protective signals (long sleep duration, frequent sports) are present but described as tempering rather than overturning the risk profile.
- Comparing the net evidence: Participant 2’s most severe-seeming problem is extremely short objective sleep and nocturnal HR elevation, but these are counterbalanced by very strong, high-correlation protective trait measures and very high circadian regularity (interdaily stability z = 1.98). Participant 1’s risk signals are more numerous and coherently aligned with higher PSS (anxiety + subjective sleep disturbance + marked circadian irregularity + lower momentary happiness), and the integrated judgment in the summary explicitly places Participant 1 above their population mean (mild-to-moderate elevation).

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_1""}",64232,NetHealth,27,23,Pain,17
15,71193,15,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 39; z = 2.67). CES‑D correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28), and this is one of the largest magnitude signals in the profile.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI‑T z = 1.85), another construct that correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Low positive affect and self‑esteem (happy z = -1.61; RSES z = -1.43), which have modest negative correlations with PSS (r ≈ -0.19 and -0.15).
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) despite adequate objective duration, which often accompanies and amplifies perceived stress.
- Low socializing and infrequent exercise (reduced behavioral buffers), and engagement in sedentary hobbies (video games z = 2.47) that may reduce stress resilience.
- Low self‑rated health satisfaction and low trust—additional psychosocial strain indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15.5; z ≈ 0.67) and pain/functional interference (PAPAS z ≈ 0.93). Both PSQI and PAPAS correlate strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower general self‑efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62). NGSE correlates strongly and negatively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.69), so this is a potent stress‑related signal.
- Elevated nocturnal heart‑rate deviations (night HR z up to ≈ 1.38) and higher mesor/RHR (mesor z ≈ 0.7; RHR z ≈ 0.61); nocturnal HR elevations correlate with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47).
- Reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.83), suggesting less regular daily timing (small association with higher PSS).

Countervailing/protective signals for each (brief)
- Participant 1: objective circadian stability and longer-than-average sleep duration (sleep z ≈ 1.05; circadian metrics z positive) are protective, but they do not fully offset the strong psychological symptom burden.
- Participant 2: relatively low GAD‑7 (z ≈ -0.76; anxiety strongly correlated with PSS r ≈ 0.76), long median nightly sleep (z ≈ 0.92), and low intradaily variability (z ≈ -1.28) temper the risk and suggest a more moderate elevation.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both profiles are interpreted relative to their own study means and both are judged above their population PSS means. The key comparison is the magnitude and relevance of the strongest signals in each profile and the strength of their sample‑level correlations with PSS.
- Participant 1 exhibits very large deviations on core affective variables (CES‑D z = 2.67; STAI‑T z = 1.85; happiness/self‑esteem z ≈ ±1.4–1.6). These affective signals are directly and consistently associated with higher PSS in the sample and are among the most extreme z‑scores across both participants.
- Participant 2 shows several moderate-to-strong stress correlates (PSQI, PAPAS, NGSE, nocturnal HR elevations). Notably, NGSE has a strong sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), and PSQI/PAPAS correlate strongly (r ≈ 0.53). However, the absolute z‑scores for these markers are more modest (generally < 1.0, except PAPAS ≈ 0.93 and some HR nocturnal z up to ≈1.38).
- Weighing severity and breadth: Participant 1’s profile contains multiple large-magnitude psychological disturbances (especially depressive symptom burden) that are robustly linked to elevated perceived stress. Participant 2’s risk profile is multi‑faceted and meaningful (sleep, pain, low self‑efficacy, nocturnal physiology), but the individual indicators are overall less extreme in magnitude than Participant 1’s peak affective signals and are partially offset by low concurrent GAD‑7 and long objective sleep.

Conclusion
- Overall, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their study population.

21,11402,30,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 54; Z = 1.25). STAI–Trait is one of the strongest survey predictors in this sample (r ≈ 0.31) and is the primary driver toward above-mean PSS for this participant.  
- Modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 17; Z = 0.38), which are positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).  
- Late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:17; sleep-start SD Z ≈ 1.14). Sleep-timing irregularity in this cohort is positively associated with PSS (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.17).  
- Elevated basal cardiovascular tone signals (resting HR Z ≈ 0.62; MESOR Z ≈ 1.30), which have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14 and 0.06) and indicate some sustained autonomic activation.  
- Evening-biased physiological activation combined with late sleep onset (circadian misalignment), which literature and the study note link to increased perceived stress.

Protective/mitigating signals noted in the same relative frame: relatively good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ −0.8), high self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ 0.26), low intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ −1.45), and some social/leisure patterns that weakly protect. These moderate but do not eliminate the risk signals above.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Clinically meaningful anxiety (GAD‑7 = 12; Z ≈ 0.46) that is an extremely strong predictor of PSS in this sample (correlation ≈ 0.77). This is a high-impact signal for above-mean PSS.  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; Z ≈ 1.32) with a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.45). This is another strong, convergent predictor.  
- Pronounced nocturnal heart-rate elevations (hourly deviations with z up to ~1.02) that correlate positively with PSS (~0.22–0.39), indicating nocturnal autonomic arousal/poor recovery.  
- Emotional lability (BASIS‑24 subscale) that strongly correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.68) and reduced self-efficacy (NGSE low; corr ≈ −0.66), both of which point toward greater perceived stress susceptibility.  
- Additional risk-relevant behavior (substance‑abuse subscale Z ≈ 1.5), though that subscale reportedly has negligible correlation with PSS in this dataset.

Protective/mitigating signals for Participant 2 (relative to their population) include adequate objective sleep duration (median ≈ 7h19m; Z ≈ 0.66), lower resting HR (Z ≈ −0.64), preserved circadian amplitude/autocorrelation, and low pain scores. However, these mitigators have weaker direct ties to the strongest PSS predictors noted above.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Both participants are judged above their respective population PSS means, but the strength and convergence of high-impact predictors differ. Participant 1’s principal risk signals are elevated trait anxiety (moderate predictor, r ≈ 0.31), some depressive symptoms, late/irregular sleep timing, and modestly raised basal HR/MESOR; several relatively strong protective signals (good PSQI, low IV, high self‑esteem) partially offset risk. Overall the risk predictors for P1 have moderate correlations with PSS in that study and a mixed pattern.  
- Participant 2 presents multiple high-impact, convergent signals that are tightly linked to PSS in that study: GAD‑7 has a very large correlation with PSS (≈0.77), PSQI is highly elevated (Z ≈ 1.32) and moderately correlated with PSS, nocturnal HR elevations and emotional‑lability scores also show substantial correlations with PSS. Although P2 has some physiological/behavioral protective signs (good objective sleep duration, lower resting HR), the strongest and most directly predictive measures for perceived stress are more numerous and have larger effect-size associations than for P1.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 shows stronger, more directly PSS‑linked signals (especially anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) with high correlations to PSS in their sample and convergent nocturnal physiology and emotion‑regulation measures. Participant 1 shows meaningful risk indicators (notably trait anxiety and circadian misalignment) but those predictors have smaller correlations with PSS in that study and are more offset by protective signals.  
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their population mean) than Participant 1.

25,74899,21,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 1’s study population mean = 21.04)
- Elevated anxiety (GAD‑7 = 6, and in this dataset GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS, r = 0.78).  
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13; PSQI correlates moderately with PSS, r = 0.49).  
- Pain-related interference (PEG‑3 mean = 6.78; PEG r = 0.44) and moderate activity/pain interference (PAPAS z ≈ 0.24).  
- Objective circadian/sleep irregularity: low interdaily stability (z = -0.68), low 24‑h autocorr (z = -0.35), and very high night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD z = +1.7) — patterns linked to higher PSS.  
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS‑24 interpersonal subscale z = +0.54).  

Protective/offsetting factors for Participant 1 (reduce inferred PSS): relatively high self‑efficacy (NGSE z = +0.3; strong negative correlate r = -0.65), no substance problems (BASIS‑24 substance z = -1.62), low emotional lability, normal resting HR, and long median sleep duration (z = +1.19) despite poor quality.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean = 21.59)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52, z = +1.06) — a primary contributor to higher inferred PSS in this profile.  
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 17, z = +0.38) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, z = +1.05).  
- Objective short and late sleep (median sleep 5 h 58 min, z = -1.52; median sleep start ~02:25 AM) — clinically meaningful signs of reduced restorative opportunity.  
- Circadian fragmentation and variability consistent with higher stress: intradaily variability z = +0.46 and reduced 24‑h autocorrelation (z = -0.19).  
- Physiological activation signals: elevated mesor (z ≈ +0.95), somewhat higher resting HR (z = +0.47), and pronounced evening HR deviation (5–6 pm z ≈ +1.69) supporting higher arousal/reduced recovery.

Protective/offsetting factors for Participant 2 (reduce inferred PSS): frequent exercise (z = +1.07), good self‑rated physical health (z = +1.30), high interpersonal trust (z = +1.79), moderate social contact, and low substance use.

Comparative, within‑study-frame reasoning
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the magnitude and quality of the signals differ. Participant 1 is judged “slightly above” the population mean with several strong predictors clustered (notably GAD‑7 with a very large sample correlation to PSS and extremely high sleep variability). However, Participant 1 also has several strong protective factors (notably high self‑efficacy with a large negative correlation with PSS and absence of substance problems), and the profile is explicitly characterized as modestly above the mean.  
- Participant 2 shows multiple moderate-to-strong adverse signals (trait anxiety z > +1, PSQI z > +1, short sleep z ≈ -1.5, circadian fragmentation, elevated evening HR z ≈ +1.7) and fewer strong countervailing factors; the summary explicitly concludes the participant’s profile is consistent with PSS above the study mean. Although some protective behaviors (exercise, health satisfaction, trust) are present, they are described as insufficient to outweigh the pattern of elevated anxiety/mood symptoms, disturbed sleep, and physiological/circadian irregularity.  
- Relative effect-size considerations: Participant 1’s single strongest statistical link to PSS is the GAD‑7 (r = 0.78), but their GAD‑7 score is only in the mild range and multiple robust protective signals are present. Participant 2’s adverse signals are more numerous and include several z-scores ≥ ~1 (trait anxiety, PSQI, evening HR) plus objectively short/delayed sleep, suggesting a larger net elevation above that population mean than Participant 1’s modest elevation above theirs.

Weighting the balance of evidence
- Both are above their population means, but Participant 2’s profile shows a clearer, broader, and numerically larger set of stress‑related deviations (anxiety, mood, disturbed subjective sleep, objectively short/delayed sleep, circadian fragmentation, and physiological arousal) with fewer strong protective offsets. Participant 1’s elevated indicators are somewhat counterbalanced by high self‑efficacy and absence of substance problems, and the profile is explicitly characterized as only modestly above the mean.

20,67192,21,31,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong, high-correlation psychological predictors elevated:
  - Elevated anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) — correlation with PSS = 0.77 (very large). This is a highly PSS-relevant signal in this sample.
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9) — correlation with PSS = 0.66 (large).
- Marked sleep disturbance:
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; corr ≈ 0.49).
  - Very short objectively-recorded sleep (median ≈ 3h55m).
  - Circadian blunting and irregularity (reduced amplitude Z ≈ −1.51; low interdaily stability), which modestly associate with higher PSS.
- Pain and functional interference:
  - High pain (PEG-3 = 7.89; PAPAS = 86) — correlations with PSS ≈ 0.45–0.49.
- Wearable physiology partly consistent with stress:
  - Flattened diurnal HR range and shifted rest-activity profile (modest associations with higher PSS).
- Protective signals (reduce inferred PSS but do not eliminate risk):
  - High general self-efficacy (NGSE = 38; Z = 1.41) with strong negative correlation to PSS (r = −0.68).
  - Low interpersonal problems and relatively low resting HR (physiological buffer).
- Overall: several very strong PSS predictors (especially GAD-7 and emotional lability) and extreme objective sleep shortness provide a coherent, high-risk profile relative to the Participant 1 population mean (21.04).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated internalizing symptoms:
  - High depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; Z = 1.95) — correlation with PSS ≈ 0.27.
  - High trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z = 1.65) — correlation with PSS ≈ 0.31.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing irregularity:
  - PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep).
  - Late bedtimes with high night-to-night variability (sleep timing SD ≈ 110 min; sleep-duration variability SD ≈ 108 min), which modestly correlate with higher PSS.
- Elevated tonic/evening physiological arousal:
  - High mesor (Z = 2.01) and higher resting HR (71.8 bpm; Z = 1.62) and pronounced evening HR deviations — these support higher arousal, though their direct correlations with PSS in this sample are small to modest.
- Additional risk signals: low health satisfaction and underweight BMI (may co-occur with distress).
- Protective signals (substantial):
  - Adequate objective sleep duration (~7h16m) and low napping.
  - Strong circadian regularity (high interdaily stability and 24-hr autocorrelation; amplitude positive).
  - High social time and low substance use.
- Overall: notable psychological symptom burden (CES-D, STAI) and physiological arousal point upward relative to Participant 2’s population mean (21.59), but many objective and behavioral buffers moderate the inference.

Comparative weighing within each population frame
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s top risk indicators (GAD-7 with r = 0.77; BASIS-24 emotional lability r = 0.66; high PSQI) are both highly elevated and have much larger correlations with PSS in that cohort than Participant 2’s strongest predictors do in their cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.27; STAI r ≈ 0.31). That makes Participant 1’s excess-risk signals more predictive of above-mean PSS within their sample.
- Extremity of objective disturbance: Participant 1’s objectively very short sleep (~4 hours) and blunted circadian amplitude are more extreme and more directly tied to higher PSS in that dataset than Participant 2’s objective sleep (which is adequate) and circadian measures (which are generally protective).
- Balance of protective factors: Participant 2 has several strong protective/mitigating features (good objective sleep duration, strong interdaily stability, high social time) that likely attenuate PSS despite elevated mood/anxiety scores. Participant 1’s major protective factor (high self-efficacy) is strong but appears less able to fully offset multiple very high-risk signals (anxiety, sleep deprivation, pain, emotional lability).
- Correlational impact: Many of Participant 1’s elevated measures have larger correlations with PSS in their cohort (i.e., carry more predictive weight) than Participant 2’s elevated measures do in theirs.

Conclusion
Weighing the magnitude of elevated, high-correlation predictors and the extremity of objective disturbance (particularly very short sleep and strong anxiety/emotional-lability signals) for Participant 1 against Participant 2’s elevated but more modestly correlated symptoms plus several clear protective signals, Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

- High sedentary/screen time (very large Zs for video games, TV, internet) — could reduce active coping and social engagement, modestly associated with higher PSS.  
- Low social-trust (Z = -2.39) — potential interpersonal strain or less perceived social support.  
- Later sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:04 AM) — may cause social/scheduling strain despite adequate duration.  
- Elevated cardiac tone signals (heart-rate mesor and amplitude mildly high; resting HR slightly above average) — small positive correlations with PSS in the sample.  
- Very low exercise frequency — removes a behavioral stress buffer.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Moderate-to-clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 10.5) — strong predictor here (correlation with PSS ≈ 0.77).  
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8.5) — clinically elevated and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.55).  
- Elevated pain and interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) — positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.43–0.47).  
- Emotional lability (BASIS-24 subscale) — correlated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.65).  
- Nocturnal/evening heart-rate elevations (substantive + deviations around midnight–2am) — these nocturnal HR deviations have appreciable positive correlations with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.40).  
- Night-to-night sleep variability/fragmentation — can exacerbate subjective stress even when mean duration is long.

Comparative, within-population-frame reasoning
- Each profile is presented relative to its own study mean. Participant 1’s description emphasizes multiple strong protective signals tightly linked to lower perceived stress (very low CES-D and STAI-Trait scores, high self-esteem and momentary happiness, very regular circadian metrics and good sleep regularity). The listed risk factors for Participant 1 are present but described as smaller in magnitude and more behaviorally oriented (sedentary time, late timing, low exercise), with modest correlations to PSS in that sample. The population SD for Participant 1’s study is fairly small (SD = 3.65), and the summary implies Participant 1 is likely near the lower quartile — i.e., meaningfully below mean PSS.  
- Participant 2’s description contains several direct, moderately-to-strongly correlated predictors of higher PSS within that sample: GAD-7 (strong correlation 0.77), PSQI (r ≈ 0.55), emotional lability (r ≈ 0.65), pain measures (r ≈ 0.43–0.47), and nocturnal HR elevations (r up to ≈ 0.40). While Participant 2 also has protective features (self-efficacy, circadian regularity, low resting HR, low substance use), the summary explicitly states the preponderance of evidence points to perceived stress above that study’s mean (population SD = 7.51, larger variability but the risk signals are described as “meaningful”).  
- Relative weight of evidence: Participant 1’s strongest signals are protective and tightly linked to lower PSS, whereas Participant 2’s strongest signals are risk indicators that have large correlations with PSS in that sample (notably GAD-7 and PSQI). Even accounting for different population means and SDs, the pattern for Participant 2 more consistently aligns with higher perceived stress relative to peers, while Participant 1 more consistently aligns with lower perceived stress relative to their peers.

- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (disturbed sleep) — PSQI correlates positively with PSS in this sample and could push perceived stress upward.
- Within-day behavioral fragmentation: modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.10) and substantial sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 94 min) — these features are positively associated with PSS in the cohort.
- Late sleep onset and early-morning HR deviations: median sleep start ≈ 00:50 and several negative early-morning HR departures that (in aggregated form) show small positive associations with PSS in this sample.  
Overall note: these are relatively modest signals in the description; the stronger, multiple protective indicators (low trait anxiety/depression, low RHR, good circadian regularity, high self-esteem, healthy behaviors) lead the summary to conclude the participant is likely below the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean of 20.75)
- Strong self-reported symptom signals that correlate highly with PSS: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; PSQI r ≈ 0.59), mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5; r ≈ 0.80), and emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 6.33; r ≈ 0.67). These survey measures are described as among the strongest predictors of higher PSS.
- Pain and functional interference: PEG-3 = 5.56 and PAPAS = 55, both positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.47–0.50), adding to psychosocial burden.
- Noisy nocturnal autonomic signals: several late-night HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with arousal-linked stress.
- Wearable-derived protective signals (strong circadian amplitude and regularity, consolidated daytime activation, long objective sleep) are present but are described as moderating rather than outweighing the strong self-report indicators of elevated stress.

Comparative reasoning within the sample-relative frame
- Each description is already evaluated against its own population mean: Participant 1 is characterized as likely below their population mean PSS (21.62), whereas Participant 2 is characterized as likely above their population mean PSS (20.75).
- Strength of predictive signals: Participant 2’s elevated self-report measures (anxiety, emotional lability, poor subjective sleep) have very strong correlations with PSS in that dataset (e.g., GAD-7 r = 0.80), and the summary explicitly notes these as primary contributors to higher inferred PSS. Participant 1’s features that point toward higher stress are weaker and fewer (mainly subjective sleep disturbance, modest behavioral fragmentation, late sleep onset) and are explicitly outweighed by several robust protective indicators (low trait anxiety/depression, low resting HR, good circadian regularity, high self-esteem, healthy behaviors).
- Net balance of evidence: Participant 1’s profile is predominantly protective and described as below-mean; Participant 2’s profile contains multiple high-weight, survey-based indicators that are strongly predictive of higher PSS and is described as above-mean despite physiological strengths.

Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress.

- Pain and activity interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS values are above the median and moderately correlated with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47), indicating a pain-related burden that can raise stress.
- Interpersonal strain: BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54 indicates elevated interpersonal difficulties that can reduce perceived social support.
- Elevated basal physiology: mesor and resting HR Z ≈ 1.16–1.22 could reflect higher autonomic arousal associated with stress (even if correlations with PSS are weak).
- Mild anxiety: GAD-7 = 5.5 (above 0) and GAD-7 has a strong correlation with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.77), so even mild anxiety contributes risk.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Late sleep timing and some subjective sleep disturbance: median sleep start ≈ 02:19 AM and PSQI = 6 (above common cutoff), which are associated with greater stress in the dataset.
- Nocturnal physiological activation: pronounced HR deviation at midnight–1 AM (mean deviation ~9.8 bpm; Z ≈ 1.66) and elevated HR at 1–2 AM (Z ≈ 1.18), suggesting late-night arousal that can relate to perceived stress.
- Some circadian attenuation/reduced stability: lower amplitude (Z ≈ -0.57) and slightly reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.16), which modestly associate with higher PSS in this dataset.
- Lower health satisfaction and slightly lower reported happiness (modest signals concordant with higher stress).

Participant 2’s integrated interpretation was more clearly “below the population mean” PSS = 21.61.

The NGSE–PSS relationship is strong (r ≈ -0.63), which favors a lower inferred PSS for Participant 1, producing an overall inference near/slightly below mean.
- Participant 2 has targeted risk factors (late timing, PSQI = 6, nocturnal HR spikes), but stronger and more clear protective signals: very low depression (CES‑D Z ≈ -1.28) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ -1.02), higher self-esteem (Z ≈ 1.10), good socializing and academic indicators, and generally healthy physiology. The low depression/anxiety scores are potent predictors of lower PSS in the dataset.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Both participants show mixed signals, but the study write-ups explicitly conclude Participant 1 is near/slightly below their population mean while Participant 2 is below their population mean. Participant 1’s risk factors (very poor subjective sleep, pain/interference, interpersonal strain) are somewhat more substantial and directly associated with PSS than Participant 2’s primary risk (late sleep timing and nocturnal HR), even though Participant 1 also has strong protective resources.
- Overall, given that Participant 1 is inferred near the sample mean (or only slightly below) while Participant 2 is inferred more clearly below their sample mean, Participant 1 is the more likely of the two to exhibit the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) when comparing them within their respective population frames.

24,77872,33,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS:
- Strongly elevated self-report predictors of stress: severe generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, Z = 1.51) and very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 18.5, Z = 1.65), both of which have substantial positive correlations with PSS in this sample (GAD‑7 r = 0.74, PSQI r = 0.43).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Z = 1.03) and pain/interference (PEG‑3 elevated), both positively associated with PSS (BASIS r = 0.63).
- Lower self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44), which is negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.66), suggesting fewer perceived coping resources.
- The summary explicitly infers PSS above the study mean (20.54), with multiple convergent subjective indicators driving that inference despite some objective resilience.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS:
- Late habitual sleep timing (~01:58 AM) and somewhat short median sleep duration (6 h 50 min, Z = -0.44) that can increase daytime strain and stress, especially in context-dependent demands.
- Reduced socializing (Z ≈ -0.62) and somewhat lower reported happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), which correlate with higher PSS in the cohort.
- Evening and late‑night heart‑rate elevations (notable positive hourly deviations) that may reflect evening arousal or misalignment and could increase perceived stress or interfere with sleep.
- Note: these risk factors are present but described as smaller in magnitude and less consistent than the protective indicators.

Comparative, within-population reasoning:
- Each description is relative to its own study mean. Participant 1 is explicitly characterized as above their population mean (20.54); Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean (21.62).
- The strength and size of the stress-related signals differ: Participant 1 shows multiple large, strongly correlated subjective predictors (high z-scores, large correlations with PSS) that converge on elevated perceived stress. Participant 2’s stress risks are smaller in magnitude and are counterbalanced by protective features (low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self‑esteem, robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability).
- Objective physiology for Participant 1 shows some protective circadian organization, but the report states these do not outweigh the strong subjective signal. Participant 2’s physiology and trait measures more consistently point to below-mean stress.
- Overall balance of evidence (magnitude, number, and predictive strength of indicators) favors Participant 1 as having the worse (higher) perceived stress.

5,57443,14,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 19; Z = 0.59) — CES-D correlates positively with PSS in the sample (~r = 0.28).  
- Trait anxiety (STAI = 40) aligns with chronic anxiety proneness and STAI correlates positively with PSS (~r = 0.31).  
- Modestly elevated cardiovascular tone: mesor (Z = 0.85) and resting HR (Z = 0.36) and early-morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.22).  
- Small positive association between intradaily variability and PSS (participant near mean but any increase could contribute).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean)
- Severe and objectively short sleep (median ~3 h/night) and very large night-to-night sleep-timing variability (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82) — sleep measures strongly correlate with PSS in this sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50).  
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13.5) reinforcing the objective sleep signal.  
- Elevated anxiety/emotional lability: GAD-7 = 9 (r with PSS ≈ 0.78), BASIS-24 emotional lability (Z = 0.43; r ≈ 0.68). These are highly PSS-associated in the sample.  
- Substance-related problems (BASIS-24 substance abuse Z = 1.75) and pain-related interference (measures that correlate positively with PSS) that plausibly increase perceived stress.  
- Marked circadian instability (interdaily stability Z = -1.42; amplitude Z = -1.10; autocorrelation Z = -0.68) — rhythm disruption correlates with higher PSS in the sample.

Comparative reasoning (within each study frame)
- Both descriptions are anchored to similar population means (P1 mean = 21.61; P2 mean = 21.33), so relative inferences are comparable.  
- Participant 1 shows a mixed profile: some affective and modest physiological signals that push toward higher stress, but multiple robust protective factors (strong circadian regularity, normal-to-good sleep duration and low night-to-night variability, high self-esteem and happiness, minimal substance use) that counterbalance those signals. The summary explicitly concludes P1 is near the population mean with only a modest upward bias.  
- Participant 2 presents multiple, concordant, strongly PSS-associated risk signals: extreme objective and subjective sleep disturbance, high anxiety/emotional lability with very strong sample correlations to PSS, substance-related problems, and circadian rhythm disruption. Although Participant 2 has a strong protective factor (very high self-efficacy) and low resting HR, the strongest and most PSS-correlated measures (sleep, anxiety, emotional lability, substance issues, circadian instability) point together toward elevated perceived stress. The summary explicitly concludes P2 is above their population mean.  
- The magnitude and number of PSS-linked risk signals are substantially greater for Participant 2 than for Participant 1. Participant 1’s elevated indicators are modest and offset by clear protective factors; Participant 2’s elevated indicators are large, objective (very short sleep), and strongly correlated with PSS in that sample.

Conclusion
- Weighting the quantity, magnitude, and strength of measures that predict higher PSS (and taking into account that each profile is judged relative to its own population mean), Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

7,43794,15,26,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (as described, relative to their study population)
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 15.5 (z = +0.67 → clearly poor sleep and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS, r ≈ 0.53).
- Very short median wearable sleep duration (4 h 22 min) and very large night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD = 216 min, z = +0.89; sleep onset SD z ≈ +0.34). Severe short sleep and high variability are strong stress correlates.
- Elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships score z = +2.34), a contextual psychosocial risk factor that commonly increases perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian regularity and blunted rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24 h autocorrelation, cosinor amplitude z ≈ −0.84): these objective rhythm disruptions often co-occur with elevated stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (as described, relative to their study population)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, z = +1.35), a strong self-report predictor positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Objectively elevated resting heart rate (70.8 bpm, z = +1.50), indicating greater autonomic arousal associated with higher perceived stress.
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8, z = +0.59) plus substantial night-to-night sleep timing/duration variability (sleep duration SD z = +1.25; sleep start SD z = +0.86).
- Marked circadian rhythm disruption: very low interdaily stability (z = −1.73) and blunted amplitude (z = −1.76), plus elevated intradaily fragmentation—objective signatures that commonly track with higher stress.
- Lower positive psychosocial indicators (reduced happiness and self-esteem z-scores), which add psychosocial weight toward elevated perceived stress.

Comparative, within-study-frame reasoning
- Participant 1’s indicators are mixed: very severe objective sleep restriction/variability and high interpersonal strain point toward above-mean perceived stress, but multiple protective signals (very low current anxiety GAD-7 z = −1.38, low pain, low emotional lability, near-average self-efficacy, lower resting HR) counterbalance those risks. The original integrative judgement concluded “near the sample mean, with a modest tilt toward above the mean.”
- Participant 2’s indicators are more consistently aligned toward elevated stress: elevated trait anxiety, higher resting HR, objectively blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability, plus sleep timing variability. Although some mitigators exist (near-7 h median sleep, low depressive score, some leisure/social behaviors), the convergence of psychological (trait anxiety) and physiological (HR and circadian) signals was judged by the original summary to support “above the population mean.”
- Magnitude and consistency matter: Participant 1 has a few very large risk signals (extremely short median sleep; interpersonal z ≈ +2.34) but also several strong protective signals, leading to an overall ambiguous/near-mean picture. Participant 2 shows multiple moderate-to-strong indicators pointing in the same direction (anxiety, HR, circadian dysregulation, sleep variability), producing a clearer, more coherent elevation relative to that study’s mean.

Overall balance of evidence
- Both participants have reasons to be above their respective sample means, but Participant 2’s multimodal signals are more consistently and coherently indicative of elevated perceived stress (psychological + physiological + circadian), whereas Participant 1’s profile is more mixed (serious sleep/circadian problems and interpersonal strain but low anxiety and low physiological arousal).
- Therefore Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

- Lower self‑esteem and modestly lower happiness/health satisfaction (small negative Zs) that align with higher stress appraisal.
- Relatively short objective sleep duration (median ~6 h 9 min, Z ≈ -1.29), which can exacerbate stress reactivity even though subjective sleep quality is acceptable.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean):
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18, Z ≈ +1.51) with a very strong correlation to PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.75) — the single strongest predictor shown.
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +0.83) plus very short median sleep (~4 h 55 min) and late sleep onset, consistent with sleep-related contributors to perceived stress.
- High pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS Z ≈ +1.4–1.6), which correlate positively with PSS and increase daily strain.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -1.73), a robust negative predictor of PSS (r ≈ -0.61).
- Physiological evidence of nocturnal hyperarousal (large positive nightly HR deviations, some Zs >2) that align with the symptom profile.
- Integrated conclusion in the description: overall pattern is consistent with perceived stress above the population mean.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame:
- Strength and consistency of predictors: Participant 2 presents multiple large, coherent symptom signals (severe anxiety, major sleep disturbance, pain interference, low self‑efficacy) that are strongly and directly linked to PSS in their sample (notably the very large anxiety–PSS correlation). Participant 1’s symptom signals are milder (moderate anxiety/depression Z ≈ +0.66–0.70) and the correlations of those measures with PSS in their sample are smaller (~0.28–0.31).
- Physiological/sleep evidence: Both participants show short sleep, but Participant 2’s sleep disruption is more extreme (~4 h 55 min vs ~6 h 9 min) and accompanied by marked nocturnal HR elevations, suggesting stronger physiological arousal tied to stress. Participant 1 shows short but regular sleep and robust circadian metrics that likely buffer stress.
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has several behavioral/physiological buffers (frequent exercise, low substance use, strong circadian regularity and high amplitude, low intradaily variability) that the summary explicitly credits with attenuating PSS. Participant 2 does have some circadian regularity protective signs, but these are described as partial mitigators that do not outweigh the strong symptom signals.
- Relative magnitude vs population means: Each description already judges position relative to its own population mean. Participant 1 is described as near to modestly above their mean (a small elevation). Participant 2 is described as above their mean with several large Zs and strong correlational links — a clearer and larger elevation.

Weighing the balance of evidence:
- Participant 2 shows stronger, more numerous, and more strongly correlated markers of perceived stress (severe anxiety with very large r to PSS, severe sleep disturbance, high pain interference, very high nocturnal HR deviations, and low self‑efficacy).
- Participant 1 shows some elevated internalizing symptoms but also multiple robust behavioral and circadian buffers that are explicitly said to likely attenuate perceived stress, resulting in only a slight elevation above their sample mean.

8,22455,20,30,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Wearable circadian/behavioral markers consistent with stress: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These features are modestly positively correlated with PSS in that sample.
- Shorter-than-average median nightly sleep (6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33) and elevated sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94), both weakly associated with higher PSS.
- High sedentary/leisure time (TV/internet/music use; TV Z ≈ +2.54) which is weakly associated with greater PSS in the sample.
- Unusual early-morning heart-rate deviations (large positive Zs at 5–7 AM) that are physiologically atypical and could reflect early awakenings, nocturnal arousal, or activity—potentially related to stress (though interpretation is uncertain).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Strong, highly correlated self-report predictors of PSS are elevated: GAD-7 = 8 (mild anxiety) and GAD-7 has very high correlation with PSS (r = 0.77). PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep; r ≈ 0.49 with PSS). Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63; r ≈ 0.66). Pain/interference indicators also positively correlated with PSS.
- Wearable physiology and circadian features consistent with higher PSS: elevated resting HR (76.35 bpm, Z = +1.19) and MESOR (Z = +1.24), reduced diurnal amplitude (Z = -1.05), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.46), and high intradaily variability (Z = +1.07). These indicate blunted day–night rhythm and fragmented activity, patterns associated with stress.
- Pronounced early-morning heart-rate elevations (1–8 AM hours with Z > 1) that correlate moderately with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.38–0.41 for 1–4 AM).
- Objective sleep severely compromised: extremely short median nightly sleep (1 h 39 min, Z ≈ -1.27) and very late sleep onset (~04:36 AM) with naps present. These sleep characteristics align strongly with hyperarousal and higher perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Participant 1: the strongest, most directly PSS-predictive measures in that sample are self-report affect measures (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, happiness/health). These are favorable for Participant 1 (low trait anxiety, near-mean CES-D, high happiness/health), and those measures have substantive correlations with PSS (STAI r ≈ 0.32; CES-D r ≈ 0.29). Objective wearable signs point toward mild circadian disruption and reduced sleep, but those features have weaker correlations with PSS in that sample and some physiological anomalies are ambiguous/artifactual.
- Participant 2: multiple of the highest-correlation predictors of PSS are elevated (GAD-7 r = 0.77; emotional lability r = 0.66; low self-efficacy r = -0.65; PSQI r = 0.49). Wearable markers and objective sleep strongly align with hyperarousal and circadian disruption. Several independent, highly correlated indicators converge on above-mean perceived stress in Participant 2’s study frame.
- Weighting stronger predictors more heavily: Participant 1’s high-weight predictors (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, happiness/health) point toward below-mean PSS; Participant 2’s high-weight predictors (anxiety, emotional lability, PSQI, self-efficacy) point toward above-mean PSS.

Overall balance of evidence
- Participant 2 presents multiple, convergent signals—especially self-report measures with large correlations to PSS—indicating perceived stress above their study mean. Participant 1 shows some objective circadian/sleep irregularities that could elevate stress but has stronger, high-correlation self-report indicators pointing below their sample mean.
- Therefore Participant 2 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their study population).

- Altered circadian/HR rhythm metrics consistent with stress (high resting HR Z = 1.67, low circadian amplitude Z = -1.57, elevated intradaily variability Z = 1.23, low interdaily stability Z = -1.34).  
- Elevated emotional lability and pain-related interference (BASIS‑24 and PEG‑3) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Although there is a modest protective factor (slightly higher self‑efficacy), the constellation and strength of anxiety + sleep + nocturnal arousal indicators strongly favor higher perceived stress relative to the study mean.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Objective sleep/circadian irregularity: very late median sleep start (02:54), modestly short median sleep (6 h 34 m; Z = -0.76), high night‑to‑night sleep variability (SD Z = 1.62), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.30), low 24‑hr autocorrelation (Z = -0.87), and slightly increased mean daily naps (Z = 1.49). These features are associated with higher PSS in the literature and show small positive sample correlations with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.13–0.15).  
- However, these wearable/circadian indicators have only modest correlations with PSS in this cohort and thus provide weaker evidence for higher perceived stress.

Comparative weighing of the evidence (within each study’s frame)
- Strength and relevance of associations: Participant 1’s strongest signals (high GAD‑7, disturbed PSQI, extreme objective sleep loss, nocturnal HR elevations) are tied to PSS by relatively large sample correlations (e.g., GAD‑7 r = 0.80; emotional lability r = 0.66; nocturnal HR r ≈ 0.28–0.42). Participant 2’s potentially stressful features (sleep timing variability, intradaily variability) are only weakly associated with PSS in that sample (r ≈ 0.13–0.15).  
- Magnitude of objective disturbance: Participant 1 shows extreme objective impairment (median sleep ~2h), marked nocturnal physiological arousal, and elevated resting HR—more severe deviations than Participant 2’s moderate sleep shortening and variability.  
- Subjective reports: Participant 2 reports low depression/anxiety and high wellbeing (strong indicators below that study’s mean PSS), whereas Participant 1 reports moderate-to-high anxiety and poor sleep quality (indicators above that study’s mean).  
- Net assessment: The pattern for Participant 1 is both stronger and more directly linked to PSS in that study than the weaker, partially contradictory pattern for Participant 2 (objective irregularity vs. robust subjective wellbeing).

- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.62) and moderate pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS), both positively linked to PSS in the sample.  
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular arousal (resting HR and mesor Z ≈ +1.5), consistent with sustained physiological stress.  
- Multiple converging modalities (symptoms, sleep, physiology) point in the same direction; protective signals are modest and do not counterbalance the above.

- Circadian/cardiac fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ 1.09, reduced 24‑h autocorrelation) and somewhat shortened sleep (median ≈ 6 h 46 min, Z ≈ −0.52), consonant with higher PSS.  
- Low self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29) which modestly predicts greater PSS.  
- However, substantial protective factors: frequent exercise (Z ≈ 1.1–1.6), no substance use, relatively low resting HR (Z ≈ −0.42), and above‑average self‑reported happiness — all likely to mitigate perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective study mean PSS. The difference lies in magnitude and convergence of indicators. Participant 1 shows stronger, clinically severe symptomatology (notably severe anxiety and very poor subjective sleep) and elevated physiological arousal, with multiple high-weight correlates of PSS (e.g., GAD r = 0.81, PSQI r = 0.51). Several of Participant 1’s Z‑scores on physiological measures are in the +1.4–+1.5 range, indicating substantial deviation from their sample mean.  
- Participant 2 shows moderate elevations in affective symptoms and circadian fragmentation, but these are partly offset by robust protective lifestyle and physiological markers (frequent exercise, low resting HR, no substance use, higher happiness). The net description explicitly characterizes Participant 2’s PSS elevation as “moderate” rather than extreme.  
- In short, Participant 1’s profile has more extreme and concordant risk indicators for perceived stress, whereas Participant 2’s risks are milder and balanced by stronger protective factors.

19,95374,28,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Elevated affective symptoms that correlate with PSS in that sample:
  - CES-D = 28 (z = +1.53); CES-D correlates with PSS ≈ 0.29.
  - STAI = 47 (z = +0.56); STAI correlates with PSS ≈ 0.31.
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9, z = +1.05), which is positively associated with PSS (though the sample correlation described is modest, r ≈ 0.15–0.18 here).
- Objective sleep timing/variability risk: very large night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD z = +2.68) and late/variable sleep onset (median ~03:11 AM, start-time SD z = +1.43); these sleep irregularities are associated with higher PSS in the sample.
- Low current happiness (z = −1.61), which in the sample associates with higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Strongly predictive anxiety and sleep signals:
  - GAD-7 = 10 (moderate anxiety); GAD-7 has a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.78), making this a highly relevant predictor.
  - PSQI = 16.5 (z = +1.0) and PSQI–PSS correlation is substantial (r = 0.47), so subjective sleep disturbance strongly points to higher PSS.
- Severe objective nocturnal disturbance and short sleep:
  - Median nightly sleep duration ~2 h 38 min (z = −0.94) and very late/variable sleep onset (start SD z = +1.3) — extreme objective sleep impairment that is associated with higher PSS.
  - Elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations (e.g., 1–2 AM +13.54 bpm, z = 1.17; 3–4 AM +9.79 bpm, z = 1.59) and overnight HR deviations correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Pain-related interference (PAPAS) positively correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.48) and is slightly elevated for this participant.

Comparative reasoning (accounting for within-sample correlations and z-scores)
- Both participants are described as above their respective study means. The key question is which profile more strongly predicts higher perceived stress given the pattern of correlations and effect sizes reported within each sample.
- Participant 1’s above-mean indicators (depression, trait anxiety, poor PSQI, extreme sleep variability and late timing, low happiness) do indicate elevated stress risk, but many of these predictors in that sample have only modest correlations with PSS (CES‑D/STAI r ≈ 0.29–0.31; sleep metrics r ≈ 0.15–0.18). Participant 1 also has several notable protective features (strong circadian amplitude and autocorrelation z-scores, low resting HR, higher self‑esteem and social time) that are negatively associated with PSS and could attenuate overall perceived stress.
- Participant 2’s high-stress signals include measures that, in that study, have larger effect-size relationships with PSS: GAD‑7 with very large correlation (r ≈ 0.78), PSQI with moderate-large correlation (r ≈ 0.47), and pain with a moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.48). In addition, Participant 2 shows extreme objective sleep compromise (very short median sleep, strong nocturnal HR elevations, high sleep onset variability) that align with those strong correlates. Although Participant 2 has protective traits (self-efficacy, low emotional lability) that correlate with PSS, the most salient and highly predictive indicators for this participant are strongly tied to PSS in that sample.
- In short, Participant 2’s strongest predictors of perceived stress are both higher in effect size (within their sample) and more extreme in the participant’s data (severe short sleep and nocturnal arousal, and GAD‑7 at the clinical threshold) than Participant 1’s strongest predictors, which are more moderate and partially offset by robust physiological circadian protection.

Overall determination
- Based on the balance of evidence, Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (higher PSS) relative to their population mean.

9,30453,12,23,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Severe subjective and objective sleep problems: PSQI classified as “Disturbed Sleep” and very short median wearable sleep duration (≈3 h 27 m). In the sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46), so these sleep indices are plausible contributors to elevated perceived stress.
- High intradaily variability (Z = 2.29) indicating fragmented rest–activity patterns; intradaily variability shows a positive (though modest) association with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.24).
- Elevated interpersonal-strain score (BASIS-24 interpersonal relationships Z ≈ 0.94), which could add psychosocial stress (even though its correlation with PSS in the sample is small).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS
- Strongly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 31, Z = 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI ≈ 51, Z ≈ 0.96); both scale scores are known to correlate positively with PSS in this dataset and are potent predictors of higher perceived stress.
- Extremely poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = 4.29), one of the largest single signals in either profile and a robust correlate of higher PSS.
- Objective physiological and circadian dysregulation consistent with stress: elevated resting heart rate and mesor, reduced circadian amplitude, low interdaily stability, and elevated intradaily variability — these provide independent, convergent objective support for elevated perceived stress.
- Behavioral/psychosocial strain: late/variable sleep timing, shorter-than-average median sleep (≈6 h 25 m, Z ≈ −0.96), lower self-esteem, reduced happiness and health satisfaction — all align with greater perceived stress.

Comparative, within-population framing and weighing of evidence
- Each description is already interpreted relative to its own study population mean. Participant 1’s summary explicitly leans toward below-mean PSS, driven by very strong protective indicators with high sample-level associations (notably low GAD-7 with r ≈ 0.76 and high NGSE with r ≈ −0.65). The main risk signals for Participant 1 are sleep-related (severe short sleep and fragmentation) and interpersonal strain, but the sleep-to-PSS association in this sample is moderate and other high-weight predictors point toward lower stress.
- Participant 2’s summary explicitly leans toward above-mean PSS, supported by multiple, strong, converging signals across self-report (high depression and anxiety, extreme PSQI) and objective physiology/circadian measures (elevated RHR/mesor, reduced amplitude, instability). Several of these signals show large Z-scores and are established correlates of PSS in the dataset.
- Weighing the balance: Participant 2 shows more numerous and larger-magnitude risk indicators that converge across domains (mood, sleep, physiology, circadian regularity). Participant 1’s high-risk sleep signals are important but are counterbalanced by very strong protective signals that, in this sample, have larger correlations with PSS. Participant 2’s protective behaviors (exercise, low substance use) mitigate risk but do not outweigh the multiple strong risk signals.

- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 24; Z ≈ 1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z ≈ 0.86), both above the study mean and positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). These are the strongest psychosocial indicators pointing toward higher perceived stress.
- Sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) plus late median sleep onset (~01:44) and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 159 min, Z ≈ 1.32), which align with higher PSS.
- Reduced circadian regularity (lower interdaily stability, amplitude, and 24-h autocorrelation; Zs ≈ -0.57 to -0.70), consistent with stress-related rhythm disruption.
- Low social trust (Z ≈ -1.74) and lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95), vulnerabilities that can increase stress reactivity.

Factors limiting the inference of very high PSS for Participant 1 (protective or stress-lowering signals):
- Very high self-esteem (39/40) and above-average current happiness (protective; both negatively correlated with PSS).
- Regular exercise (≥3×/week) and low resting HR (53 bpm, Z ≈ -0.61), both associated with lower tonic stress.
- Low recreational drug use and modest alcohol use.
Overall balance (within-sample): evidence tilts toward PSS above the population mean but likely a moderate elevation, partly offset by several notable protective factors.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to Participant 2’s study population mean):
- Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) where anxiety has a very strong sample-level correlation with PSS (r = 0.77). Even though z = 0.11, the strong predictor weight in this sample makes this salient.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5) with substantial correlation to PSS (r = 0.49).
- Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 = 9.67; Z ≈ 0.93) strongly associated with PSS (r = 0.67).
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE = 27; Z ≈ -0.62) with strong negative correlation to PSS (r = -0.66).
- Somatic burden/pain interference (PEG-3 ≈ 5.0) that correlates with higher PSS.
- Physiological/behavioral signals consistent with elevated arousal: high resting HR (77.6 bpm, Z ≈ 1.31), elevated MESOR (Z ≈ 1.19), and very large sleep variability (SD = 232 min, Z ≈ 1.12).

Factors limiting the inference of uniformly extreme PSS for Participant 2 (protective or stress-lowering signals):
- Median sleep duration around 7 hours (z ≈ 0.56), some preserved restorative time.
- Low intradaily variability (z ≈ -1.20) and modestly higher circadian amplitude and positive 24-h autocorrelation — indicating relatively consolidated daily rhythms.
- Wearable-derived circadian metrics in this sample show weak or inconsistent correlations with PSS overall, so physiology is supportive but mixed.
Overall balance (within-sample): multiple strong, high-weight self-report predictors (anxiety, sleep quality, emotional lability, low self-efficacy) and supportive physiology (high resting HR, MESOR, large sleep variability) point toward PSS clearly above the population mean.

Comparative reasoning (within each participant’s population frame):
- Strength/weight of predictors: Participant 2’s key self-report predictors (GAD-7, PSQI, emotional lability, NGSE) have substantially stronger sample-level correlations with PSS (e.g., r up to ~0.77) than Participant 1’s strongest predictors (CES-D, STAI with r ≈ 0.28–0.31). This makes Participant 2’s elevated measures more diagnostically informative for higher PSS in their sample.
- Magnitude and direction of physiological signals: Participant 2 shows high resting HR and MESOR (z > 1), consistent with higher baseline arousal; Participant 1 shows low resting HR (protective). Sleep disruption is present in both, but Participant 2’s sleep problems (PSQI = 13.5, SD = 232 min) are more extreme and coupled with stronger self-report links to PSS than Participant 1’s (PSQI = 7, SD = 159 min).
- Protective factors: Participant 1 has stronger psychological resilience markers (very high self-esteem, higher happiness, regular exercise) which likely attenuate perceived stress; Participant 2 has fewer strong protective psychosocial resources and more and stronger risk correlates.
- Overall coherence: Participant 2’s pattern is more convergent (multiple strong self-report risk factors + physiological signs of elevated arousal), whereas Participant 1’s pattern is more mixed (some strong mood symptoms but also clear protective resources and weaker sample-level correlations).

18,24029,18,30,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean = 21.59)
- Elevated symptom-level affect: CES-D = 21 (Z ≈ 0.8, classified “Depressed”) and STAI = 50 (Z ≈ 0.86, “anxious”), both positively correlated with PSS in this cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).  
- Moderate sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (marginal disturbance) and slightly short median sleep (6 h 46 min; Z ≈ −0.52), which tend to co-occur with higher PSS.  
- Circadian/HR fragmentation: high intradaily variability (0.70; Z ≈ 1.09) and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ −0.53) — metrics that, in this sample, associate with higher PSS.  
- Low self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.29), which is negatively correlated with PSS in the sample (so lower self‑esteem → higher expected PSS).  
- Taken together these clinical symptom and circadian-fragmentation signals point toward perceived stress above the population mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their population mean = 21.17)
- High anxiety with strong sample-level association: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z ≈ 0.9) and GAD-7–PSS correlation in this sample is very large (r ≈ 0.80).  
- Large emotion-lability signal (BASIS-24 elevated; r ≈ 0.66 with PSS).  
- Severe sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 (disturbed), objectively extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 min; Z ≈ −1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (median ~02:49, start SD Z ≈ 1.16). Sleep measures here have moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS (e.g., PSQI r ≈ 0.49).  
- Physiological arousal and circadian flattening: high resting HR (81.2 bpm; Z ≈ 1.67), low circadian amplitude (Z ≈ −1.57), low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.23). Nocturnal HR elevations (~+8–9 bpm at 12–2 AM) with positive correlations to PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Pain/interference (PEG-3) also positively associated with PSS in this sample.  
- Protective factors (modestly higher self-efficacy) are present but small relative to the many strong risk signals.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and weighting of evidence
- Both participants are described as likely above their respective population PSS means. Important contextual point: each profile must be judged relative to its own cohort baseline.  
- Magnitude and strength of risk signals: Participant 2 shows more extreme and more numerous indicators tied strongly to PSS in that sample: a very large GAD-7→PSS correlation (r ≈ 0.80), objectively severe and highly variable sleep loss/late timing, marked nocturnal HR elevations, and large Z-scores on resting HR and circadian amplitude/stability. Many of these metrics have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS.  
- Participant 1’s risk indicators are meaningful but more moderate (CES-D and STAI elevated but with smaller sample correlations to PSS), and several protective factors (frequent exercise, no substance use, low resting HR, above-average happiness) partially offset risk signals. The Z-scores and correlations reported for Participant 1’s risk features are generally smaller than the extremes seen for Participant 2.  
- Given (a) the severity and concordance of sleep/circadian/physiological arousal indicators for Participant 2, (b) the very strong anxiety–PSS association in that sample, and (c) Participant 1’s notable protective behaviors that mitigate their moderate symptom signals, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely to have the higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their cohort.

8,45076,20,29,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean 21.08)
- Strongly correlated self-report risk signals:
  - GAD-7 = 8 with very high dataset correlation to PSS (r = 0.77) — notable contributor even though absolute anxiety is “mild.”
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 Z = 0.63; r = 0.66 with PSS).
  - Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13; r = 0.49 with PSS).
  - Low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44; r = -0.65 with PSS) and pain interference (PEG/PAPAS) also correlate with higher PSS.
- Converging wearable physiology consistent with hyperarousal and circadian disruption:
  - Elevated resting HR and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.19–1.24).
  - Reduced diurnal amplitude (Z ≈ -1.05) and higher intradaily variability (Z ≈ 1.07), indicating blunted/fragmented circadian rhythm.
  - Pronounced early‑morning HR elevations (1–4 AM) with moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.38–0.41).
- Objective sleep timing/quantity consistent with stress-related dysfunction:
  - Extremely short median nightly sleep (1 h 39 min; Z = -1.27) and very late sleep onset (~04:36 AM), plus some napping — pattern consistent with nocturnal hyperarousal and higher perceived stress.
- Mitigating notes (weighing down but not negating above):
  - Anxiety level is mild rather than severe, some correlations are mixed or weak, and the very short wearable sleep could reflect recording artifacts. Still, multiple independent, high-correlation signals point above the mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean 21.6)
- Modest risk signals that push toward higher PSS:
  - Trait anxiety (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27) and mild depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 15; Z = 0.18) — both positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
  - PSQI = 6, indicating subjective sleep disturbance.
  - Circadian irregularity signals: lower interdaily stability (Z = -0.74) and some intradaily variability (Z = 0.32). Small positive correlations of early‑morning HR deviations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).
  - Late sleep timing (~00:57) and moderate night-to-night timing variability (SD ≈ 63 min) may reduce sleep restorative value.
- Strong mitigating/protective factors that reduce likelihood of markedly elevated PSS:
  - High self‑esteem (Z = 1.38) and frequent exercise (Z > 1), which correlate with lower PSS.
  - Healthy physiology and behaviors: adequate objective sleep duration (median 7 h 38 min; Z = 0.56), low resting HR (~57.8 bpm), low substance use, good academics — all protective.
- Net assessment in the participant’s own-frame: risk signals are generally small-to-moderate and substantially counterbalanced by protective factors, so inferred PSS is near the sample mean (perhaps slightly above) rather than clearly elevated.

Comparative reasoning within the respective population frames
- Strength and number of converging high-correlation indicators:
  - Participant 1 shows multiple measures that both deviate meaningfully and have strong correlations with PSS in that sample (notably anxiety r = 0.77, emotional lability r = 0.66, self-efficacy r = -0.65, PSQI r = 0.49). Several physiological/circadian measures also align with stress (elevated resting HR/MESOR, reduced amplitude, early‑morning HR with moderate correlations).
  - Participant 2’s risk indicators are weaker in magnitude and have smaller correlations with PSS (STAI/CES‑D r ≈ 0.28–0.31; early-morning HR r ≈ 0.19–0.21). Importantly, Participant 2 has several substantial protective factors (self‑esteem Z = 1.38, regular exercise, low RHR) that likely reduce net perceived stress.
- Relative conclusions provided in each summary:
  - P1 is explicitly inferred to be above their population mean (21.08) with multiple converging high-weight signals.
  - P2 is inferred to be near their population mean (21.6), possibly slightly above, but with large protective signals that keep overall inferred stress modest.
- Taking within-sample baselines into account: even though both descriptions suggest some elevation relative to their own samples, the magnitude, correlation strength, and convergence of risk signals are substantially greater for Participant 1 than for Participant 2.

  - Moderate anxiety (GAD-7 = 10) where GAD-7 shows a very strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.77).
  - Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 z = 0.93; r = 0.67).
  - Low general self-efficacy (NGSE z = -0.62; r = -0.66).
  - Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 13.5; r = 0.49).
- Wearable/physiological indicators that align with higher stress:

  - High night-to-night sleep variability (sleep SD z = 1.12).
- The strongest predictors in this dataset for PSS are present and concordant (anxiety, emotion dysregulation, low self-efficacy, subjective sleep problems), giving coherent, high-weight evidence for above-mean perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Substantial subjective symptom burden:
  - Very high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33, z = 2.05).
  - Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, z = 3.83).
  - Elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ 0.56) and low happiness/self-esteem.
- Wearable/physiological signs consistent with stress:
  - Mildly elevated resting HR (63.6 bpm, z = 0.65) and increased intradaily variability (IV z = 0.81), indicating some circadian fragmentation and physiological activation.
- However, several protective/tempering factors that reduce net inference for extreme perceived stress:
  - Long objective sleep (median ~8 h 10 min, z = 1.22) with low night-to-night variability (sleep SD z = -0.92).
  - Regular exercise, moderate social time, low substance use, and frequent music listening — behavioral resources that may blunt stress impact.
- Importantly, the depression and anxiety measures in this sample have only modest correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.27–0.31), so although scores are high, their direct weight for predicting PSS in this dataset is lower than some predictors present for Participant 1.

Comparative weighting and judgment (within each population frame)
- Participant 1 shows several predictors that, within their dataset, have large correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7, emotional lability, and NGSE). Those high-correlation predictors are present and concordant, and physiological signals (high resting HR, MESOR, high sleep variability) further support heightened stress.
- Participant 2 has severe depressive symptoms and very poor subjective sleep (large z-scores), which are strong clinical signals. However, in this study those particular measures (depression, trait anxiety) have only modest sample correlations with PSS, and several objective/behavioral buffers (long consistent sleep, exercise, social time, low substance use) mitigate the inference of extreme perceived stress.
- Because the dataset-level correlations indicate the variables elevated in Participant 1 carry more predictive weight for PSS than many of the elevated variables in Participant 2, and because Participant 1 also shows corroborating physiological markers (higher resting HR, greater sleep variability), the balance of evidence favors Participant 1 as having the worse (higher) perceived stress relative to their respective study population.

- Substantive sleep disturbance: very high PSQI (16.5, Z = 1.0) and objectively extreme short/irregular sleep (median 2 h 38 m, very late and highly variable sleep onset). PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r = 0.47) in this sample.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations (+13.5 bpm at 1–2am; +9.8 bpm at 3–4am) and disrupted circadian stability; overnight HR elevations correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety: GAD-7 = 10 (screening threshold for moderate anxiety). Anxiety has a very strong sample correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), making this a powerful contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Additional contributors: some pain-related interference (PAPAS = 65) which correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.48).
- Countervailing factors (noted but insufficient to override above): higher self-efficacy (protective) and low emotional lability (protective).

Participant 2 — reasons suggesting higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated physiological arousal markers: resting HR and mesor are above mean (Z ≈ 1.0–1.2) and a pronounced evening HR peak (8–9 pm deviation Z ≈ 2.09), which in this dataset have small positive associations with PSS (resting HR r ≈ 0.14).
- Late sleep timing: median sleep start ≈ 02:25 AM (possible chronotype or schedule stressor), though total sleep duration is adequate.
- Overall caveat: these signals have small correlations with PSS in the study and occur against a backdrop of strong protective indicators, so they are weak potential drivers of higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 20.75, P2 mean = 21.62). Participant 1 is explicitly inferred as likely above their population mean; Participant 2 is explicitly inferred as below their population mean.
- The magnitude and relevance of Participant 1’s risk signals are strong and directly tied to metrics that show moderate-to-strong correlations with PSS in that sample: moderate anxiety (very strong PSS correlate), severely disturbed subjective and objective sleep (moderate correlate), and nocturnal HR arousal (moderate correlate).
- Participant 2’s adverse signals are weaker, less directly tied to PSS (small correlations), and are outweighed by multiple robust protective indicators (very low depression and trait anxiety, good PSQI, strong circadian regularity, social exercise, high happiness/self-esteem).
- Therefore, even accounting for different population means, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is experiencing higher perceived stress relative to their peers, and Participant 2 is below their sample mean.

- Aggregated interpretation in the write-up explicitly concludes P1 is most consistent with being above the study mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Severe sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically elevated) and extremely short objective sleep (median ~4 h 21 min) with large timing variability — these are risk factors associated with higher PSS.

- The summary notes these nocturnal/sleep signals as the primary risk features that would elevate inferred PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a lower PSS (relative to their study population)
- Very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 2, Z ≈ -1.29); GAD-7 is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ +0.77) — this is a powerful protective signal.
- High self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.30) and other low symptom/low-pain indicators; NGSE is substantially negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.65).
- Strong circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.98; 24-h autocorr Z ≈ +1.77) and low resting HR/mesor — both protective in this sample.
- The integrated interpretation in the write-up explicitly concludes P2 is likely below the study mean despite pronounced sleep problems.

Comparative, within-population reasoning and final judgment
- Both summaries explicitly place Participant 1 above their population mean (PSS mean = 21.6) and Participant 2 below their population mean (PSS mean = 21.21).
- Participant 2’s objective sleep/overnight-arousal signals are more extreme (very short sleep, large nocturnal HR deviations) than Participant 1’s sleep deficits, which could push P2 toward higher perceived stress. However, in this study the strongest predictors of PSS are trait/daytime measures (notably anxiety and self-efficacy), and Participant 2 has very low anxiety and relatively high self-efficacy — signals with larger correlations to PSS than many sleep metrics.
- Participant 1 shows multiple moderate-risk signals (sleep timing irregularity, high nap frequency, unstable circadian metrics) combined with at least modestly elevated trait anxiety; these align consistently with an above-mean PSS in their sample.
- Given the relative strengths of the predictive signals described (strong protective trait effects for P2 vs. multiple stress-related sleep/circadian + trait signals for P1) and the explicit integrated inferences in each summary, Participant 1 is the more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

10,96689,10,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study-frame)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z ≈ +0.56) — a moderate positive correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ +0.31).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6; above clinical cutoff) — PSQI correlates positively with PSS.  
- Lower self-rated happiness and poor health satisfaction (negative Z-scores) — these are plausibly associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Very low reported exercise (Z ≤ −1.9) — removes a behavioral buffer against stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have lower PSS (countervailing evidence)
- Low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 6) and high self‑esteem (RSES = 39).  
- Objective sleep is adequate and stable (median ~7h18m, low variability).  
- Strong circadian amplitude and stability, pronounced day–night HR separation, and low resting HR (58.8 bpm).  
- Good social engagement and no substance use.  
Integrated note: the summary judges P1’s profile as mixed but ultimately slightly above their study mean (population mean = 21.62).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study-frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) — moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.42).  
- Some early-morning nocturnal HR deviations that have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.25–0.31).

Reasons Participant 2 might have lower PSS (countervailing evidence)
- Extremely high self-efficacy (NGSE = 40; Z ≈ +1.79) and very strong negative NGSE–PSS relation (r ≈ −0.60).  
- Minimal generalized anxiety (GAD‑7 = 1.5; Z ≈ −1.38) and GAD–PSS is strongly positive (r ≈ +0.75) — this strongly favors low PSS.  
- Low emotional/interpersonal distress and substance problems (large negative Zs).  
- Very strong circadian regularity and very low resting HR (RHR ≈ 41.9 bpm; Z ≈ −2.23) — objective markers consistent with lower PSS.
Integrated note: the summary judges P2’s profile as clearly below their study mean (population mean = 21.5), with the PSQI as an isolated counter-signal.

Comparative reasoning (explicitly within each study’s mean frame)
- Each description is normalized to its own cohort mean. Participant 1 is characterized as likely slightly above their population mean PSS; Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean PSS.  
- The strongest single risk signals for P1 are moderate (STAI and PSQI), and are balanced by multiple objective resilience markers; net assessment given was “slightly above” the mean.  
- For P2, the dominant psychometric signals strongly favor lower stress (very high NGSE, very low GAD, strong negative correlations and large Z-scores), and objective physiology strongly supports low stress; only subjective sleep is a notable opposing signal. The summary therefore places P2 below the mean more confidently than P1 is placed above theirs.  
- Because both descriptions are relative to different cohort means, we judge based on each participant’s placement relative to their own cohort: P1 ≈ slightly above mean; P2 ≈ below mean. That implies P1 has the higher perceived stress.

4,26800,31,21,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Severe clinical anxiety (GAD‑7 = 18) — this measure has a very strong positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.75), and is the single strongest predictor in the description.
- Markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; late sleep onset ~01:42; short median sleep ≈4h55m) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47).
- Elevated pain and activity interference (PEG‑3 and PAPAS Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) — pain measures correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.39–0.42).
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −1.73) — NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.61), a strong protective factor that is low here.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal (large positive HR deviations 12–5 AM; some night HR windows correlate with PSS) — objective physiological evidence supporting hyperarousal consistent with higher perceived stress.
- Combined effect: multiple large-Z symptom scores and a physiological pathway (nocturnal HR + poor sleep) point coherently above the study mean (population mean PSS = 20.62).
Countervailing (mitigating) evidence is present but modest: above‑average circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, low intradaily fragmentation, and near‑average resting HR — these are associated with lower PSS but with smaller effect sizes than the major symptom signals.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Reduced circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude z ≈ −0.9, interdaily stability z ≈ −0.9) — these are modestly associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Late and variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:28, SD ≈ 89 min) — small positive association with PSS.
- Trait anxiety (STAI‑Trait = 40) — moderate positive correlation with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.31); could elevate perceived stress risk.
- Low frequency of exercise and limited engagement in buffering activities — behavioral factors that can raise vulnerability to stress over time.
Countervailing (protective) evidence is substantial: low resting HR and mesor (z ≈ −1.0), low depressive symptoms (CES‑D z ≈ −0.66), good subjective sleep quality (PSQI z ≈ −0.8), high self‑esteem (RSES z ≈ +0.96), good academic functioning, and elevated 24‑h autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.64). The integrated assessment in the description places this participant near to slightly below their study mean PSS (population mean PSS = 21.62).

Comparative within‑population reasoning
- Participant 1 is explicitly described as above their population mean (20.62) with multiple large-effect symptom predictors (severe anxiety, high PSQI, high pain, low self‑efficacy) and corroborating nocturnal physiological signs; several of these features have strong correlations with PSS (notably anxiety r ≈ 0.75 and NGSE r ≈ −0.61).
- Participant 2 is described as near or slightly below their population mean (21.62). Their risk signals (circadian disruption, late sleep, moderate trait anxiety) are present but of smaller effect size and are counterbalanced by several fairly strong protective indicators (low resting HR, low depressive symptoms, good sleep quality, high self‑esteem).
- Effect‑size and coherence favor Participant 1: their profile contains multiple large, converging indicators of elevated perceived stress (both subjective and physiological) that outweigh their modest protective circadian regularity. Participant 2’s vulnerabilities are weaker and more mixed and are offset by several robust protective markers.

- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; classified as ""Disturbed Sleep"") — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.53).
- Very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep onset (high SDs, positive z-scores). Short, irregular sleep is a strong, proximal correlate of elevated perceived stress.
- Reduced circadian regularity and blunted rhythm amplitude (low interdaily stability, low 24-h autocorrelation, reduced cosinor amplitude) which are commonly associated with stress-related dysregulation.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 Interpersonal Relationships z = 2.34), a salient contextual source of ongoing perceived stress for many people.
- Evening heart-rate elevations and dampened circadian HR amplitude consistent with irregular daily schedule or physiological dysregulation that often co-occurs with higher stress.

Reasons in Participant 1’s profile that argue against high PSS
- Minimal current anxiety (GAD-7 very low), low pain and pain interference, and low emotional lability — all reduce the likelihood of very high concurrent perceived stress.
- Self-efficacy near the sample mean (a protective factor strongly linked to lower PSS in this sample).
- Low resting HR and MESOR (arguing for lower tonic physiological arousal).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 43), which correlates positively with PSS in the sample (~0.31).
- Slightly higher-than-average alcohol use (1–2×/week; z ≈ 1.0), which can be associated with stress in some individuals.
- Modest reductions in circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation negative z-scores) and some daytime HR elevations that can reflect greater daytime cardiovascular demand.

- Generally good subjective sleep (PSQI = 5) and adequate objective sleep duration (≈7.5 h) with low night-to-night variability and consistent sleep timing — all protective against high perceived stress.
- Low depressive symptoms, above-average happiness and health satisfaction.
- Regular exercise and minimal recreational drug use (behavioral resilience factors).
- Low resting HR and low mesor (Z ≈ -1.30 and -1.79) indicating good cardiovascular fitness/low baseline arousal — usually associated with lower perceived stress.

Comparative reasoning within each population frame
- Both descriptions explicitly characterize the participant as near their study’s PSS mean, but Participant 1’s summary notes a “modest tilt toward being above the mean,” driven primarily by severe and highly irregular sleep and notable interpersonal strain. Those factors are strongly relevant to perceived stress in this dataset (especially sleep).
- Participant 2’s profile has a small set of risk indicators (trait anxiety, alcohol use, modest circadian irregularity) but a stronger set of protective signals (good sleep, exercise, low depressive symptoms, low resting HR). The overall balance for Participant 2 is toward resilience and near-mean PSS with only modest vulnerability.
- Considering the strength and proximal relevance of sleep disturbance and interpersonal strain for PSS (Participant 1) versus the predominance of protective factors and more modest risk indicators for Participant 2, the weight of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have the higher perceived stress relative to their respective study mean.

22,89161,10,19,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ +0.83) — PSQI has a substantial sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a strong upward predictor.
- Wearable sleep signals consistent with sleep problems: median recorded sleep very short (1 h 44 min, Z ≈ -1.24) and high night-to-night start-time variability (~160 min SD). Even accounting for possible non-wear, these objective signals align with the high PSQI and support higher perceived stress.
- Pain and interference: PEG-3 (7.78, Z ≈ +0.71) and PAPAS (Z ≈ +0.8) are elevated and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.52–0.56), which would push inferred PSS upward.
- Some nocturnal physiological arousal: small–moderate positive hourly HR deviations overnight that correlate with PSS (up to r ≈ 0.42) — consistent with stress-linked nocturnal arousal.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population mean)
- Circadian fragmentation: elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.3), which has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16).
- Reduced interdaily regularity: slightly below-average interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation (small negative z-scores), suggesting less day-to-day regularity linked in-sample to higher PSS.
- Late habitual sleep onset (~01:56 AM) and some late-evening HR elevations (e.g., 10–11 PM), which can be associated with evening arousal and higher stress for some people.
- Frequent recreational drug use (≈1–2×/week; Z ≈ +5.44) — although the report notes its direct correlation with PSS in the sample is small, it is an outlying behavior that can reflect coping/stress-related lifestyle factors in some contexts.

Comparative, within-population-frame weighing of evidence
- Participant 1: The summary explicitly places this person near the sample mean PSS with a modest upward shift driven mainly by sleep disturbance and pain/interference. Those predictors have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.58; pain r ≈ 0.52–0.56), so the upward influence is substantive even though other robust protective factors (very low GAD-7, higher self-efficacy, regular circadian markers, low resting HR) push downwards.
- Participant 2: The summary explicitly places this person below their sample mean PSS. Most strong signals are protective (low CES-D and STAI-Trait; high happiness, self-esteem; adequate/regular sleep duration; low resting HR). The risk signals (intradaily variability, late sleep timing, late-evening HR, recreational drug use) are present but are either modestly correlated with PSS in-sample or noted as context-dependent; overall they are outweighed by multiple stronger protective indicators.
- Because each profile is given relative to its own population mean, the relevant comparison is that Participant 1 is characterized as near-to-slightly-above their population mean, whereas Participant 2 is characterized as below their population mean. The magnitude and strength of risk indicators pushing P1 upward (notably high PSQI and elevated pain scores with moderate-to-strong correlations to PSS) are more convincing than the circadian/behavioral risks for P2, which are described as modest and context-dependent and are counterbalanced by multiple strong protective signals.

Decision
- Participant 1 more likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress (higher PSS relative to their population mean) than Participant 2.

- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI), which correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31).
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52) plus late and variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:00, start-time SD Z ≈ +1.36).
- Objective circadian disruption: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.15), very low 24‑hr autocorrelation (Z ≈ −1.87), high intradaily variability (Z ≈ +1.44) — pattern linked to stress-related outcomes.
- Elevated mean cardiac level (MESOR Z ≈ +1.56) and higher resting HR (Z ≈ +1.34), both modestly positively correlated with PSS.
- Multiple moderately strong indicators point above the study mean despite some protective factors.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high anxiety (GAD‑7 Z = +2.04, “severe”), and in this sample GAD‑7 has a strong positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.71).
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.49) and extreme objective sleep restriction (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 42 min with large night-to-night variability), both strongly tied to elevated perceived stress.
- High pain and interference (PEG‑3 / PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28) and pronounced emotional lability (BASIS‑24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42) — large Zs that typically accompany high perceived stress.
- Low general self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ −2.29), a trait that amplifies perceived stress.
- Wearable markers consistent with circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.15) and nocturnal HR deviations at sleep onset that correlate moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), indicating nocturnal physiological arousal linked to stress/insomnia.
- Although there are some protective signs (low substance problems, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR suggesting fitness), the number, magnitude, and PSS‑relevance of risk signals are large.

Comparative, within‑population reasoning
- Both participants are described as above their respective study means, but the strength and number of risk indicators differ.
- Participant 1’s elevated signals are mainly moderate (several Zs around +1.3 to +1.6) and include both psychological (depression, anxiety) and physiological (higher MESOR/HR, circadian fragmentation) features. Protective factors (good GPA, low substance use, preserved self‑esteem) moderate the interpretation.
- Participant 2 exhibits several very large, high‑relevance signals (GAD‑7 Z ≈ +2.04; emotional lability Z ≈ +2.42; pain Z ≈ +2.28; NGSE Z ≈ −2.29) and extreme objective sleep restriction (≈3.7 h/night) with night‑time physiological arousal patterns that are moderately correlated with PSS. The strongest single predictor in the sample (GAD‑7, r ≈ 0.71) is highly elevated for Participant 2.
- Overall, Participant 2’s risk profile is more severe in magnitude (multiple Zs > |2|), affects more domains (severe anxiety, emotional instability, pain, very short sleep, low self‑efficacy), and includes measures that have stronger sample correlations with PSS than many of Participant 1’s elevated measures.

Weighting the balance of evidence, Participant 2 more likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

9,98117,12,22,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s sample frame)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) — PSQI moderately correlates with PSS in this sample (r = 0.46).
- Very short objective sleep duration (median nightly sleep ~3 h 27 min; Z ≈ -0.66) and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 197 min; Z ≈ +0.62) — objective sleep restriction/variability are plausibly stress-amplifying.
- Elevated intradaily variability in circadian rhythm (value = 0.64; Z = +2.29), which in the sample trends toward higher PSS (r ≈ 0.24).
- Some interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal relationships Z ≈ +0.94), which could add psychosocial stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s sample frame)
- Markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33; Z ≈ +2.05) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +1.16); both positively correlated with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8) combined with extreme sleep timing irregularity (median sleep start 04:03; sleep start SD Z ≈ +4.33) and very high sleep-duration variability (SD Z ≈ +3.02); these large deviations are associated with higher PSS.
- Low daytime social engagement (Z ≈ −2.20), high recreational internet use (Z ≈ +2.19), and minimal exercise — behavioral patterns associated with worse mood/stress.
- Physiological signs consistent with elevated stress: modestly elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ +0.98 each) and slightly reduced HR amplitude (compatible with higher PSS).

Comparative reasoning (within each population frame)
- Both participants are described relative to very similar population mean PSS scores (21.42 vs 21.61), so comparisons are essentially within comparable reference frames.
- Participant 1’s highest-risk signals are primarily sleep-related (severe objective sleep restriction, disturbed PSQI, high intradaily variability). However, the strongest sample-level predictors of PSS (GAD-7 anxiety, NGSE self-efficacy, and emotional lability) point clearly toward lower perceived stress for Participant 1. Crucially, GAD-7 and NGSE have strong correlations with PSS in this sample (r = 0.76 and r = -0.65), making their indications highly influential.
- Participant 2 shows a coherent cluster of large, converging risk signals: clinically elevated depressive symptoms (large Z), elevated trait anxiety, substantial sleep-timing and duration irregularity (very large Zs), reduced social engagement, and physiological indicators modestly consistent with stress. Several of these deviations are large (multiple Z > +2 or near) and align with measures that correlate positively with PSS.
- The magnitude and number of elevated indicators in Participant 2 (especially large Z-scores on depression and sleep irregularity plus multiple supporting behavioral/physiological signals) outweigh the sleep-only dominant but mixed profile in Participant 1, particularly because Participant 1’s most predictive measures (low anxiety, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) are strongly associated with lower PSS in that sample.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 2 most likely has higher perceived stress relative to their population mean. Participant 1’s record is mixed but leans below their population mean PSS due to very strong signals of low anxiety and high self-efficacy despite severe sleep problems.

{""higher_pss"": ""Participant_2""}",9,Pain,12,98117,NetHealth,22
3,39146,13,25,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10.5). In this sample PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47), so this is a plausible stress-related risk factor.
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3, PAPAS) above the sample median; these measures correlate moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 1.54) which may reduce perceived social support.
- Elevated resting HR and mesor (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22) that could reflect increased basal autonomic arousal (though physiological correlations with PSS are weak).
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5), though the score is low and below clinical thresholds.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (RHR Z = 0.86; mesor Z = 0.61) indicating modest physiological arousal.
- Higher intradaily variability (Z = 0.53), which correlates positively with PSS (≈ 0.16).
- Late sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:32) and somewhat short sleep duration (6 h 48 min, Z ≈ -0.47), both linked to higher stress in many studies.
- Lower momentary happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), suggesting some affective strain.
- Daytime elevations in heart rate (augmented daytime autonomic tone) that may reflect higher allostatic load despite preserved nocturnal recovery.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Both descriptions conclude the participant’s inferred PSS is near their respective population mean with a modest bias toward below-mean. The question is which one is relatively worse (higher) within their own sample.
- Key predictive relationships mentioned: in Participant 1’s sample, NGSE (self-efficacy) has a strong inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.63), and GAD-7 correlates strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.77). Participant 1 has a high NGSE (Z = 1.41) and only mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5.5), both strong signals toward lower PSS.
- Participant 1 also shows exceptionally strong circadian/behavioral regularity (interdaily stability Z = 2.13, autocorrelation Z = 1.57, low intradaily variability Z = -1.05), which are protective and unusually pronounced.
- Participant 2 has some modest objective risk markers (RHR, intradaily variability, late/short sleep) and some psychosocial buffers (RSES Z = 0.68, good PSQI Z = -0.8, strong 24-h autocorrelation Z = 1.15). However, Participant 2’s psychosocial protections are generally smaller in magnitude than Participant 1’s strongest protective signals (NGSE Z = 1.41; circadian stability Zs).
- Physiological elevations (RHR/mesor) in both participants are present, but these metrics show weak correlations with PSS in the samples, so they are less influential than the strong NGSE and GAD signals described for Participant 1.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: several moderate risk factors (subjective sleep disturbance, pain, interpersonal strain) but very strong protective factors that are highly predictive of lower PSS in that sample (high NGSE, exceptional circadian regularity, low emotional lability).
- Participant 2: a mix of modest physiological/behavioral risk signals (elevated RHR, intradaily variability, late/short sleep) and moderate psychosocial protections; overall protections are less pronounced than Participant 1’s strongest protections.
- Given the very large protective signals in Participant 1 that align with the strongest predictive correlations in that dataset (especially NGSE), and given Participant 2’s combination of objective arousal and less-dominant psychosocial buffers, the evidence favors Participant 2 as having the relatively higher perceived stress (i.e., being worse off) within their respective sample contexts.

21,14279,30,20,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 1’s study frame)
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 12) — high correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.77). This is the single strongest predictor in the summary.
- Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 17.5; z = 1.32) — moderately correlated with PSS and a large deviation from the sample.
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: several overnight hourly HR deviations substantially above the sample mean (e.g., +11.9 bpm around midnight; z ≈ 1.02) and these nocturnal deviations positively correlate with PSS.
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a strong negative correlation to PSS (≈ -0.66), consistent with higher perceived stress vulnerability.
- Elevated substance-abuse subscale (z ≈ 1.5) indicating behavioral risk that could be stress-related (even if its direct correlation with PSS is small).
- Holistic judgment in the summary: multiple high-impact psychological and physiological indicators lead to an inference of above-mean PSS for this participant.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within Participant 2’s study frame)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) — clinically elevated and commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated intradaily variability (IV z ≈ 0.53) indicating within-day fragmentation that correlates positively with PSS.
- Slightly reduced momentary happiness and very low trust (happiness z ≈ -0.53; trust z ≈ -1.74) — features that can co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Small early-morning HR deviations that correlate weakly with PSS in this sample.
- Note: these stress-relevant signals are present but generally smaller in magnitude and/or counterbalanced by many strong indicators of low stress.

Comparative, within-frame reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study’s mean PSS. Participant 1 is explicitly described as above their study mean (population mean = 20.67); Participant 2 is described as below their study mean (population mean = 21.62).
- Magnitude and weight of indicators: Participant 1 shows several moderately-to-strongly deviant, stress-linked features (notably very high PSQI z = 1.32, meaningful GAD-7 with a large correlation to PSS, and substantial nocturnal HR elevations). Participant 2’s stress-linked features (PSQI = 7, IV z ≈ 0.53, lower momentary happiness) are milder and are outweighed in their summary by multiple robust protective signals (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, long/regular objective sleep, strong circadian amplitude).
- Even allowing for the slight difference in population mean PSS values (Participant 2’s sample mean ≈ 0.95 points higher), the within-sample evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to be above their mean and by a clinically meaningful pattern, whereas Participant 2 is likely below theirs.

Balance of evidence and decision
- The preponderance and magnitudes of stress-associated symptoms and physiology are greater for Participant 1 than for Participant 2 (relative to each cohort). Therefore Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher overall perceived stress.

- Elevated anxiety and affective instability: GAD‑7 = 9.0 (mild anxiety) with very strong correlation to PSS in the sample (r = 0.78); BASIS‑24 emotional lability elevated (r = 0.68). These are highly PSS‑relevant and point upward.
- Substance‑related problems and pain interference: BASIS‑24 substance abuse Z = 1.75 and pain measures that correlate positively with PSS, adding psychosocial strain.
- Circadian/rhythm instability: Reduced interdaily stability, low amplitude, low 24‑hr autocorrelation (several Zs < 0) consistent with blunted, irregular rhythms that associate with higher stress.
- Net weight of measures: Multiple high‑PSS‑correlated variables point in the same direction and several are extreme (notably sleep), outweighing protective signals.
Protective/offsetting factors (that reduce but do not negate the above): very high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = 1.79), lower resting HR/mesor (Z ≈ -0.6), some wearable metrics near mean.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Objective sleep and circadian strain: Short median sleep (5 h 46 min; Z = -1.76), very late sleep timing (~02:39 AM), reduced circadian amplitude (Z = -1.15), modestly elevated intradaily variability. These physiology/timing metrics are associated with higher perceived stress.
- Elevated resting HR and mesor: Resting HR 67.7 bpm (Z = 1.14) and MESOR Z = 1.14, which weakly correlate with PSS in the sample and suggest some physiological activation.
- Net weight of measures: Several wearable/circadian indicators push toward higher physiological stress, though effect sizes/correlations with PSS are modest.
Protective/offsetting factors (strong and numerous): very low depressive symptoms (CES‑D 3.0), low trait anxiety (STAI = 28), high self‑esteem, high happiness and health satisfaction, minimal substance use, frequent social exercise, good academic performance — all robustly associated with lower perceived stress in this sample.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Participant 1 is explicitly inferred to be above their study population mean (mean PSS = 21.33). The key variables that drive that inference (PSQI, GAD‑7, emotional lability, substance problems, extreme objective sleep disruption) have strong correlations with PSS in that study and include several large Z‑scores (e.g., sleep timing variability Z = 2.82; substance Z = 1.75).
- Participant 2 is inferred to be near their study population mean (mean PSS = 21.61). The objective indicators that would push P2 above the mean are moderate in magnitude (sleep duration Z = -1.76; amplitude Z = -1.15; resting HR Z = 1.14) and have relatively small correlations with PSS, while a cluster of robust self‑report measures strongly point toward below‑average distress.
- Relative severity and converging evidence: Participant 1 shows multiple, convergent indicators that are both strongly PSS‑correlated and extreme (notably the ~3‑hour median sleep and large sleep timing variability). Participant 2’s higher‑stress signals are primarily physiological/timing and of more moderate magnitude and are counterbalanced by strong subjective resilience across several validated scales.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- The overall balance favors Participant 1 as exhibiting worse perceived stress. P1 presents a stronger, more convergent set of high‑PSS predictors (severe/irregular sleep, anxiety/emotional lability, substance problems) with larger effect sizes/Zs and stronger sample correlations than the primarily physiologic and more moderate signals seen in P2, which are offset by robustly low self‑reported distress.

- Elevated internalizing symptoms: CES‑D = 27 (z ≈ +1.42, “Depressed”) and STAI‑Trait = 48 (z ≈ +0.66). Both scales correlate positively with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so these elevations point toward above‑mean perceived stress.
- Disturbed sleep (subjective) and irregular sleep timing: PSQI = 8 (z ≈ +0.59), very late median sleep onset (~01:19) and large night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD ≈ 113 min). These sleep disturbances are associated with higher PSS.
- Marked circadian dysregulation and evening physiological arousal: circadian amplitude z ≈ -1.48 and interdaily stability z ≈ -1.40 (reduced rhythmicity), plus large evening HR deviation (8–9pm mean deviation z ≈ +1.85). These features are consistent with increased stress signals in this cohort.
- Behavioral correlates of strain: increased naps (z ≈ +2.27), reduced restorative leisure, elevated internet use—patterns often co‑occurring with higher perceived stress.

Protective/mitigating signals (weighing against very high PSS): normal resting HR, healthy BMI, adequate average sleep duration (~7 h), intact academic performance, modest substance use and some socializing—these reduce but do not eliminate the weight of the above indicators.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study mean = 21.21)
- Severe objective and subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 11.5 (strongly correlated with PSS, r ≈ 0.48) and median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 30 min with very late sleep onset (~03:37). This is a large, salient abnormality strongly linked to perceived stress.
- Elevated pain/interference: PEG‑3 z ≈ +1.33 (and PAPAS z ≈ +0.43), with pain measures showing moderate (~0.5) correlations with PSS—this supports higher perceived stress tied to bodily symptoms and activity disruption.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal and attenuated rhythm robustness: nighttime HR elevations (late night–early morning z up to ~0.67) and reduced circadian amplitude/autocorrelation—these wearable signals align with higher PSS in the sample.
- The study summary explicitly interprets this pattern as above the cohort mean because the sleep, pain, and nocturnal arousal signals have moderate‑to‑strong sample correlations with PSS.

Protective/mitigating signals (weighing against very high PSS): notably low GAD‑7 (4.5; z ≈ -0.85) — and GAD‑7 correlates very strongly with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77), so low anxiety is a substantial indicator of lower perceived stress. High self‑efficacy (NGSE z ≈ +0.86, r ≈ -0.64 with PSS) and low emotional lability (z ≈ -0.97) are also strong buffers.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Both participants are assessed as “above the population mean” in their respective studies. We must judge which profile likely maps to a higher absolute perceived‑stress level relative to their own sample frames.
- Participant 1’s strongest signals are elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D z +1.42), some trait anxiety (z +0.66), clear circadian disruption (amplitude and interdaily stability z ≈ -1.4 to -1.5), and a large evening HR elevation (z ≈ +1.85). However, the strongest self‑report scales that predict PSS in this cohort have only modest correlations (CES‑D/STAI r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and several protective factors (normal resting HR, ~7 h average sleep, good functioning) temper the inference.
- Participant 2’s most striking abnormalities are extremely short objective sleep (median ~3.5 h), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI 11.5), elevated pain (PEG‑3 z ≈ +1.33), and nocturnal HR elevation. Those features each have moderate‑to‑strong sample correlations with PSS (PSQI r ≈ 0.48; pain ≈ 0.5; nocturnal HR r up to ≈ 0.43). These risk indicators are large in magnitude and directly tied to PSS in the sample. Important counterweights for P2 are low GAD‑7 and high self‑efficacy (both quite predictive of lower PSS in the cohort), which reduce certainty that P2’s PSS is extremely high.
- Net comparison: P1 shows clinically elevated depression and substantial circadian/ evening‑arousal abnormalities but also normal average sleep duration and functional protective signals. P2 shows extraordinarily severe objective sleep restriction plus pain and nocturnal arousal—large, direct stress‑relevant abnormalities—despite strong protective self‑efficacy and low generalized anxiety.

Weighing evidence
- The severity and directness of P2’s sleep deprivation and pain (both with moderate‑to‑strong links to PSS) are compelling indicators of high perceived stress relative to that study’s population. Although P2’s low GAD‑7 and high self‑efficacy are important buffers, they do not fully negate the likely stress burden implied by chronic extreme short sleep and pain interference.
- Participant 1’s elevated depressive symptoms and circadian irregularities indicate above‑mean stress but, given the more modest PSS correlations for those particular self‑reports in this sample and several functional/protective signs, the overall inferred PSS burden seems somewhat less extreme than the very large sleep/pain abnormalities observed for Participant 2.

- Very high clinical anxiety (GAD‑7 = 16.5; Z = +1.25) — in this study GAD‑7 has a very strong positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.81), so this is a high‑weight indicator of above‑mean perceived stress.
- Markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16; Z = +0.83) — PSQI is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r = 0.51), supporting elevated stress.
- Low generalized self‑efficacy (NGSE Z = −0.62) — NGSE is strongly inversely correlated with PSS (r = −0.66), adding substantial risk for higher perceived stress.
- Pain/interference (PEG/PAPAS moderate; correlations ~0.44–0.48) — additional psychosocial burden associated with higher PSS.
- Elevated baseline physiological arousal (resting HR Z ≈ +1.53; mesor Z ≈ +1.49) — consistent with sustained stress‑related arousal.
- Objective sleep pattern concerning (very short median wearable sleep, late/irregular sleep timing; sleep start SD Z ≈ +0.98) — aligns with subjective sleep complaints and stress.
- Although some circadian regularity and low intradaily fragmentation are present (protective signs), they are comparatively modest and do not outweigh the strong psychological and physiological indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52; Z = +1.06) — a contributor to higher PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.31).
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 17; Z = +0.38) — modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.28).
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; Z = +1.05) and objectively short/late sleep (median ≈ 5 h 58 min; Z ≈ −1.52) — consistent with stress-related sleep disturbance.
- Circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.46; 24‑h autocorr Z ≈ −0.19) and pronounced evening HR deviations (evening HR deviation Z ≈ +1.69) — physiological signs that correlate moderately with PSS in this sample.
- These signals are tempered by several protective/mitigating factors (frequent exercise Z ≈ +1.07, high interpersonal trust Z ≈ +1.79, good self‑rated health Z ≈ +1.30, low substance use), which reduce the net inferred stress burden compared with someone showing only risk signs.

Comparative, within‑sample reasoning
- Both participants are judged above their respective study means in the provided syntheses. To decide which is likely higher in absolute perceived stress, we must consider (a) strength of the risk indicators given their cohort correlations, (b) magnitude of deviations (Z scores) within each cohort, and (c) presence of strong mitigating factors.
- Participant 1 shows very strong, high‑weight indicators tied to PSS in that study: severe GAD‑7 (highly predictive in that sample, r = 0.81), very poor subjective sleep (PSQI; r = 0.51), low self‑efficacy (r = −0.66), and elevated resting HR/mesor (Zs ≈ +1.5). Those measures are among the most strongly correlated with PSS in Participant 1’s dataset, so even moderate Zs on those measures translate into substantial inferred PSS elevation relative to that cohort mean.
- Participant 2 also shows multiple risk indicators (elevated STAI, CES‑D, PSQI, short/late sleep, circadian fragmentation and evening HR deviations). However, the psychological measures in Participant 2’s study have smaller correlations with PSS (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES‑D r ≈ 0.28) than the top predictors in Participant 1’s study. In addition, Participant 2 has several notable protective behaviors/resources (frequent exercise, high interpersonal trust, good self‑rated health) that blunt the net risk.
- Magnitude comparison of strongest signals: Participant 1’s severe anxiety and elevated physiological arousal (Zs ≈ +1.25 to +1.53 on highly PSS‑correlated measures) constitute a heavier weight toward higher perceived stress than Participant 2’s strongest signals (STAI Z ≈ +1.06, PSQI Z ≈ +1.05, evening HR deviation Z ≈ +1.69 but on physiological features with smaller PSS correlations), especially given Participant 2’s stronger set of protective factors.

Balance of evidence and decision
- Overall, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to have the worse (higher) perceived stress. Participant 1’s profile contains multiple high‑weight, strongly PSS‑correlated indicators (severe GAD, very poor PSQI, low self‑efficacy, elevated resting HR/mesor, pain interference) that together outweigh Participant 2’s mixed risk/protective profile.

- Direct inference in the summary: the profile is explicitly characterized as “likely above the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.17).”  
- Strong anxiety signal: GAD‑7 = 14.5 (Z = 0.9) — moderate-to-high anxiety — and GAD‑7 is strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.80).  
- Severe subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep) and PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.49).  
- Extreme objective sleep deprivation/irregularity: median nightly sleep ≈ 2 h 19 min (Z ≈ -1.04), very late/variable sleep onset (start-time SD Z = 1.16). These objective sleep deficits are strongly consistent with elevated perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated resting HR (81.23 bpm, Z = 1.67), flattened circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability (Z’s ≈ -1.34 and 1.23), and marked night-time HR elevations (+8–9 bpm at 12–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42). These collectively indicate nighttime arousal and rhythm disruption tied to higher PSS.  
- Elevated emotional lability and pain/interference (BASIS-24, PEG-3/PAPAS) that correlate positively with PSS.  
- Although there is a modestly higher self-efficacy (a protective factor), most of the strongest signals associated with PSS (anxiety, severe sleep disruption, nocturnal arousal) point toward higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Modest elevations in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: STAI = 44 (Z = 0.27) and CES‑D = 15 (Z = 0.18); both positively correlated with PSS in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28).  
- Subjective sleep complaints: PSQI = 6 (above clinical cutpoint), along with late median sleep start (~00:57) and moderate night-to-night timing variability (SD ≈ 63 min). Subjective sleep disturbance tends to associate with higher PSS.  
- Some circadian irregularity: interdaily stability below mean (Z ≈ -0.74) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.32); small positive correlations between some early-morning HR deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21).  
- Slight reductions in recent happiness and health satisfaction (small negative Z’s) that can co-occur with higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Magnitude and strength of risk signals: Participant 1 shows multiple large-magnitude, convergent risk indicators that are strongly tied to PSS in that sample (notably GAD‑7 with r ≈ 0.80, extreme objective sleep loss, nocturnal HR elevations, large circadian disruption Z-scores). Participant 2 shows only mild-to-moderate risk signals (small Z’s for anxiety/depression, PSQI = 6) with correspondingly smaller correlations to PSS.  
- Protective factors: Participant 2 has several robust protective signals (high self‑esteem Z = 1.38, frequent exercise Z > 1, good objective sleep duration Z = 0.56, low resting HR) that should lower their PSS relative to their sample. Participant 1 has only a modest protective factor (self‑efficacy Z = 0.12) that is unlikely to offset the many strong stress-linked signals.  
- Objective sleep/physiology contrast: Participant 1’s objective sleep is extremely short and physiologically aroused at night (strong indicators of high stress). Participant 2’s objective sleep quantity is sufficient and resting physiology is healthier (low resting HR), suggesting lower physiological burden despite subjective complaints.  
- Correlational relevance: Several of Participant 1’s elevated measures have stronger sample-level correlations with PSS (e.g., GAD‑7 r ≈ 0.80; PSQI r ≈ 0.49) than do Participant 2’s elevated measures (STAI/CES‑D r’s ≈ 0.28–0.31), increasing confidence that Participant 1’s markers reflect higher perceived stress within their cohort.

Overall judgment
- The balance of evidence indicates Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit a higher PSS (worse perceived stress) relative to their study population than Participant 2 is relative to theirs. Participant 1’s profile contains multiple, convergent, and relatively large-magnitude indicators that are strongly associated with PSS in that sample (especially moderate-to-high anxiety, severe objective sleep loss and nocturnal physiological arousal, and circadian disruption). Participant 2’s risk indicators are smaller in magnitude and substantially offset by several strong protective factors, producing an overall inference near (or only slightly above) their sample mean.

13,33009,28,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean of 21.62)
- Wearable circadian/physiology markers consistent with stress: elevated intradaily variability (Z = +0.53), reduced interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.45), and low circadian amplitude (Z = -0.92). In this dataset these features correlate with higher PSS (amplitude r ≈ -0.17; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (clinically disturbed sleep), a measure commonly associated with higher PSS.  
- Elevated trait anxiety and reduced current happiness (STAI = 40; happiness Z = -0.53) which align with greater psychological strain.  
- The study-level inference explicitly states the participant is likely modestly above their population mean (above 21.62), though not extreme.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population mean of 20.75)
- Strong self-report indicators highly predictive of PSS in this dataset: mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5; GAD-7 r = 0.80 with PSS), emotional lability (r = 0.67), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; PSQI r = 0.59).  
- Pain and functional interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55), which correlate positively with PSS (PEG r = 0.47; PAPAS r = 0.50).  
- Nocturnal heart-rate deviations at specific hours that are positively associated with PSS (e.g., 1–2am r = 0.45), consistent with stress-linked autonomic arousal.  
- The integrative statement explicitly infers P2 is likely above their population mean (above 20.75), driven mainly by high-weight survey predictors.

Comparative reasoning within each study-frame
- Strength of predictors: Participant 2’s main risk signals are survey-based measures that have very large correlations with PSS in their dataset (notably GAD-7 r = 0.80 and emotional lability r = 0.67), meaning those elevations are highly informative of higher perceived stress within that population. Participant 1’s strongest objective signals (circadian fragmentation/low amplitude) have much smaller correlations with PSS in their dataset (r values ~0.16–0.17), so while they point toward increased stress, they are weaker predictors.  
- Magnitude and number of adverse signals: P2 shows multiple strong self-report burdens (anxiety, emotional lability, poor PSQI, pain interference) that are each substantially associated with higher PSS. P1 has a mixed profile: some objective circadian signs and PSQI > 5 indicate higher stress, but several protective/mitigating factors (ample objective sleep duration, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, healthy behaviors) argue against a large elevation.  
- Explicit inferences in each profile: Both summaries infer each participant is above their respective sample mean, but P1 is described as “modestly elevated… within about one SD,” whereas P2 is characterized as above mean with multiple high-weight self-report predictors that likely produce a stronger elevation relative to their peers.

Overall judgment
- Given the stronger, higher-weighted self-report predictors and multiple corroborating adverse indicators in Participant 2 (and the relatively weaker effect-size signals and substantial protective factors in Participant 1), Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress relative to their study population.

- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86), which correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52) and objectively short, late sleep (median ~6h14m, Z = -1.17; sleep onset ~02:02), both linked to higher perceived stress.  
- High variability in sleep duration and some inconsistency in sleep timing, which is often associated with greater stress.  
- Modestly reduced social/leisure engagement and slightly lower self-esteem (Rosenberg Z = -0.31), which can reduce stress-buffering resources.  
Countervailing/mitigating factors for Participant 1: substantially low resting HR and mesor (RHR Z = -1.41; mesor Z = -1.20), preserved circadian regularity, strong academic functioning and modestly higher current happiness — all of which tend to predict lower PSS or mitigate stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very elevated generalized anxiety (GAD-7 = 18, Z = 1.51) and a strong correlation with PSS in this sample (r = 0.74) — the single strongest predictor reported.  
- Severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 18.5, Z = 1.65; PSQI–PSS r = 0.43).  
- High emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z = 1.03; r with PSS = 0.63), and elevated pain/functional interference (PEG-3, PAPAS), all positively associated with PSS.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.44), with a strong negative correlation to PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.66), suggesting reduced coping resources.  
Countervailing/mitigating factors for Participant 2: relatively robust wearable-derived circadian structure (interdaily stability Z = 0.65, intradaily variability Z = -0.59), lower resting HR and mesor (RHR Z ≈ -0.9, mesor Z ≈ -1.35), and preserved amplitude — physiological features that tend to be associated with lower PSS but, in this case, appear weaker predictors than the strong subjective signals.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Strength and predictive weight of subjective signals: Participant 2’s subjective risk indicators are both larger in magnitude (higher Z for PSQI) and tied to stronger correlations with PSS (notably GAD-7 r = 0.74; BASIS-24 r = 0.63; NGSE r = -0.66). Participant 1’s principal subjective risks (STAI Z = 0.86; PSQI Z = 1.52) have smaller effect-size correlations with PSS in that cohort (STAI r ≈ 0.31).  
- Breadth of adverse indicators: Participant 2 shows multiple high-impact subjective elevations (severe anxiety, very poor sleep, emotional lability, pain interference, lower self-efficacy) that converge on higher PSS. Participant 1 has two primary subjective risk domains (trait anxiety and poor subjective sleep) plus modest behavioral signals; several strong physiological and functional buffers are present.  
- Objective physiology: Both participants show some physiological markers consistent with lower PSS (low resting HR, preserved circadian metrics), but these objective features are described as less predictive of PSS than the strong subjective symptoms in Participant 2. For Participant 1, the physiological buffering is especially pronounced (very low RHR, strong functional markers), making an above-mean PSS less pronounced.  
- Relative elevation vs. population means: Both are characterized as above their respective population means, but Participant 2’s above-mean status is supported by higher-magnitude subjective z-scores and larger PSS-correlations, implying a larger departure from their cohort mean in terms of stress-related predictors.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Because Participant 2 has multiple, large-magnitude subjective risk indicators that are strongly correlated with PSS (especially GAD-7 with r = 0.74 and severe PSQI), and these converge more strongly than the signals for Participant 1, the overall evidence indicates Participant 2 is likely experiencing the higher perceived stress relative to their cohort mean. Participant 1 is above their mean but shows stronger physiological and functional buffers that attenuate the likely magnitude of elevation.

15,49497,15,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 15.5 (Z ≈ +0.67) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.53) in this sample, so elevated PSQI supports higher perceived stress.
- Elevated pain/functional interference: PAPAS = 81 (Z ≈ +0.93) — PAPAS also correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.53), so this is a strong stress-related signal.
- Lower self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -0.62; NGSE correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.69), so reduced self-efficacy predicts higher PSS.
- Elevated heart-rate metrics: mesor and resting HR Zs ≈ +0.61–0.70, and substantial nocturnal HR deviations (Zs up to ≈ +1.38) — these physiological markers are positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31–0.47) in the sample.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.83) indicating irregular daily timing; small association with PSS but directionally consistent with higher stress.

Mitigating/contrary features for Participant 1
- Low-to-mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 5, Z ≈ -0.76); anxiety strongly correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.76), so this is a substantial downward pressure on PSS.
- Relatively long median nightly sleep (≈8h, Z ≈ +0.92) and low nap frequency (Z ≈ -0.56), which can be protective.
- Low intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ -1.28) and slightly lower emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.37) — these modestly temper the risk.

Net: multiple moderate stress-related signals (sleep quality, pain, self-efficacy, nocturnal HR) point to PSS above the sample mean, but some sizable mitigating signals (notably low GAD-7 and long sleep) suggest the elevation is likely moderate rather than extreme.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample)
- Very high depressive symptoms: CES-D = 49 (Z ≈ +3.7). CES-D correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28). The magnitude of this deviation is very large and strongly favors higher PSS.
- High trait anxiety: STAI = 64 (Z ≈ +2.2); STAI correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Large positive z-score is a strong predictor of elevated PSS.
- Poor subjective sleep and short duration: PSQI Z ≈ +1.05 and median sleep ≈6.5 h (Z ≈ -0.85), both associated with higher PSS.
- Strong sleep-timing irregularity and circadian disruption: sleep start SD Z ≈ +2.65, interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.65, amplitude Z ≈ -1.56, and elevated intradaily variability — these all point to circadian fragmentation that is associated (modestly) with higher PSS.
- High recreational/non-prescribed drug use (very large z-scores) and low happiness/trust (z ≈ -1.6, -1.4) — behavioral/social risk factors that align with higher perceived stress.

Mitigating/contrary features for Participant 2
- Regular exercise (Z ≈ +1.07), decent academic functioning (GPA history), and normal resting HR/MESOR (small Zs) — modest buffers against stress.
- Wearable signs show some consolidated daytime activity and not chronically elevated resting HR.

Net: multiple very large self-report deviations (especially CES-D and STAI) plus pronounced circadian/sleep irregularity and substance-use risk provide strong, convergent evidence that P2’s perceived stress is well above their sample mean; mitigating factors are smaller in magnitude and unlikely to offset the large negative indicators.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and final judgment
- Both participants are inferred to be above their respective study means, but the magnitude and number of risk signals differ substantially.
- Participant 1: several moderate-to-strong indicators of higher PSS (sleep quality, pain, self-efficacy, nocturnal HR), but also meaningful protective signals (low GAD-7, long nightly sleep). Overall elevation appears moderate.
- Participant 2: multiple very large, high-magnitude self-report indicators (CES-D Z ≈ +3.7, STAI Z ≈ +2.2), pronounced sleep/timing irregularity (sleep SD Z ≈ +2.65), and large substance-use signals. These are both numerically larger and more numerous than P1’s risk signals; the available buffers are smaller in magnitude.
- Because each profile was assessed relative to its own population mean, the stronger and more extreme deviations in Participant 2 (especially depression and anxiety) imply a higher absolute likelihood of a larger PSS elevation relative to peers than is evident for Participant 1.

- Strong risk indicators
  - Very disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11.5; r with PSS ≈ 0.48) and extremely short objective sleep (median ≈ 3 h 30 min; very large deviation from typical), both strongly associated with higher PSS in the sample.
  - Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 Z = +1.33; PAPAS Z = +0.43), pain measures that correlate moderately with PSS (~0.5).
  - Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (hourly Zs up to ~0.67 late night/early morning), reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.34), and lower 24 h autocorrelation — physiological signals associated with higher PSS.
- Protective/offsetting indicators
  - Low generalized anxiety (GAD-7 Z ≈ -0.85) — a very strong predictor of lower PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77).
  - High self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ +0.86; r with PSS ≈ -0.64) and low emotional lability (Z ≈ -0.97), both meaningfully protective.
  - Resting heart rate and other rhythm metrics near average.
- Net within-sample judgment
  - The description explicitly infers P1 is likely above the population mean PSS (21.21) because of converging, high-impact sleep/pain/nocturnal-arousal signals, but confidence is moderated by very strong protective self-report signals (especially low GAD-7 and high self-efficacy).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (within their study frame)
- Strong risk indicators
  - Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D z ≈ +1.32) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ +1.35); both >1 SD above the mean and positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31).
  - Low happiness and trust (z’s ≈ -1.61 and -2.07), which align with affective distress and higher perceived stress.
  - Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), late median sleep onset (02:38) and large night-to-night variability in timing and duration (sleep SD z ≈ +1.23; sleep start SD z ≈ +0.92), plus high nap frequency (z ≈ +2.27) — irregular sleep/rhythm patterns that relate to higher PSS.
  - Elevated late-evening heart-rate deviations (hourly Zs up to +2.25), indicating physiological activation at times normally used for winding down.
- Protective/offsetting indicators
  - Long objective sleep duration (median ≈ 8 h 6 min; z ≈ +1.14), which may reduce perceived stress despite timing irregularity.
  - Low resting heart rate and mesor (z’s ≈ -1.0), frequent exercise (z ≈ +1.07), above-average social/leisure activity, and good academic functioning — all potential buffers.
- Net within-sample judgment
  - The description explicitly infers P2 is likely above their population mean PSS (21.6), noting particularly that affective measures are >1 SD and multiple circadian/sleep irregularities corroborate elevated perceived stress.

Comparative weighing of evidence (taking within-population frames into account)
- Convergence and magnitude of risk signals:
  - P1: Very large objective sleep pathology (extremely short nightly sleep) plus elevated pain and nocturnal HR — strong, convergent physiological/behavioral risk signals for higher PSS in that sample.
  - P2: Multiple elevated affective measures (depression, trait anxiety) each >1 SD and low positive affect/trust, plus pronounced irregularity in sleep timing and large evening HR deviations — broad, multi-domain affective + circadian risk.
- Strength of predictors (sample correlations noted in descriptions):
  - Some of P1’s protective signals (low GAD-7 and high self-efficacy) are tied to very large sample correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.64), meaning those protective features carry substantial weight in predicting lower PSS.
  - P1’s risk features (sleep, pain, nocturnal HR) have moderate correlations (roughly 0.4–0.5) — important, but somewhat weaker than the GAD-7 predictive weight.
  - P2’s elevated affective measures and sleep/rhythm irregularity each have modest correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31 for CES-D/STAI; circadian/sleep irregularity also implicated). P2’s risk profile is broad and affects core affect domains (depression, trait anxiety, low positive affect), and several of these are >1 SD.
- Net interpretation
  - Participant 1 has very severe sleep deprivation and pain signals that push predicted PSS above their cohort mean, but also has unusually strong protective self-report indicators (especially very low GAD-7 and high self-efficacy) that — given their high predictive weight in this sample — materially reduce the expected PSS.
  - Participant 2 has multiple domains of affective distress that are both broad and sizable (>1 SD) with corroborating behavioral/physiological irregularities; although P2 has several protective physical/behavioral features (long sleep, low RHR, exercise), those protective features are either less specifically weighted toward PSS in the sample or do not fully offset the pronounced affective/distress signals.
  - Overall, the balance of evidence indicates Participant 2’s profile is more consistently and diffusely aligned with higher perceived stress within their cohort, whereas Participant 1’s high-risk physiological signatures are partially counterbalanced by very strong self-report protective indicators that are highly predictive of lower PSS.

10,29134,10,21,"Participant 1 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.42) so this subjective complaint could push their perceived stress upward relative to peers.
- Sleep perception vs objective sleep: objective sleep duration/timing look adequate, so the discrepancy (good objective duration but poor subjective quality) can itself be associated with distress in some individuals.
- Small nocturnal heart-rate deviations: some early-morning HR values show larger negative deviations from mesor and these hourly values have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.25–0.31). These are modest contributors at best.

Participant 2 — potential reasons they might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 11 (z ≈ +1.98), a strong signal positively associated with higher PSS in this sample.
- Very irregular sleep timing: sleep start SD ≈ 183 minutes (z ≈ +2.20) and elevated sleep duration variability (z ≈ +1.33); high sleep variability is strongly linked with higher PSS in the study.
- Blunted heart-rate amplitude and some early-morning HR deviations: amplitude z ≈ -0.51 and small positive correlations of certain nocturnal HR values with PSS provide additional (weaker) physiological evidence toward higher perceived stress.
- Together the sleep-quality and sleep-regularity signals have large effect sizes in this profile and are the primary drivers toward elevated PSS relative to this participant’s cohort.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is relative to its own study mean (P1 mean = 21.5; P2 mean = 21.62). Participant 1’s integrated profile is explicitly judged as likely below their cohort mean (strong protective signals: maximal self-efficacy, very low GAD-7, low interpersonal/substance/emotional problems, high circadian stability, very low RHR). The only substantive risk for P1 is moderate subjective sleep complaints and small nocturnal HR correlations.
- Participant 2’s integrated profile is judged as near the cohort mean, with a modest tilt toward higher stress driven primarily by large sleep-related z-scores (PSQI and sleep-timing variability). Although P2 has several protective features (lower trait anxiety, exercise, positive self-evaluations, relatively low RHR), the magnitude of the sleep disturbances is larger than the protective signals’ z-scores and drives the inference slightly upward.
- Therefore, relative to their own cohorts, Participant 1 is likely below average perceived stress, while Participant 2 is likely at or slightly above average perceived stress. Because both cohort means are similar, the relative positions imply Participant 2 has the worse overall perceived stress.

- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 12; z = 0.46) — this is the single strongest predictor here and is very highly correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.77).  
- Very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 17.5; z = 1.32) — large effect and moderately correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.45).  
- Nocturnal autonomic arousal: several overnight hourly HR deviations substantially above the sample mean (e.g., midnight–1am z ≈ 1.02) that positively correlate with PSS (r ~0.22–0.39), consistent with impaired nocturnal recovery.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE z ≈ -0.25) with a fairly strong negative association with PSS (r ≈ -0.66), supporting greater perceived stress vulnerability.  
- Elevated substance-abuse subscale (z = 1.5) adds potential stress-relevant behavior to the profile.  
- Holistic summary provided in the description explicitly concludes this participant is above their study mean (population mean = 20.67).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Sleep risk signals: objectively short median sleep (~6 h 17 min; z ≈ -1.11), PSQI = 6 (classified as disturbed), late and variable sleep timing (start time median 00:48, SD ≈ 113 min, z ≈ 0.66), and sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 120 min; z = 0.43). These sleep features have modest positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ~0.14–0.21) and could elevate perceived stress.  
- Some nocturnal/early-morning HR deviations show small positive correlations with PSS (r up to ~0.21), suggesting mild physiological arousal risk.  
- Despite those, the description explicitly concludes this participant is likely below their study mean (population mean = 21.62), and the sleep signals are characterized as the main remaining vulnerability rather than dominant drivers of stress.

Comparative weighing within each study frame
- Participant 1’s top risk indicators (moderate/clinical anxiety and very poor PSQI) are both large in magnitude and strongly correlated with PSS in that study (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; PSQI r ≈ 0.45). Nocturnal HR elevations provide convergent physiological evidence. The report explicitly places Participant 1 above their population mean (20.67).  
- Participant 2, while showing objectively short and variable sleep (which modestly raises PSS risk), has multiple strong protective factors that are strongly associated with lower PSS in their study: very low trait anxiety (STAI-T z ≈ -1.71), low depressive symptoms (CES-D z ≈ -0.86), high self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise, and low resting HR. The report explicitly places Participant 2 below their population mean (21.62).  
- The magnitude and PSS-relevance of Participant 1’s adverse signals (especially the very high PSQI and highly PSS-correlated anxiety) appear greater than Participant 2’s mainly sleep-limited risk profile. Participant 2’s protective psychosocial/behavioral markers are substantial and likely offset their sleep-related risk.

19,23270,28,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Strong sleep-related risk signals linked to PSS:
  - Very poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 16.5; Z = +1.0) and objective extreme short sleep (median 2 h 38 m; Z = −0.94) and very irregular sleep timing (sleep-onset SD Z = +1.3). PSQI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.47) in this sample, so these are meaningful contributors.
  - Nocturnal cardiovascular arousal (hourly HR deviations +13.5 bpm at 1–2 AM, Z = +1.17; +9.8 bpm at 3–4 AM, Z = +1.59) which also correlates modestly with PSS (r ≈ 0.32–0.38).
- Clinically relevant anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 = 10; Z = +0.11). Anxiety symptoms in this cohort have a very strong correlation with PSS (r = 0.78), so even moderate anxiety is a high-leverage risk factor for elevated perceived stress.
- Some pain-related functional interference (PAPAS Z = +0.19) and circadian irregularity (interdaily stability and autocorrelation Zs negative; intradaily variability Z = +0.92), which are additional stress-associated features.
- Protective factors are present but moderate: above-average self-efficacy (Z = +0.3) and low emotional lability (Z = −0.97) should buffer stress, but the strongest contributors (sleep + anxiety + nocturnal arousal) are tightly linked to PSS in this sample and outweigh those protections.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Risk signals that could elevate perceived stress:
  - Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z = +0.56) and STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), so this is the main psychological risk factor.
  - Some circadian fragmentation/intradaily variability (IV Z ≈ +0.39) and reduced interdaily stability (Z = −0.24), which have small positive associations with stress.
  - Pronounced daytime HR elevations in the mid-morning (hourly deviations ≈ +19–+20 bpm; Z ≈ +1.9–2.1) indicating daytime physiological activation that could reflect sustained demand/arousal.
  - Low reported social/recreational time (large negative Z), which may reduce social buffering.
- Strong protective signals that argue against markedly elevated PSS:
  - Very good subjective sleep (PSQI = 4; Z = −1.26) and long objective sleep duration (≈ 8 h 49 m; Z = +2.03) — both strong, empirically protective factors.
  - Frequent exercise, minimal substance use, low resting heart rate and good nocturnal recovery, high academic functioning, and positive health/happiness ratings — multiple robust buffers against high perceived stress.
- Net inference in the original summary: profile is near the population mean PSS, possibly slightly above, but not substantially elevated.

Comparative within-population reasoning
- Both descriptions are relative to different study means (P1 mean = 20.75; P2 mean = 21.62). Each profile should be read as “relative to that study’s distribution.”
- Participant 1’s profile is explicitly judged “likely above the population mean” with several high-leverage risk signals that have strong correlations with PSS in that study (notably anxiety and sleep disturbance plus nocturnal physiological arousal). The objective sleep impairment is extreme for that sample and mapped to PSS-relevant metrics.
- Participant 2’s profile is characterized as “near to slightly above the population mean,” with the principal risk being trait anxiety and some daytime physiological activation, but multiple and strong protective factors (especially exceptionally long/regular sleep and frequent exercise) that reduce the likelihood of a substantially elevated PSS relative to their cohort.
- The strength and number of PSS-related risk signals are greater and more directly tied to PSS in Participant 1’s summary (sleep disruption + nocturnal arousal and anxiety with high PSS correlations) than in Participant 2’s summary, where the main risks are smaller in magnitude or have weaker correlations with PSS and are offset by robust protective factors.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple strong contributors to higher perceived stress in that cohort (severe subjective/objective sleep problems, nocturnal physiological arousal, and clinically relevant anxiety) outweigh modest protective traits.
- Participant 2: some risk (trait anxiety, daytime HR spikes) but large, consistent protective factors (very good/long sleep, fitness, low substance use, high functioning) yielding a net profile close to the sample mean and not markedly elevated.
- Conclusion: Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (i.e., a higher PSS relative to their study population) than Participant 2 is relative to theirs.

4,79834,31,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 (clinically disturbed) — subjective sleep complaints commonly track higher perceived stress even when objective sleep duration appears adequate.  
- Lifestyle/social factors: Late median sleep onset (~00:46), low exercise and low engagement in leisure/social activities — reduced behavioral stress-buffering could elevate perceived stress.  
- Low interpersonal trust and elevated alcohol use: Trust z ≈ -1.42 and alcohol use z ≈ 1.68 could reflect reduced social support and coping-by-substance use, both associated with greater perceived stress.  
- Subjective–objective mismatch: Long/regular wearable-recorded sleep combined with subjective disturbance could indicate fragmented or nonrestorative sleep that maps onto perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Severe anxiety: GAD-7 = 18 (Z ≈ 1.51) — strong, direct correlate of PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.75), and a powerful predictor of elevated perceived stress.  
- Very poor subjective sleep: PSQI = 16 (Z ≈ 0.83) — large subjective sleep problems that correlate with higher PSS.  
- High pain and activity interference: PEG-3 and PAPAS elevated (Z ≈ 1.4–1.6) — reduce coping capacity and correlate with higher PSS.  
- Low self-efficacy: NGSE Z ≈ -1.73 — robust negative correlate of PSS (r ≈ -0.61), indicating reduced confidence in coping and higher likely perceived stress.  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Large positive nocturnal HR deviations (e.g., 12–1 AM Z = 2.83) and short median sleep (~4 h 55 m) consistent with hyperarousal/fragmentation that maps onto higher PSS.

Comparative reasoning within each study’s frame
- Participant 1 is inferred to be below their study’s mean PSS (mean = 21.62). The strongest signals are physiological/circadian robustness (low resting HR, high amplitude and 24-hr autocorrelation, low intradaily variability) and low depressive/trait-anxiety scores — these are consistent, moderately strong negative correlates of PSS in that cohort. The higher-stress indicators for P1 are weaker (PSQI just over cutoff, lifestyle factors, alcohol/trust signals) and have smaller or more ambiguous correlations with PSS in this dataset.  
- Participant 2 is inferred to be above their study’s mean PSS (mean = 20.62). The strongest signals are large, directly stress-related self-report measures (severe anxiety, very high PSQI, elevated pain interference, very low self-efficacy) with substantial correlations to PSS, plus nocturnal physiological arousal that converges with subjective reports. Protective wearable circadian signals for P2 are present but modest and do not outweigh the large symptom-based signals.

Balance of evidence and decision
- The magnitude and directness of Participant 2’s symptom signals (especially severe anxiety, very high PSQI, low self-efficacy, and elevated pain interference), together with corroborating nocturnal physiological arousal, represent a much stronger and more specific indication of elevated perceived stress than the comparatively modest and mixed higher-stress signals in Participant 1.  
- Participant 1’s dominant signals are physiological and symptom indicators of lower stress, making it unlikely P1’s PSS exceeds P2’s inferred level.

18,22455,18,30,"Short answer: Participant 1 likely exhibits the higher perceived stress.

Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (evidence from their description)
- Self-report anxiety and affect: GAD-7 = 14.5 (Z = +0.9) — moderate-to-high anxiety and very strongly correlated with PSS in this sample (r = 0.80). Elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24) also correlates with higher PSS (r = 0.66).  
- Marked sleep disruption: PSQI = 13 (disturbed sleep); objectively extremely short median sleep (2 h 19 min, Z ≈ -1.04), very late and highly variable sleep onset (start-time SD Z = +1.16). Sleep measures are positively associated with PSS in this sample (moderate correlations).  
- Physiological arousal and circadian disruption: elevated resting HR (81.2 bpm, Z = +1.67), low circadian amplitude (Z = -1.57), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.34), elevated intradaily variability (Z = +1.23). Nocturnal heart-rate elevations (midnight–2 AM) that correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.42).  
- Pain and interference: PEG-3 and pain burden correlate positively with PSS (e.g., r ≈ 0.47 for pain burden), and are elevated.  
- Net: multiple strong, converging predictors of higher PSS (especially anxiety and nocturnal arousal) outweigh modest protective factor (slightly higher self-efficacy).

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Objective circadian and sleep signals: reduced circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -1.52), lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9), slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.32). These wearable-derived rhythm disruptions have small-to-modest positive associations with PSS in this sample.  
- Shorter-than-average sleep duration and elevated variability: median 6 h 7 min (Z ≈ -1.33) and increased night-to-night variability (SD Z ≈ +0.94) — both linked (weakly to moderately) to higher PSS here.  
- Behavioral patterns: high TV/internet use (TV Z ≈ +2.54) and some sedentary/leisure patterns weakly associated with higher PSS.  
- Unusual early-morning HR elevations (large positive deviations at 5–7 AM) — physiologically atypical and potentially indicative of early awakenings or habitual early activity; interpretation relative to stress is uncertain.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning
- Direction relative to each sample mean: Participant 1’s profile is judged (by the description) to be above their study mean (PSS mean = 21.17). Participant 2’s profile is judged to be below their study mean (PSS mean = 21.59).  
- Strength and relevance of predictors: Participant 1’s strongest predictors of PSS are high trait anxiety (GAD-7) and nocturnal physiological arousal, with large sample-level correlations (notably r = 0.80 for GAD-7 and r ≈ 0.28–0.42 for nocturnal HR elevations). Participant 2’s strongest signals supporting lower stress are low trait anxiety (STAI-Trait Z = -1.31) and high self-reported well‑being (large positive Zs for happiness, health satisfaction, self‑esteem), which are also meaningfully correlated with lower PSS; their objective markers that would push toward higher PSS have smaller correlations with PSS in this sample.  
- Balance of evidence: Participant 1 shows multiple converging, relatively strong indicators of elevated perceived stress (anxiety, severe sleep deprivation/disruption, nocturnal HR arousal, pain). Participant 2 shows favorable self-report (low anxiety, high well-being) that outweighs the modest objective rhythm/sleep irregularities. Thus, Participant 1’s profile indicates a higher PSS than Participant 2’s.

7,58196,15,24,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Elevated intradaily variability (fragmented within‑day rhythm; value z ≈ +0.81), which in this sample has a modest positive correlation with PSS (~+0.16).
- Reduced day‑to‑day regularity (interdaily stability z ≈ −0.57; 24‑hour autocorrelation z ≈ −0.87), which modestly associates with higher PSS.
- Blunted circadian cardiac rhythm (cosinor amplitude z ≈ −0.63; mesor z ≈ −1.01), again modestly linked to higher PSS.
- Shorter than average nocturnal sleep (median 6 h 33 min, z ≈ −0.79) and late/variable sleep timing (median start ~01:02 AM, SD ≈ 72 min) — both can associate with increased perceived stress.
- Slightly elevated daytime napping (mean 0.15 naps/day, z ≈ +0.94), which correlates weakly with higher PSS.

(However: these signals are described as modestly correlated with PSS and are counterbalanced by multiple, stronger self‑report and physiological indicators of low stress—low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, good subjective sleep quality, frequent exercise, low resting HR, etc. The summary explicitly concludes Participant 1 is likely below their population mean PSS.)

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 15.5; z ≈ +0.67), with PSQI showing a relatively strong positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.53).
- Very short median nightly sleep (4 h 22 min) and large night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD = 216 min; z ≈ +0.89) and sleep onset time (SD = 204 min; z ≈ +0.34), all well‑established correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Substantially elevated interpersonal problems (BASIS‑24 Interpersonal z ≈ +2.34), a salient contextual source of ongoing stress despite only a weak sample correlation with PSS.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and reduced regularity (amplitude z ≈ −0.84; interdaily stability z ≈ −1.05; low 24‑h autocorrelation), consistent with disrupted behavioral structure that often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Evening heart‑rate pattern and general weakened circadian organization that can co‑occur with elevated stress.

(However: Participant 2 also shows protective signs—very low current anxiety (GAD‑7 z ≈ −1.38), low pain and emotional lability, near‑average self‑efficacy, and below‑mean resting HR—which temper the overall inference.)

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Each description is framed relative to its own study population (Participant 1 population mean PSS = 21.61; Participant 2 population mean PSS = 21.29). These population means are nearly identical, so relative positions are directly comparable.
- Participant 1 is described as likely below their population mean, with multiple strong self‑report and physiological indicators pointing to lower perceived stress; the higher‑stress signals in Participant 1 are mainly modest wearable rhythm irregularities.
- Participant 2 is described as near the population mean but with a modest tilt toward being above it. The tilt is driven primarily by very poor subjective sleep and extreme objective short/variable sleep, plus pronounced interpersonal strain and circadian dampening—several of which (especially PSQI and sleep duration/variability) have fairly strong associations with PSS in the dataset.
- Overall balance: Participant 2 shows more and stronger indicators that align with elevated perceived stress (notably severe sleep disturbance and interpersonal problems) than Participant 1, whose stronger indicators point toward lower perceived stress and whose higher‑stress indicators are weaker/modest.

15,42137,15,25,"Reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample mean = 21.61)
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI Z ≈ 0.07; CES-D Z ≈ 0.18), both positively correlated with PSS in the sample.
- Poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = 0.59), which correlates with higher PSS.
- Greater intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.60) and reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.72; mesor Z = -1.55) — features that, in this dataset, are associated with higher perceived stress.
- Pronounced daytime heart-rate elevations at specific hours (late morning and late afternoon) that could reflect periods of heightened physiological activation tied to stress.
- Reduced reported happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and lower socializing (Z ≈ -0.62), which can be associated with higher perceived stress.

Reasons mitigating against a substantially higher PSS for Participant 1
- Objective sleep duration is adequate (7 h 18 min; Z = 0.14) and sleep-timing variability is not extreme.
- Frequent exercise (Z = 1.07) and low resting heart rate (RHR Z = -0.93), both protective against high perceived stress.
- Reasonable day-to-day rhythm stability (interdaily stability Z = 0.33).
- Net interpretation in the description: only a modest tilt above the sample mean rather than a clear elevation.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study sample mean = 21.29)
- Strong subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 0.67) with a substantial sample correlation to PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- High pain/functional impairment (PAPAS Z = 0.93), also strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.53).
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62), and NGSE has a strong negative correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.69), so this is a potent predictor of higher PSS.
- Elevated mesor and resting heart rate (mesor Z ≈ 0.7; RHR Z ≈ 0.61) and markedly elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations (night Zs up to ≈ 1.38) — physiological markers that in this dataset associate with higher PSS.
- Reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83) and a late acrophase, consistent with stress-linked circadian disruption.

Reasons mitigating against a substantially higher PSS for Participant 2
- Relatively low current anxiety (GAD-7 Z = -0.76), and GAD-7 is strongly correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.76), so this works against extreme PSS.
- Low intradaily variability (IV Z = -1.28) and relatively long nightly sleep duration (Z = 0.92), which can be protective or buffer against higher perceived stress.
- Net interpretation in the description: likely above the mean but moderated by some protective factors.

Comparative, within-sample reasoning and overall weighing of evidence
- Both participants are described as having multimodal, mixed profiles and neither is an extreme outlier in raw PSS. Their sample means are nearly identical (21.61 vs 21.29), so comparison should focus on the strength and number of stress-linked signals (and their sample correlations).
- Participant 1 shows several modest stress-linked signals (PSQI Z ≈ 0.59; IV Z ≈ 0.60; small positive symptom Zs), but also multiple fairly strong protective indicators (exercise Z = 1.07; RHR Z = -0.93; good objective sleep duration). Many of Participant 1’s stress signals have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS in the sample.
- Participant 2 shows a larger set of relatively strong stress-linked indicators with larger Z-scores and stronger sample-level correlations to PSS: high pain (PAPAS Z = 0.93, r ≈ 0.53), poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = 0.67, r ≈ 0.53), low self-efficacy (NGSE Z = -0.62, r ≈ -0.69), elevated nocturnal HR deviations (Zs up to ≈ 1.38, r up to ≈ 0.47), and reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.83). Although Participant 2 has some protective features (low GAD-7, long sleep, low IV), the magnitude and number of risk indicators and their strong correlations with PSS suggest a clearer elevation above their population mean than is present for Participant 1.
- Therefore, balancing quantity, magnitude (Z-scores), and the strength of sample-level correlations with PSS, Participant 2’s profile indicates a higher perceived stress relative to their study sample than Participant 1’s profile does relative to theirs.

2,21793,38,27,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high clinical anxiety (GAD-7 = 21; Z ≈ +2.04, “severe”), a strong correlate of PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.71).
- Extremely short objective sleep (median ~3 h 42 min) and large night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 173 min), plus very poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.49) — sleep loss and fragmentation strongly amplify perceived stress.
- High pain and interference (PEG-3 / PAPAS Z ≈ +2.28) and marked emotional lability (BASIS-24 Emotional Lability Z ≈ +2.42), both associated with higher stress.
- Low general self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -2.29), which removes coping resources and typically increases perceived stress.
- Wearable circadian features consistent with fragmentation (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability) and nocturnal heart‑rate deviations correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.48–0.51), supporting physiological arousal at night.
- Although there are some protective features (low substance use, preserved interpersonal functioning, low resting HR possibly from fitness), they appear insufficient relative to multiple large positive stress indicators.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.05) and objectively short sleep (median ~6 h 9 min; Z ≈ -1.29).
- Very late and highly variable sleep timing (median start ~03:36 AM; start-time SD Z ≈ +1.04) and very high nap frequency (mean daily naps Z ≈ +3.05), which co-occur with higher perceived stress.
- Circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.98, intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.95) and blunted heart-rate amplitude, consistent with dysregulated 24‑h physiology linked to higher stress.
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.17) and some mood indicators (CES-D Z ≈ +0.18, lower happiness Z ≈ -0.53) that correlate positively with PSS.
- External/behavioral stressors (recent GPA drop) and reduced engagement in restorative activities, which can elevate perceived stress.
- Offsetting/protective factors include low resting HR and MESOR (may indicate fitness or lower physiological arousal), minimal substance use, moderate health satisfaction, and some social/exercise engagement.

Comparative, within-population interpretation
- Both profiles are judged above their respective study means, but the magnitude and concentration of high-risk signals differ.
- Participant 1 shows multiple very large deviations (several Z ≈ +2 or higher: severe GAD-7, emotional lability, pain; NGSE Z ≈ -2.29; extremely short objective sleep) and physiological nocturnal arousal signals that are moderately correlated with PSS. These are strong, convergent indicators across psychological, somatic, and objective-sleep domains.
- Participant 2 displays a coherent pattern of sleep/timing and circadian irregularity with one very large Z (nap frequency Z ≈ +3.05) and near-2 SD interdaily instability, but psychological symptom elevations (anxiety, depressive symptoms) are generally modest (Zs ≈ +0.17–+0.18). Several protective features (low resting HR, low substance use, some social/exercise) are more evident than in Participant 1.
- Relative z‑score magnitudes and clinical severity favor Participant 1 as having a more extreme stress-related profile: Participant 1’s severe anxiety and near-total sleep deprivation are stronger, higher‑impact indicators of elevated perceived stress than Participant 2’s mainly circadian/sleep‑timing dysregulation and modest trait anxiety.

Balance of evidence and determination
- Considering within-sample correlations, the number and magnitude of high-risk indicators, and convergence across self-report and wearable measures, Participant 1 most likely exhibits the higher perceived stress (higher PSS) compared with Participant 2.

- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and large objective sleep variability (sleep SD ≈ 136 min; Z ≈ 0.8), both associated with higher PSS.
- Circadian instability: reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.82), slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.10), and low 24-h autocorrelation — patterns that track with greater perceived stress in the sample.
- Pronounced late-afternoon HR deviations (4–5 pm aggregate deviation, Z = 2.06) indicative of sustained daytime arousal.
- Elevated internet use (3–4 hr/day, Z = 1.52), a behavioral correlate that in this dataset aligns with higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study mean)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI r with PSS = 0.46) that tends to co-occur with higher PSS.
- Severe objective sleep restriction (median nightly sleep ≈ 3 h 27 min; Z = -0.66) and very high sleep-duration variability (SD = 197 min; Z = 0.62).
- High intradaily variability (Z = 2.29), indicating fragmented/rest-activity rhythms associated with higher PSS.
- Increased mean daily naps (Z = 1.24) and elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z = 0.94) as additional stress-relevant indicators.

Comparative, within-study-frame reasoning
- Both summaries are written relative to their own sample means (P1: mean PSS = 21.61; P2: mean PSS = 21.42). Thus we must compare each participant’s pattern to their study’s normative correlates rather than raw scores.
- Participant 1’s profile is explicitly characterized as near the population mean with a modest tilt toward elevated stress. Their higher-stress signals (trait anxiety, sleep/circadian disruption, afternoon HR elevation) are balanced by several strong protective factors (high self-esteem, high health satisfaction/happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR and good HR amplitude). The net inference was “near mean” with slight elevation.
- Participant 2’s profile is mixed but the summary emphasizes that the strongest sample-level predictors point toward lower perceived stress. Specifically, very low anxiety (GAD-7 = 4; Z = -0.94) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE) have large sample correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r = 0.76; NGSE r = -0.65), and both strongly favor lower PSS. Although sleep measures are severely adverse (short sleep, high PSQI, high intradaily variability), the study-weighted inference was that P2 is below the sample mean.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: net inference = near mean with a modest lean toward higher perceived stress.
- Participant 2: net inference = below mean despite severe sleep problems, because the strongest predictors in the sample (low anxiety, high self-efficacy, low emotional lability) indicate lower PSS.
- Because both participants’ population means are very similar, the relevant comparison is which profile is more likely to be above its own sample mean. P1’s summary explicitly tilts toward elevated stress (near/above mean), whereas P2’s summary explicitly leans toward lower-than-mean stress.
- Therefore Participant 1 is more likely to exhibit the worse overall perceived stress (i.e., a higher PSS relative to their study population).

- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 16; Z ≈ +0.83) — PSQI correlates moderately-strongly with PSS (r ≈ 0.58), so this is a substantive upward driver.
- Very short wearable median sleep (1 h 44 min; Z ≈ −1.24) and high sleep start-time variability — objective signs align with subjective sleep problems and can push inferred PSS up.
- Elevated pain/interference (PEG-3 ≈ 7.78, Z ≈ +0.71; PAPAS Z ≈ +0.8) — both moderately correlated with PSS, so they contribute upward pressure.
- Some nocturnal HR deviations (modest positive deviations around midnight–early morning) that weakly correlate with higher PSS.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (relative to their study population)
- Markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 39; Z ≈ +2.67) — a strong signal well above the population mean and positively associated with PSS.
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI‑Trait Z ≈ +1.35) — another strong, PSS-correlated affective risk.
- Poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52), late median sleep start (~01:25 AM) and high sleep timing variability — these are known correlates of higher perceived stress.
- Objective circadian irregularity: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −1.56) and reduced amplitude (Z ≈ −1.04) — rhythm disruptions associated with higher PSS.
- Low self‑esteem and low current happiness (Z ≈ −1.85 and −1.61), which are psychosocial indicators linked to higher perceived stress.
- Evening physiological activation (elevated evening HR deviations) consistent with increased evening arousal/rumination.

Comparative within-population reasoning
- Participant 1’s upward signals (sleep disturbance, pain) are meaningful but generally in the ~0.7–0.8 SD range; however, Participant 1 also shows multiple stronger protective indicators (GAD‑7 Z ≈ −1.2, low emotional lability Z ≈ −1.17, robust circadian metrics including amplitude Z ≈ +1.38, low intradaily variability Z ≈ −1.35, low resting HR Z ≈ −1.02). The net characterization in the participant’s frame is “near the population mean” with a modest uplift due to sleep and pain.
- Participant 2 shows multiple large risk signals, including one very large deviation (CES‑D Z ≈ +2.67) and several >1 SD deviations in adverse directions (PSQI, STAI, interdaily stability, low self-esteem, low happiness). Protective signals are modest (limited substance use, some social/exercise engagement, normal resting HR) and do not offset the converging large affective, sleep, and circadian disturbances. The participant’s description explicitly places them above their population mean.

Balance of evidence and decision
- The magnitude, number, and consistency of elevated risk indicators are substantially greater for Participant 2 than for Participant 1. Participant 1’s risks are more targeted (sleep, pain) and counterbalanced by several robust protective factors; Participant 2 has broad, multi-domain elevations (depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, circadian irregularity, low self‑esteem) that together point to a higher perceived stress relative to their cohort.

- Late median sleep timing (~01:03 AM) combined with reduced stability could reflect a less regular daily schedule, which modestly associates with greater perceived stress in this dataset.  
- These physiologic/circadian signals are the main evidence that could push this participant toward higher perceived stress, but their correlations with PSS are relatively small compared with the participant’s strong self-report indicators of low distress.

Reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (if any)
- Strongly elevated self-report predictors of stress: very high GAD-7 (Z = 1.51; r with PSS ≈ 0.74), severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 1.65; r ≈ 0.43), elevated emotional lability (Z = 1.03; r ≈ 0.63), and increased pain/interference. These measures converge and have large correlations with PSS in this sample.  
- Lower self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ -0.44; r ≈ -0.66) further indicates reduced coping resources, which is strongly related to higher perceived stress here.  
- Although objective wearables indicate preserved circadian structure and low resting HR (protective features), their correlations with PSS are smaller and do not outweigh the strong subjective signal.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each description is explicitly anchored to its own cohort mean: Participant 1 is inferred to be below their population mean (21.62) while Participant 2 is inferred to be above their population mean (20.54).  
- The magnitude and predictive strength of Participant 2’s elevated subjective measures (especially GAD-7 and PSQI) are substantially larger and more strongly correlated with PSS than the circadian deviations that point toward higher stress in Participant 1.  
- Participant 1’s profile is dominated by low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem/happiness, good sleep duration, and healthy behaviors — all consistent with lower-than-average PSS and with weaker contrary wearable signals. Participant 2’s profile is dominated by multiple high-impact self-report risk factors for PSS despite some protective wearable markers.

Weighing the evidence
- The preponderance and effect-size strength of indicators point to Participant 2 as having the worse overall perceived stress.

3,77036,13,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10.5, clearly “Disturbed Sleep”); PSQI correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.47) so this is a salient risk factor.
- Moderate pain/interference (PEG-3 ≈ 4.9; PAPAS ~50) that is above the population median and correlates moderately with PSS (≈ 0.42–0.47).
- Elevated interpersonal strain (BASIS-24 interpersonal Z ≈ 1.54), which plausibly reduces social buffering resources.
- Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z ≈ 1.16–1.22), consistent with increased basal autonomic arousal (even if only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample).

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (relative to their study population)
- Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 6, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which is linked to higher PSS.
- Modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; z ≈ 0.17), a contributor to higher perceived stress.
- Limited daily social/recreational engagement (socializing z ≈ -1.41 and multiple “do not do” leisure activities), reducing stress-buffering resources.
- Slightly above-average resting heart rate (z ≈ 0.36) and somewhat short objective sleep duration (~6 h 51 m, z ≈ -0.41), both possible small contributors to higher stress.

Comparative reasoning within each study frame
- Severity/magnitude of key risk markers: Participant 1’s subjective sleep problem is substantially worse (PSQI 10.5) than Participant 2’s (PSQI 6). Participant 1 also shows moderate pain/interference and relatively large interpersonal-strain Z; these are more pronounced risk signals than Participant 2’s generally modest STAI elevation and social/recreational deficits.
- Protective resources: Participant 1 has a very strong protective factor in high self-efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 1.41), plus excellent circadian regularity and low emotional lability; these push P1’s inferred PSS downward. Participant 2 has very strong objective circadian stability (autocorrelation Z ≈ 2.49), low depressive symptoms, and above-average happiness — also protective but the sleep complaints and social isolation are milder than P1’s combined sleep/pain/interpersonal issues.
- Net balance: Both profiles were interpreted in their summaries as near the population mean with modest leanings toward slightly below-average PSS. However, the intensity of Participant 1’s stress-relevant complaints (very high PSQI, tangible pain/interference, notable interpersonal strain, plus elevated resting HR) represent stronger and more numerous risk signals than Participant 2’s primarily milder risks (PSQI = 6, small trait-anxiety elevation, low social engagement). Although Participant 1’s high NGSE is a powerful protective factor, on balance the combination of severe subjective sleep disturbance + pain + interpersonal strain suggests a higher likelihood of elevated perceived stress relative to Participant 2’s profile.

5,84502,14,23,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score
- Elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52), which in this sample correlates positively with PSS and is a common stress-related signal.
- Modest depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 18; Z ≈ 0.49) and lower self-rated happiness (Z ≈ -0.53), both features that tend to co-vary with higher perceived stress (CES‑D and STAI show positive correlations with PSS in the cohort).
- Increased night-to-night variability in total sleep time (SD ≈ 109 min) and some intradaily variability in activity/HR (IV = 0.55), which have modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Small positive early‑morning HR deviations and pronounced late‑afternoon HR spikes (could reflect physiological arousal for parts of the day), which may align with stress for some hours.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score
- Very high subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 13.5) and objectively extreme short median sleep (~3 h/night) — both strongly associated with higher PSS in the sample (PSQI r ≈ 0.50).
- Extremely large variability in sleep timing (SD = 401 min; Z = 2.82), indicating severe circadian/schedule instability that strongly aligns with elevated perceived stress.
- Elevated anxiety symptoms (GAD‑7 = 9) and higher emotional lability (BASIS‑24 subscale), with very strong sample correlations with PSS (GAD r ≈ 0.78; emotional lability r ≈ 0.68).
- Substance‑related problems (BASIS‑24 Substance Abuse Z = 1.75) and some pain interference indicators that correlate positively with PSS.
- Reduced interdaily stability and lower rhythm amplitude (Zs ≈ -1.4 to -1.1), consistent with circadian dysregulation linked to higher PSS.

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Magnitude of risk signals: Participant 2 presents multiple large, concordant risk signals (extreme short sleep, huge sleep‑timing variability Z ≈ 2.82, strong anxiety signal with high correlation to PSS, substance problems) that are both large in standardized effect and tied to measures that show strong correlations with PSS in that study sample. Participant 1’s risk signals are more modest in size (PSQI Z = 1.52, CES‑D Z ≈ 0.49, sleep variability moderate) and partially counterbalanced by several protective objective markers.
- Protective factors: Both participants have some protective physiological markers (lower resting HR/mesor), but Participant 1 also shows strong circadian regularity, adequate median sleep duration, low substance use, and frequent social exercise — several salient protective features that in this cohort relate to lower PSS. Participant 2’s strongest protective factor is very high self‑efficacy (NGSE Z ≈ 1.79, r ≈ -0.63), but that appears insufficient to fully offset the severity and breadth of sleep, anxiety, circadian, and substance‑related risk signals.
- Correlational weight: Many of Participant 2’s elevated measures have large correlations with PSS in that dataset (GAD‑7, emotional lability, PSQI), increasing confidence that those anomalies indicate substantially higher perceived stress relative to that study’s mean. Participant 1’s elevated measures either have smaller correlations with PSS or are offset by objective resilient behaviors.

Overall judgment
- Participant 2 more likely exhibits the worse (higher) overall perceived stress compared with Participant 1, when judged relative to each participant’s study population.

13,20335,28,19,"Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Late sleep timing and somewhat short sleep duration (median sleep start ~01:53 AM; ~6 h 35 min) — sleep restriction and delayed timing can increase perceived stress or reduce resilience.
- Pronounced evening/nighttime heart-rate elevations (notably 12–1 AM +23.9 bpm, Z ≈ 3.66) that could reflect late-evening arousal or stress-related activation.
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.81), suggesting fragmentation of activity/arousal across the day.
- Modest alcohol use (1–2×/week) and very high sedentary/leisure hobby time (Z ≈ 2.01) that could be neutral-to-modest risk factors for higher perceived stress in some contexts.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS score (if any)
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9) — strongly positively correlated with PSS in this dataset.
- Mild anxiety (GAD-7 = 7.5) and elevated emotional lability (BASIS-24 EL = 6.33), both of which have strong positive correlations with PSS (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.80; emotional lability r ≈ 0.67).
- Pain and activity interference (PEG-3 = 5.56; PAPAS = 55) that correlate positively with PSS and can increase perceived stress burden.
- Some nocturnal heart-rate deviations linked to stress (late-night HR elevations correlated with higher PSS).

Comparative, within-population reasoning
- Each profile is interpreted relative to its own study mean: Participant 1 is described as likely below their population mean PSS (mean = 21.62), driven largely by very low depression/anxiety scores, high happiness/self‑esteem, robust circadian amplitude and low resting HR. The evening-arousal signals are notable but characterized as secondary to a broadly low-stress profile.
- Participant 2 is described as likely above their population mean PSS (mean = 20.75), driven primarily by self-report indicators that strongly predict higher PSS in this sample (poor subjective sleep, anxiety, emotional lability, and pain). Wearable-derived circadian regularity is protective but judged insufficient to offset the strong survey-based signals.
- In this dataset self-report measures (especially anxiety, subjective sleep quality, and emotional lability) show larger and more direct correlations with PSS than the wearable rhythm metrics. Participant 2’s strongest signals are these high-weight self-report predictors of elevated PSS; Participant 1’s strongest signals are self-report and physiological indicators of low stress, with only moderate wearable signs of risk concentrated in the evening.

Weighing the balance of evidence
- Participant 1: multiple strong indicators of lower perceived stress relative to peers; evening/night arousal is the main caveat but insufficient to overturn the low-stress self-report/physiology signal.
- Participant 2: several strong, highly PSS-correlated self-report indicators of elevated stress (poor sleep quality, anxiety, emotional lability, pain) with wearable measures providing partial mitigation but not overriding the self-report signal.
Conclusion: Participant 2 is more likely to exhibit the higher overall perceived stress.

23,18111,17,28,"Summary judgment: Participant 2 likely has the higher perceived stress.

Potential reasons Participant 1 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Marked subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10.5 (clinically significant) — PSQI correlates moderately with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.48).
- Very short objective sleep duration: median ≈ 4 h 21 m and large night-to-night timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 123 minutes) — insufficient/irregular sleep often accompanies higher perceived stress.
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: elevated overnight heart-rate deviations around midnight–2:00 AM (e.g., +11.96 to +14.62 bpm; z > 1); the 1–2 AM deviation correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.46).
- These sleep/nocturnal signals are the primary evidence that could push inferred PSS upward for this participant.

Potential reasons Participant 2 might have a higher PSS (from their description)
- Elevated internalizing symptom burden: CES-D = 27 (z = +1.42, “Depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 48 (z = +0.66, “anxious”); both measures correlate moderately with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31).
- Low self-rated happiness (z ≈ -1.61), consistent with elevated distress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) plus late sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:19) and substantial variability; higher nap rate (z = +2.27) suggesting daytime sleepiness/fragmentation.
- Blunted/irregular circadian physiology: low amplitude (z = -1.48) and low interdaily stability (z = -1.40), and pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (8–9 pm deviation +20.14, z ≈ +1.85) — together pointing to rhythm disruption and elevated evening arousal.
- Behavioral signs consistent with stress (less restorative leisure, more internet use).
- These converging symptom and circadian/rhythm indicators support above-mean PSS for this participant.

Comparative, within-sample weighting and rationale
- Each profile is already framed relative to its own study mean PSS (21.21 for Participant 1; 21.6 for Participant 2). Thus we compare relative signals rather than absolute PSS values across studies.
- Strength and correlation of indicators:
  - Participant 1’s strongest signals toward lower PSS are very low GAD-7 (2.0) and relatively high self-efficacy (NGSE), and these measures have large correlations with PSS in the sample (GAD-7 r ≈ 0.77; NGSE r ≈ -0.65). Those strong protective signals carry substantial weight in inferring below-mean PSS.
  - Participant 1’s risk signals (PSQI, short sleep, nocturnal HR deviations) have moderate correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.46–0.48) but are fewer in number and tied specifically to sleep/nighttime disturbance rather than broad daytime/internalizing symptoms.
  - Participant 2 shows multiple elevated self-report symptom measures (depression, trait anxiety, low happiness) and sleep/circadian disruption that converge toward higher PSS. While individual correlations with PSS for CES-D and STAI are smaller than the GAD-7→PSS link in Participant 1’s sample, the convergence of several elevated symptom scales plus rhythm disruption produces a robust above-mean signal.
- Protective signals for Participant 2 (normal resting HR, adequate average sleep duration, functioning) mitigate but do not outweigh the constellation of elevated internalizing symptoms and circadian/sleep irregularity.
- Overall balance: Participant 1’s dominant signals are strong protective trait measures with large PSS associations, despite notable sleep-specific risk. Participant 2’s dominant signals are elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms and circadian/sleep disruption that together point above that study’s mean. Given both profiles are assessed relative to their own populations, Participant 2 presents the clearer and broader pattern of above-mean perceived stress, while Participant 1 is inferred below-mean.
