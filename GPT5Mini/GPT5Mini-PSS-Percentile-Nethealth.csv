44869,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report symptom profile and psychological traits:
The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 22; Z ≈ 0.9) while trait anxiety is not elevated relative to peers (STAI-T = 39; Z ≈ −0.23). Self-esteem is at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40; Z ≈ 0.26). Subjective sleep disturbance is pronounced (PSQI = 10; Z ≈ 1.52), indicating appreciable perceived sleep problems despite the relatively high self-reported happiness/health satisfaction being only modestly reduced (happiness Z ≈ −0.53, health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.55). These self-report patterns point to an internal symptom burden (notably depressive symptoms and poor perceived sleep) coexisting with intact self-esteem and low trait anxiety.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
Behavioral data show minimal engagement in organized or social exercise (exercise alone 1–2 times/month; exercise with others not at all) and no reported alcohol or recreational drug use. Sedentary recreational time is a marked feature: “sedentary hobby” exceeds 4 hours/day (Z ≈ 3.19) and TV/video viewing is higher than average (Z ≈ 1.91). Time spent socializing is modest (1–2 hours; Z ≈ 0.16). This pattern—low physical activity and high sedentary leisure—aligns with lifestyle factors that often accompany elevated perceived stress and poorer mood in student samples.

Sleep behavior and variability:
Wearable and survey sleep metrics show a complex picture. Median nightly sleep duration from the device is relatively long (8 h 26 min; Z ≈ 1.55), and mean daily naps are essentially absent (Z ≈ −0.86). However, objective sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 00:59) and both sleep duration and sleep start time are highly variable across nights (sleep duration SD ≈ 193 minutes, Z ≈ 2.09; sleep start SD ≈ 157 minutes, Z ≈ 1.63). These objective irregularities dovetail with the elevated PSQI score: despite long average sleep, the participant experiences poor subjective sleep quality and irregular schedules—features that are often associated with elevated perceived stress and mood symptoms.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Cardiac and circadian features indicate heightened physiological arousal and a blunted daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is elevated (78.4 bpm; Z ≈ 2.41) and the MESOR of aggregate hourly heart rate is high (MESOR = 88.34; Z ≈ 1.97), while rhythm amplitude is relatively reduced (amplitude = 7.97; Z ≈ −0.91). Intradaily variability is higher than average (IV = 0.71; Z ≈ 1.16), whereas interdaily stability is near average (IS = 0.43; Z ≈ 0.17). The hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal decline and daytime increases, but overall a reduced amplitude plus elevated mean heart rate suggests greater tonic cardiovascular activation and circadian fragmentation. These physiological markers (elevated resting HR, higher IV, reduced amplitude) are consistent with greater autonomic arousal and diminished circadian robustness, both of which are commonly linked to higher perceived stress.

Concordance of modalities and implications for perceived stress:
Several modalities converge toward patterns that typically accompany elevated perceived stress: elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), large night-to-night sleep variability, reduced daytime activity/increased sedentary behavior, elevated resting heart rate, and higher intradaily variability with lower amplitude of heart-rate rhythms. Correlations in the dataset show modest positive associations between depressive symptoms and perceived stress (CES-D correlation ≈ 0.28) and between trait anxiety and perceived stress (STAI correlation ≈ 0.31), and smaller positive associations for resting heart rate and circadian fragmentation (resting HR correlation ≈ 0.14; IV correlation ≈ 0.16). Protective or buffering signals are present but limited: high self-esteem and absence of substance use may moderate stress responses but do not outweigh the combination of disturbed sleep, physiological arousal, and sedentary habits. On balance, the multimodal evidence more strongly supports placement in the higher half of the PSS distribution.

Final determination:
Based on the integrated pattern of elevated depressive symptoms, marked subjective sleep disturbance with high objective variability, elevated resting heart rate and mesor, and signs of circadian fragmentation combined with low physical activity and high sedentary time, the participant is more consistent with higher perceived stress within this study population.

92552,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report indicators and trait measures point to a mixed risk profile for perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z ≈ 0.37) is elevated relative to the study population, and subjective sleep quality is poorer than average (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep; Z ≈ 0.59). Depressive symptoms are lower and near the population mean (CES-D = 15, Z ≈ 0.18), and self-reported happiness and self-esteem are higher than average (happiness Z ≈ 0.55; self-esteem Z ≈ 0.82), which are generally protective against perceived stress. Alcohol use is somewhat above average (beer and wine/liquor use Z ≈ 1.0 and 0.94), while recreational drug use is absent. Exercise frequency is modest (exercising alone 1–2×/week, small positive Z), and health satisfaction is below average (Z ≈ -0.78). Taken together, the self-report profile indicates increased anxiety and disturbed sleep that may exacerbate perceived stress, tempered by relatively low depressive symptoms, reasonable self-esteem and reported happiness.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics emphasize a pattern consistent with circadian misalignment and nocturnal physiological activation. Median sleep onset is very late (≈03:48), although median nightly sleep duration is in the adequate-to-high range (7 h 49 min; Z ≈ 0.79). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is large (SD ≈ 174 minutes; Z ≈ 1.66) and naps are more frequent than average (mean daily naps Z ≈ 1.75), indicating an irregular sleep schedule. Circadian rhythm summary metrics show modest reductions in interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.24) and a small increase in intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.32) — a pattern reflecting less regular and somewhat more fragmented daily rhythms. Resting heart rate and MESOR are both lower than the population average (resting HR = 48.8 bpm, Z ≈ -1.11; MESOR Z ≈ -1.49), suggesting a low baseline cardiovascular tone, which can reflect higher fitness or lower tonic arousal.

Despite a low baseline heart rate, aggregated hourly heart rate deviations reveal noteworthy nocturnal elevations and evening peaks that suggest episodic physiological arousal at times when the participant is likely attempting to sleep. The mean deviation from mesor is substantially elevated overnight (e.g., 12–1am to 3–4am show large positive deviations; 2–3am deviation Z ≈ 4.03 is especially pronounced), and several early-morning hours (4–7am) show negative deviations as the day progresses. These nocturnal positive deviations are positively associated with higher PSS in the provided correlations (several night-hour correlations in the 0.15–0.21 range). The acrophase in the late evening (≈8:48 PM) and elevated evening heart rate deviations are consistent with a delayed schedule and evening physiological activation, both of which can impair sleep consolidation and be associated with greater perceived stress.

Integrative inference about perceived stress: multiple converging signals suggest the participant is more likely to report elevated perceived stress. Supporting evidence for higher PSS includes (1) elevated trait anxiety (STAI), (2) subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI>5) coupled with a highly irregular and delayed sleep schedule (median sleep start ≈03:48, large night-to-night sleep variability, frequent naps), (3) measurable nocturnal heart rate elevations (large positive deviations overnight) and modestly increased intradaily variability, and (4) several physiologic night-hour deviations that correlate positively with PSS. Countervailing evidence for lower perceived stress includes relatively low depressive symptom burden, higher self-reported happiness and self-esteem, adequate median sleep duration, and a low resting heart rate that may reflect cardiovascular fitness. However, the combination of late, irregular sleep timing and nocturnal physiological arousal—along with elevated trait anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep—are patterns that more strongly align with elevated perceived stress in this sample.

Reasoned classification versus the study population: population PSS percentiles place the median at 22 and the 75th percentile at 24 (population mean ≈ 21.6, SD ≈ 3.7). Although a direct PSS score for the participant is not provided, the balance of behavioral and physiological indicators (notably elevated STAI, PSQI-defined disturbed sleep, large sleep timing irregularity and pronounced nocturnal HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS) provide stronger evidence for membership in the higher half of the PSS distribution rather than the lower half. Protective markers (low CES-D, decent sleep duration, higher self-esteem/happiness, low resting HR) mitigate but do not outweigh the cluster of anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, circadian irregularity, and nocturnal physiological activation that are associated with greater perceived stress.

73158,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report profile: The participant reports minimal symptom burden on mood and anxiety measures and generally favorable psychosocial functioning. CES-D is 0 (Z = -1.38) and trait STAI is low (24; Z = -1.71), indicating very low self-reported depressive and trait anxiety symptoms relative to the study sample. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (RSES Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction is above average. Substance use is absent across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, and academic performance is high (GPAs ~3.9), consistent with effective functioning in multiple life domains. Sleep quality by PSQI is in the “good” range (score = 4, Z = -1.26). Overall, these self-report indicators converge on relatively low internalizing symptomatology, positive self-appraisal, and adaptive lifestyle behaviors—factors that typically accompany lower perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiology and activity: Cardiovascular and circadian metrics from the Fitbit indicate a physiologically low-arousal profile and generally structured daily patterns. Resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm; Z = -1.18) and the mesor is lower than average (65.92; Z = -1.10), which is consistent with higher fitness or lower tonic physiological arousal. Nonparametric circadian features show modest interdaily stability (0.39, Z = -0.16) and relatively low intradaily variability (0.44, Z = -0.74), suggesting a moderately stable and consolidated daily activity/rhythm pattern. Cosinor-derived amplitude is near the sample mean and the acrophase around early afternoon (1:01 PM) indicates a typical daytime peak. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions and a marked morning rise (notably large positive deviations at 5–7 AM relative to the sample), consistent with a distinct sleep–wake physiological transition. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat shorter than sample average (6 h 11 min; Z = -1.25) and night-to-night sleep variability is moderate (SD ~105 min), but subjective sleep quality is rated as good and the participant reports no naps.

Integration with perceived stress: Multiple lines of evidence favor placement of this participant in the lower half of perceived stress in the study population. Low scores on depression and trait anxiety measures, elevated self-esteem and happiness, absence of substance use, good subjective sleep quality, and low resting heart rate together indicate lower emotional distress and better physiological regulation than many peers—characteristics typically associated with lower PSS. Wearable circadian metrics do not show marked fragmentation; intradaily variability is below the cohort mean, supporting behavioral regularity rather than the irregularity often linked to higher stress. Factors that could modestly increase perceived stress risk are limited: objectively shorter median sleep duration (≈6.2 h) and some night-to-night variability could contribute to strain for some individuals, and a few small positive correlations (e.g., STAI with PSS r ≈ 0.31) indicate constructs related to stress are relevant, but these do not outweigh the dominant pattern of favorable indicators.

Evidence synthesis for ranking: Evidence for a low/median PSS score (bottom 50) is strong—multiple robust self-report indicators and physiological markers point toward lower perceived stress relative to the cohort. Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50) is minimal; correlations between single wearable features and PSS are small and there are no substantial elevations in depressive or anxiety symptoms, no problematic substance use, and no major circadian dysregulation to support classification in the top half of PSS. Taking a holistic view of the multimodal data, the balance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress level would fall in the bottom half of the study distribution.

45963,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Self-report measures show a profile of elevated internalizing symptoms that align with higher perceived stress. The participant reports a high trait anxiety score (STAI = 62; Z = 2.05) and a moderate-to-elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D = 22; Z = 0.9). Both of these measures have positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28), indicating they are likely contributors to higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is below the cohort mean (RSES = 30; Z = -1.15) and momentary happiness is low (current = 2.0; Z = -1.61), which together suggest reduced subjective resources for coping and a negative affective context that commonly accompanies higher stress appraisals. Subjective sleep quality is also degraded (PSQI = 7; classified as disturbed), a factor that frequently amplifies perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian markers provide convergent evidence of a dysregulated stress-related profile. Resting heart rate is above the sample average (RHR = 68.2 bpm; Z = 1.2), and the cosinor-derived mesor is elevated (MESOR = 81.8; Z = 1.07), consistent with a modestly higher tonic cardiovascular activation. Circadian rhythm measures indicate a weak and blunted rhythm: interdaily stability is low (0.16; Z = -2.06) and amplitude is reduced (4.2; Z = -2.13), implying low day-to-day regularity and reduced daytime–nighttime contrast in heart rate. These circadian features are plausibly related to stress-related physiological dysregulation; in this dataset amplitude and stability metrics are associated with stress-relevant constructs (amplitude r ≈ -0.16, interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show higher-than-mesor values in several daytime hours and relatively large negative deviations in early morning hours; taken together with a late median sleep start time (01:56) and large variability in sleep onset (SD = 215 minutes; Z = 2.89), the wearable pattern suggests irregular sleep–wake timing and altered daily arousal pacing—patterns that commonly co-occur with elevated perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle data supply a mixed picture with some protective behaviors but also markers that do not mitigate stress risk. Academic performance is strong (GPAs 3.61–3.98), and substance use is moderate to low (wine 1–2×/week, beer 1–2×/month, no recreational/non-prescribed drugs). However, social and physical-activity behaviors are limited in ways relevant to stress buffering: the participant reports no solitary exercise (Z = -1.93) and relatively low reports of recreational reading or sedentary hobbies; socializing is moderate (1–2 hours daily). Health satisfaction is low (score 2.56; Z = -1.28), which aligns with the other self-report indicators of reduced well-being. The pattern suggests that while substance-related risk behavior is minimal, reduced regular physical activity, low health satisfaction, disturbed sleep, and high anxiety symptoms converge as lifestyle and psychological contributors to elevated perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and PSS-group assessment: multiple independent data streams (high trait anxiety, elevated depressive symptoms, low self-reported happiness and self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep, elevated resting heart rate, markedly reduced circadian stability and amplitude, and large variability in sleep onset) form a consistent pattern associated with higher perceived stress. Several of these measures have nontrivial positive correlations with PSS in the cohort (notably STAI and CES-D), and the circadian/physiological measures indicate stress-relevant dysregulation rather than resilience. Protective factors (strong GPA, low substance misuse) are present but do not outweigh the convergent indicators of stress. On balance, the evidence supports classifying this participant’s perceived stress as falling in the higher half of the study distribution.

22138,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Self-report measures show a mixed profile with one clear signal relevant to perceived stress: the participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86), a measure that has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31). Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are low-to-average (score = 15, Z = 0.18) and the participant’s self-rated sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) is relatively good compared with the study cohort. Self-esteem is above average (RSES Z = 0.54), which would tend to associate with lower perceived stress in this sample (small negative correlation). Current happiness and health satisfaction are slightly below the sample mean (happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.62), which align with modest associations to higher perceived stress but with smaller effect sizes than trait anxiety.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators also provide a mixed picture. The participant reports socially oriented exercise at a relatively high frequency (exercise with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23) and low recreational drug use; these are generally protective behaviors. Alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2×/week, Z = 0.94) is above average but not extreme. Socializing time is below average while reading and sedentary media use are somewhat elevated; these patterns suggest a schedule with time spent in solitary or quiet activities rather than high levels of social engagement. Academic performance (GPA values) is high, indicating sustained academic functioning during the measurement window.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep metrics indicate reasonably regular circadian organization and adequate sleep quantity. Heart rate cosinor metrics show a clear circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = 0.73) and above-average interdaily stability (Z = 0.5), both of which, in this cohort, trend toward lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate and mesor are slightly elevated (RHR = 60.6 bpm, mesor Z ≈ 0.3–0.5), which has a small positive association with PSS here. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show robust nocturnal declines and daytime peaks (notably late afternoon/evening), consistent with typical sleep–wake physiology rather than sustained nocturnal arousal. Median nightly sleep duration is sufficient (7 h 32 min, Z = 0.43) and the participant reports almost no naps. Two potentially relevant sleep-related observations are the late median sleep start time (~01:15) and above-average variability in sleep start time (start-time SD Z = 0.83); in this sample greater sleep-timing variability is modestly associated with higher PSS.

Integrative interpretation for perceived stress: the strongest individual indicator pointing toward elevated perceived stress is elevated trait anxiety (STAI), which in this dataset is one of the more predictive self-report correlates of PSS. Several physiological and behavioral indicators (good overall sleep duration and quality, regular heart-rate circadian structure, low depressive symptom burden, frequent social exercise) point in the opposite direction toward lower or average perceived stress. Many of the wearable-derived correlations with PSS are small in magnitude; where correlations exist, the participant’s values are often neutral or protective (e.g., high interdaily stability, lower intradaily variability). Weighing the sources holistically, the elevated trait anxiety combined with slightly lower subjective happiness and some late/variable sleep timing provide sufficient evidence to place this participant above the median perceived-stress level in the study population, although not at an extreme level.

31439,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures indicate a pattern of elevated negative affect and sleep disturbance that would be expected to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28) are both above the population mean and show positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28). Subjective sleep quality is nominally disturbed (PSQI = 6) despite a modest negative z-score relative to the sample; PSQI scores above 5 typically reflect clinically meaningful sleep complaints, which can amplify perceived stress. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11) and shows a weak negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), suggesting some psychological resources that could buffer stress, but overall mood- and sleep-related indicators point toward greater perceived stress.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular metrics reinforce the presence of elevated physiological arousal. Resting heart rate (78.2 bpm) and mesor (mean circadian heart rate ~91.4 bpm) are both markedly above the cohort mean (Z ≈ 2.38 for each), consistent with tonic autonomic activation. Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show the expected large nocturnal drops and daytime elevations, with notable daytime peaks (e.g., ~9–10am and ~5–6pm) that coincide with typical active periods. The modest positive correlation between resting heart rate/mesor and PSS (r ≈ 0.14 and r ≈ 0.06, respectively) aligns with the interpretation that elevated cardiovascular tone relates to higher perceived stress for this participant.

Circadian and activity-regularity features provide a more mixed picture. Interdaily stability (0.44, Z = 0.25) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.40, Z = 0.64) indicate a reasonably regular day-to-day structure, while intradaily variability is relatively low (0.37, Z = -1.24), implying less fragmentation of activity across the day. In this cohort, higher intradaily variability is modestly positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), so the participant’s lower variability could be a protective/benign sign against very high perceived stress. Amplitude of the circadian heart-rate rhythm is slightly reduced (Z ≈ -0.5), which can reflect blunted day–night contrast and is sometimes associated with stress or dysregulated rest–activity patterns.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators offer additional context but are not strongly directional. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat below the sample average (≈6 h 41 min, Z ≈ -0.61) with moderate night-to-night variability; shorter sleep and poorer subjective sleep (PSQI) both correlate with higher PSS in general, supporting an interpretation of elevated stress. Alcohol use at ~1–2 times per week is above average for the sample (Z ≈ 1.0), and social/happiness ratings are slightly below average (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; trust Z ≈ -1.42), which together lend modest support to greater psychosocial strain. Exercise frequency is moderate but not high (1–2 times/week), offering limited protective effect.

Weighing convergent evidence: above-average trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, disturbed subjective sleep, elevated resting heart rate and mesor, and modestly lower reported well-being point toward higher perceived stress. Countervailing signs—relatively high self-esteem and preserved regularity of daily rhythms (low intradaily variability, moderate interdaily stability)—suggest some resilience but are not strong enough to offset the other indicators. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with perceived stress in the upper half of the study distribution.

46558,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report measures present a mixed but overall modest clinical signal. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are slightly above the study mean (score = 17, Z = 0.38) and the scale annotation marks the score in a higher-symptom range, which—given a positive CES-D:PSS correlation (r ≈ 0.28)—would modestly increase the likelihood of higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety on the STAI is below the study mean (score = 37, Z = −0.43) and correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), so this lower trait-anxiety score speaks against a high PSS. Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES score = 35, Z = −0.45) but its correlation with PSS is small and inverse (r ≈ −0.15), indicating only a small effect on stress estimation. Subjective well-being indices argue more strongly toward lower perceived stress: current happiness is substantially above the sample mean (score = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and health satisfaction is also elevated (5.33, Z = 0.8). Taken together, self-report instruments produce mixed inputs—mildly elevated depressive symptoms but lower trait anxiety and comparatively high reported happiness and health satisfaction—so the net self-report signal modestly favors average-to-lower perceived stress rather than markedly elevated stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate overall circadian regularity and typical diurnal heart rate structure. Non-parametric rhythm measures (interdaily stability = 0.51, Z = 0.83; 24-hour autocorrelation = 0.41, Z = 0.73) are above the study mean, consistent with a relatively regular daily pattern; these stability measures show small negative correlations with PSS (e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12), suggesting that the participant’s circadian regularity would modestly predict lower perceived stress. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (0.59, Z = 0.32) but not extreme; its modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16) would point weakly toward higher stress if it were more pronounced. Resting heart rate is slightly above the study mean (60.7 bpm, Z = 0.3) but close to typical values (mesor ≈ 73 bpm, Z = −0.09), and the amplitude and mesor do not indicate marked dysregulation. Hourly aggregated deviations show expected nocturnal nadirs (largest negative deviations ~ −17 bpm in early morning) and afternoon/evening peaks, with only small correlations to PSS across hours. Overall, the wearable physiology suggests a relatively regular circadian system with no strong physiological markers that would indicate high perceived stress.

Sleep and daily-behavior metrics further support a lower-to-average stress profile. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 5 minutes (Z = −0.12) with low night-to-night variability (SD = 58 minutes, Z = −0.98) and a low reported PSQI score (5.0, Z = −0.8), collectively indicating adequate and consistent sleep. Median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:14) but relatively stable (start-time SD Z = −0.61); these timing features are behavioral but, given consistent duration and good subjective sleep quality, do not strongly point to elevated stress. Behavioral patterns show low exercise frequency and relatively high sedentary leisure (e.g., video games 2–3 hours, Z = 3.23; sedentary hobby 2–3 hours, Z = 2.01), behaviors that can be associated with poorer stress management in some contexts; however, these habits in this participant coexist with high reported happiness and sleep regularity, and their correlations with PSS in the dataset are small, so their impact on perceived stress estimation is limited.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: indicators that would push toward higher perceived stress (slightly elevated CES-D, low exercise, modest intradaily variability, slightly raised resting heart rate) are generally small in magnitude. Indicators that favor lower or average perceived stress (low STAI, high self-reported happiness, good subjective sleep quality, high interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation) are stronger or more consistent. Correlations provided in the dataset show the largest associations for STAI and CES-D with PSS, and because STAI is below average while CES-D is only mildly elevated, the net effect leans toward average-to-lower perceived stress. Therefore, integrating self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, the participant is more consistent with a PSS score in the bottom half of the study distribution (lower or average perceived stress).

93699,13.0,0.023316062176165803,"Self-report indicators show a mixed but stress-prone profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) is modestly elevated relative to the sample and has a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.32), indicating that stable anxiety proneness is a likely contributor to higher perceived stress. Current depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 8, Z = −0.55) and therefore do not suggest substantial mood-related burden in this participant. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are slightly below the study mean (RSES score = 35, Z = −0.45; Current happiness = 3.0, Z = −0.53), both of which are negatively correlated with PSS (RSES r ≈ −0.16; happiness r ≈ −0.20) and therefore represent modest risk factors for higher perceived stress. Health satisfaction is relatively low (2.78 on a 1–7 scale, Z = −1.11), which may reflect perceived vulnerability or dissatisfaction with physical wellbeing and could modestly amplify stress appraisal.

Behavioral and lifestyle data provide additional context consistent with heightened stress exposure. Sleep quality is notably disturbed (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05), which is commonly associated with greater perceived stress; objective sleep duration is slightly short (median 6 h 51 m, Z = −0.42) and sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 00:59) with moderate night-to-night variability (start time SD ≈ 89 min, Z = 0.14). Physical activity is low (infrequent exercise alone, limited sports participation) and socializing is lower than average, while recreational internet use is unusually high (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.19). These behavioral patterns — poor subjective sleep, later/variable bedtimes, limited regular exercise and social engagement, and heavy internet use — align with known behavioral correlates of elevated perceived stress and have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (internet use r ≈ 0.12; sleep variability r ≈ 0.18).

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics show both stress-linked and resilience-like features. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 64.8 bpm, Z = 0.79) and shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.15), consistent with modestly increased physiological arousal. Cosinor MESOR (≈79.4, Z = 0.74) and several daytime aggregate heart-rate deviations (notably mid-day positive deviations, e.g., 12–1 pm and 12–1 pm deviation Zs ≈ 1.01–1.22) indicate greater mean cardiovascular activity in daytime hours; some early-morning nadirs (large negative deviations overnight) are typical of sleep but specific early-morning deviation correlations with PSS are small-to-moderate and positive (hours around 3–6 am r ≈ 0.19–0.22), implying that nocturnal physiological patterns are somewhat associated with higher perceived stress. At the same time, measures of circadian regularity are relatively strong: interdaily stability (0.51, Z = 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.42, Z = 0.81) are higher-than-average and correlate negatively with PSS (interdaily stability r ≈ −0.11; autocorrelation r ≈ −0.17), suggesting preserved day-to-day circadian structure that may buffer stress-related dysregulation. Intradaily variability is near average (0.53, Z ≈ −0.11) and amplitude is near the mean (Z ≈ 0.14), indicating no pronounced fragmentation of daily heart-rate rhythms.

Integrated interpretation and likely PSS placement. Evidence for higher perceived stress includes disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI Z = 1.05), late and somewhat variable sleep timing, modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.27), elevated resting heart rate (RHR Z = 0.79), low health satisfaction, low momentary happiness, and very high recreational internet use (Z = 2.19). Protective or neutral indicators include low depressive symptom burden (CES-D Z = −0.55), relatively preserved circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation both Z ≈ 0.8), and only modest elevations in trait anxiety. On balance, the pattern is one of moderate psychosocial strain with physiologic arousal and sleep disturbance consistent with increased perceived stress, albeit without strong depressive symptoms and with maintained circadian structure that may limit severity. Considering the relative magnitudes (PSQI and RHR Z-scores > 0.7 and internet use highly elevated), the weight of multimodal evidence is toward higher-than-median perceived stress in this participant.

Self-esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 33; z = -0.73), which is a small risk factor because lower self-esteem is weakly associated with higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.15). Current happiness and health satisfaction are above average (happiness z = 0.55; health satisfaction z = 0.55), and academic performance is strong (GPAs near 4.0), both of which are likely protective against elevated perceived stress. Substance use is minimal and organized social activity through sport/exercise is frequent (exercise with others and sports z-scores 1.23 and 1.58), suggesting structured social support and behavioral resilience that tend to buffer stress.

Sleep and circadian physiology show a combination of strengths and potential stress-relevant vulnerabilities. Objective sleep duration is relatively long (median 8 h 28 min; z = 1.59) with few naps, and sleep timing is centered near midnight (median start ≈ 00:03). Despite sufficient sleep quantity, the PSQI score indicates disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6), which can reflect sleep quality or efficiency issues not captured solely by total duration. Circadian/rhythm-derived metrics reveal reduced interdaily stability (value 0.35; z ≈ -0.49) and elevated intradaily variability (value 0.69; z ≈ 1.02). The combination of lower day-to-day regularity and greater within-day fragmentation of heart-rate rhythms has been associated in the literature with greater stress and poorer self-regulation; in this dataset intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16). Resting heart rate and mesor are lower than average (RHR 51.4 bpm z ≈ -0.8; mesor 63.1 z ≈ -1.48), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness, which is typically protective.

Time-of-day physiological arousal is heterogeneous and may reflect lifestyle structure and evening activation. Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected large negative deviations overnight and early morning (e.g., 3–7 AM values well below mesor), but a pronounced positive deviation in the late evening (8–9 PM: +22 bpm; z ≈ 2.19) and notable midday peaks (1–2 PM: +14.3 bpm; z ≈ 0.99). Elevated evening arousal could indicate concentrated evening activity, social/exertional periods, or circadian phase characteristics that may impair subjective sleep quality despite long sleep duration. Most hourly deviations have small correlations with PSS, though the high evening deviation is an outlier in magnitude and may plausibly contribute to disturbed subjective sleep and elevated stress perception for some individuals.

Integrated interpretation and weighting of evidence for perceived stress. Evidence consistent with lower or average perceived stress: low depressive symptoms (CES-D), long objective sleep duration, low resting heart rate and mesor (suggesting fitness), high frequency of organized exercise and sports (z > 1), minimal substance use, above-average happiness and health satisfaction, and strong academic performance. Evidence consistent with elevated perceived stress: modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; r with PSS ≈ 0.31), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), circadian rhythm fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ 1.02) and reduced interdaily stability, lower self-esteem (z ≈ -0.73), and patterns of elevated evening physiological arousal (8–9 PM peak). Taken together, the profile is mixed but leans toward a modestly elevated perceived stress level: protective behavioral and physiological indicators are present (fitness, exercise, academic success, low depressive symptoms), yet several stress-relevant signals (trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep despite long sleep time, circadian fragmentation, lower self-esteem, evening arousal) are likely to increase perceived stress relative to peers. Because trait anxiety and circadian fragmentation have consistent positive associations with PSS in this dataset and the participant shows clear elevations on those axes, the balance of evidence favors placement in the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress, though not extreme.

88008,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Summary and overall interpretation:
The participant’s profile presents a mixed pattern of signals. Self-report measures of affect and trait anxiety are elevated (CES-D = 20, Z ≈ 0.7; STAI–Trait = 48, Z ≈ 0.66) and these measures show the largest positive correlations with PSS in the available dataset (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), indicating that mood and anxiety symptoms are likely contributors to higher perceived stress. At the same time, objective wearable-derived indicators of daily structure and physiological regulation—high interdaily stability (IS value = 0.52, Z ≈ 0.91), low intradaily variability (IV = 0.30, Z ≈ -1.73), a relatively large circadian amplitude (15.36, Z ≈ 1.48), and a modestly low resting heart rate (55.1 bpm, Z ≈ -0.36)—are consistent with a well-entrained circadian profile and relatively good cardiovascular fitness, features typically associated with lower stress or better stress resilience. Weighing these domains together suggests a participant with affective symptom burden but preserved behavioral regularity and fitness; the affective signals point toward elevated perceived stress, while the behavioral/physiological signals are somewhat protective.

Self-report mental health and psychosocial functioning:
Mood and anxiety indicators are the most salient self-report risk signals. The CES-D score (20) reaches the range commonly interpreted as elevated depressive symptoms and the STAI–Trait score (48) indicates above-average trait anxiety; both are positive correlates of PSS in this sample. Self-esteem is below the study mean (Rosenberg = 33, Z ≈ -0.73) and momentary happiness is somewhat reduced (current happiness Z ≈ -0.53); both of these are weak negative correlates of PSS, such that lower self-regard and lower positive affect are consistent with increased perceived stress. Substance use is minimal and health satisfaction is modestly below average, which moderates the overall psychosocial risk profile but does not offset the elevated mood/anxiety signals.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular features:
Cardiac circadian metrics point to a robust and regular pattern. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are above-average (IS Z ≈ 0.9; autocorrelation Z ≈ 0.73) and intradaily variability is markedly low (Z ≈ -1.73), indicating consistent day-to-day timing and fewer abrupt activity/rest transitions. The large amplitude and a late-evening acrophase (~5:06 PM) further reflect a strong daily rhythm in heart rate. Resting heart rate is relatively low, consistent with fitness. These features are generally associated with better physiological regulation and, in this dataset, tend to correlate modestly in the direction of lower perceived stress (amplitude and IS have negative correlations with PSS in the sample). Therefore, the wearable metrics provide objective evidence of circadian regularity and physiological reserve that would typically buffer perceived stress.

Sleep timing and quantity:
Sleep behavior shows a pattern of late sleep timing and somewhat short duration. Median sleep duration is 6 hours 9 minutes (Z ≈ -1.29), and median sleep start time is late (~1:14 AM), with modest night-to-night variability. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z ≈ -0.8) is at or just below the common clinical cutoff and is measured here as relatively good versus the study population. Short sleep duration and late timing can be associated with increased stress and reduced recovery, but in this profile the objective circadian regularity and low intradaily fragmentation suggest the participant maintains consistent timing even if it is late and relatively short. The correlations between the sleep metrics and PSS in the provided dataset are small-to-negligible, so sleep contributes some risk but is not the dominant signal.

Integrated assessment relevant to perceived stress (PSS):
The strongest direct evidence for elevated perceived stress comes from self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample and are elevated for this participant (Z ≈ +0.7 each). Countervailing evidence from objective data—regular circadian rhythms, low intradaily variability, relatively high amplitude, frequent exercise, low substance use, and a low resting heart rate—suggest behavioral and physiological resilience that are associated with lower PSS. Overall, because the most PSS-relevant features (CES-D and STAI) are elevated and are among the better predictors of PSS in the dataset, the balance of evidence favors placement in the higher half of the PSS distribution, albeit not necessarily at the extreme upper tail. In summary, the integrated multimodal profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level in the top 50% of the study population.

83566,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological profile:
The self-report measures show pronounced elevations in internalizing symptomatology that are relevant to perceived stress. The participant's CES-D score (37; z = +2.47) and trait anxiety (STAI = 62; z = +2.05) are both well above the study mean and indicate a substantial burden of depressive and anxiety symptoms relative to peers. Concurrently, global self-reported happiness and self-esteem are below the sample mean (happiness current = 2.0, z = −1.61; Rosenberg self-esteem = 29, z = −1.29). These patterns (high depressive and anxiety symptoms with low positive affect and self-regard) are commonly associated with heightened subjective stress and greater sensitivity to daily hassles, and both CES-D and STAI scores show positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), supporting their relevance to perceived stress here.

Paragraph 2 — Sleep and daily routine (subjective and wearable):
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 8 m; z = +1.18) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD 65 min; z = −0.82). However, subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI = 8; z ≈ +0.59), suggesting longer sleep quantity that is experienced as non-restorative. The median sleep onset time is late (≈ 01:52), with moderate consistency (sleep start SD ≈ 66 min; z ≈ −0.37), indicating a late-night chronotype but with some nightly regularity. The absence of naps and low daytime recreational/social activity suggest limited daytime recuperative or social buffering behaviors. Taken together, objective regularity in sleep timing does not appear to translate to good perceived sleep quality, a mismatch that often co-occurs with elevated stress and affective symptoms.

Paragraph 3 — Physiological and circadian markers from wearable data:
Cardiovascular markers show a modestly elevated tonic profile: resting heart rate is higher than the sample mean (69.4 bpm; z = +1.34) and the MESOR of the cosinor model is elevated (MESOR = 84.8; z = +1.49). Amplitude is near average (z ≈ +0.27) and the acrophase (peak cardiac activity) is late-afternoon (~4:51 PM). Non-parametric rhythm metrics are close to the cohort mean (interdaily stability ≈ 0.42, z ≈ +0.09) with slightly elevated intradaily variability (0.58, z ≈ +0.24). The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime elevations, with the deepest relative troughs in the early morning and peaks in the afternoon. Elevated resting heart rate and modestly elevated MESOR are physiologically consistent with chronic sympathetic arousal or reduced parasympathetic tone and have small positive associations with perceived stress in the sample, reinforcing the self-report indicators.

Paragraph 4 — Behavior, social context, and protective factors:
There are several behavioral features with potential buffering effects against stress, but they appear limited. Academic performance is good (GPAs 3.5–3.67), and substance use is minimal (reported “not at all” for alcohol and drugs), which reduce some stress risk. However, exercise frequency is very low (1–2 times per month when alone; z ≈ −0.43) and socializing durations are low (≈31 minutes/hour; z ≈ −0.62), reducing common behavioral resources for stress regulation. Health satisfaction is slightly below average (z ≈ −0.37). Overall, the paucity of social and physical-activity resources suggests fewer behavioral buffers to mitigate perceived stress despite intact academic functioning.

Paragraph 5 — Integration and PSS group assignment:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the balance favors an elevated perceived stress profile. Strong indicators for higher PSS include markedly elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores (large positive z-scores for CES-D and STAI), low happiness and self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep despite long objective sleep, and physiological signs of heightened tonic cardiac index (resting HR, MESOR). Protective signals that could indicate lower perceived stress — such as consistent sleep timing, no substance use, and preserved GPA — are present but relatively limited in scope and do not offset the magnitude of the affective and physiological elevations. Correlations in the dataset link depressive and anxiety measures with PSS and the participant’s symptom magnitudes are sizeable relative to peers. On balance, the overall profile is more consistent with placement in the top half of the study population for perceived stress.

87032,26.0,0.927461139896373,"Summary of self-report psychological profile:
The participant endorses elevated self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D = 28; Z = 1.53) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27). Self-esteem is slightly below the study mean (RSES = 36; Z = -0.31). Subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52), and general health satisfaction is below average (Z = -0.53). Academic performance (GPA ~3.44–3.5) is within a typical range, and substance use is minimal. Together, these survey indicators point toward concurrent affective symptoms and disrupted subjective sleep that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress in student samples.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns:
Daily behavior is marked by low physical activity and relatively sedentary leisure: the participant reports essentially no regular exercise or sports (exercise Z-scores roughly -1.6 to -1.9) while reporting high time spent on internet use and listening to music (Z ≈ 2.1–2.2). Watching video content is also above average (Z = 1.91). Socializing time is near average. Reading shows an elevated Z (2.28), suggesting substantial time allocated to that sedentary activity as well. This constellation (low active behaviors, high sedentary and screen-based activities) is consistent with behavioral patterns that can amplify perceived stress and disturb sleep/wake schedules.

Sleep timing and variability:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate late and irregular sleep timing and somewhat short sleep duration. Median sleep onset is around 02:00 AM with a large night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 145 minutes; Z = 1.36). Median nightly sleep duration is under seven hours (6h43m; Z = -0.58). Mean daily nap frequency is low but non-zero (0.18/day; Z = 1.27), possibly reflecting compensatory daytime rest. The combination of subjectively poor sleep (high PSQI) with late, variable bedtimes and suboptimal duration supports sleep-related contributors to elevated perceived stress.

Circadian and heart-rate physiology:
Cardiovascular circadian markers show reduced regularity and greater within-day fragmentation: interdaily stability is low (0.27; Z = -1.15) while intradaily variability is elevated (0.75; Z = 1.44), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -1.87). These collectively indicate a relatively irregular circadian structure of heart-rate rhythms across the recording period. Mean heart-rate level is higher than the cohort average (MESOR ≈ 85.4 bpm, Z = 1.56) and resting heart rate is elevated (69.4 bpm; Z = 1.34). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal reductions and daytime elevations, with the acrophase in mid-afternoon (≈ 4:28 PM). Slightly elevated mesor and resting HR together with circadian irregularity are physiological signatures that have modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample (resting HR r ≈ 0.13; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15).

Integration with perceived stress:
Converging lines of evidence point toward relatively elevated perceived stress for this participant. Key contributors are: elevated depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep quality, late and irregular sleep timing, low physical activity, and physiologic indices of higher tonic heart rate and circadian irregularity. Several of these features (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, poor sleep, circadian fragmentation, higher resting HR) are each positively associated with perceived stress in this cohort and are present at magnitudes above typical values (notably CES-D and PSQI Z-scores ≈ +1.5; MESOR/resting HR Z-scores > +1). Countervailing indications for low or average PSS are limited: stable academic performance and minimal substance use reduce some stress-related risk, and self-esteem is only modestly below average. However, the balance of survey and wearable signals supports placement above the sample median for perceived stress.

Conclusion — PSS group:
Based on the overall pattern of affective symptoms, disrupted sleep and circadian measures, sedentary behavior, and elevated heart rate measures that align with higher PSS correlations in this population, the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the study population on perceived stress.

94641,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures indicate a profile consistent with elevated affective burden and sleep disturbance. The participant’s CES-D score (29; Z = 1.63) and STAI–Trait score (54; Z = 1.25) are both well above the study mean and are the strongest questionnaire correlates with perceived stress in this dataset (CES-D r = 0.28; STAI r = 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52), and self-esteem is somewhat lower than average (Rosenberg = 32; Z = -0.87). Health satisfaction is also low (Z = -1.61), which may reflect perceived limitations in physical well‑being. These self-reported affective and sleep complaints provide direct psychological signals that commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral self-reports describe a lifestyle pattern that could be sustaining or exacerbating stress-related symptoms. The participant reports essentially no exercise (exercise frequencies with Z-scores as low as -1.93), very low socializing (15 minutes or less; Z = -2.20), and prominent engagement in sedentary solitary activities (sedentary hobby >4 hours, Z = 3.19; video games 1–2 hours, Z = 2.47). Substance use is minimal (alcohol and drug use Z-scores < 0), and academic performance appears strong (GPAs ~3.7–3.8). The combination of low social support/interaction and low physical activity alongside high sedentary time aligns with behavioral patterns that are often associated with greater perceived stress and poorer mood.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep metrics support the self-report indications of physiological arousal and disrupted sleep–wake functioning. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the study sample (70.3 bpm; Z = 1.44; r with PSS = 0.14) and the fitted mesor from cosinor analysis is likewise above average (83.09; Z = 1.25), suggesting a higher tonic cardiovascular level during the recording period. Nighttime heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal decline but with an overall mesor offset consistent with the higher resting rate. Circadian regularity signals are mixed: interdaily stability is near average (0.42; Z = 0.09) while autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (Z = 1.15), and intradaily variability is modestly lower than average (Z = -0.53). Objective sleep duration is somewhat short (median 6 hr 15 min; Z = -1.15) and sleep timing is variable (sleep duration SD = 168 min; Z = 1.52), both of which are features that tend to correlate with greater stress (sleep variability r ≈ 0.14). The participant also shows relatively frequent short naps (mean daily naps 0.3; Z = 2.66), which may reflect compensatory sleep behavior.

Weighing evidence for group placement on perceived stress: indicators supporting higher perceived stress (top 50%) are robust and multi-modal — elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both moderately correlated with PSS), poor subjective sleep, elevated resting heart rate/mesor, large night-to-night sleep variability, low social activity and physical exercise, and low health satisfaction. Some factors could temper this interpretation (minimal substance use, intact academic performance, and a slightly above-average momentary happiness rating), but these are less directly correlated with PSS in this dataset than the symptom-sleep-physiology cluster. On balance, the preponderance of self-report and wearable signals that are known correlates of perceived stress indicate that this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of the study distribution for PSS.

82728,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Psychological trait and self-report profile: The participant’s self-report instruments show low-to-average symptom burden on measures that commonly co-vary with perceived stress. The CES-D score of 11 (z = -0.24) and the STAI–Trait score of 39 (z = -0.23) are both slightly below the study mean, indicating relatively modest depressive and trait-anxiety symptom levels compared with peers. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 37, z = -0.17 relative to the sample direction), while current self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are modestly lower than the study mean (happiness z = -0.53; health satisfaction z = -0.45). Taken together, these self-report indicators point toward generally adaptive affective and personality resources (low anxiety/depression, adequate self-esteem) with some reduced subjective well-being and health satisfaction that could reflect transient concerns but do not by themselves indicate elevated chronic stress.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle: The participant reports minimal substance use across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs (z-scores between -0.11 and -1.30), and relatively frequent individual exercise (exercised alone three times per week or more; z = 1.07). Social and sedentary recreational activities are low-to-moderate (short durations of TV, music, internet use, and limited time spent socializing or on sedentary hobbies). The combination of low substance use and regular exercise is typically associated with more effective behavioral coping and lower perceived stress; these behaviors therefore provide evidence consistent with lower perceived stress in the study population.

Sleep subjectively and objectively: Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 59 minutes (z = -0.25), with low nap frequency (mean daily naps = 0, z = -0.86). Night-to-night variability in sleep start time and duration is moderate (SDs ~93 minutes and 92 minutes; z-scores near zero), indicating some variability but not pronounced irregularity. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7; z = 0.13) crosses the commonly used threshold for disturbed sleep and suggests the participant experiences sleep difficulties despite an objectively near-7-hour median duration. Correlations provided show only small associations between these sleep metrics and PSS in this sample, but the pattern—objectively adequate duration with subjective disturbance—may index sleep-related complaints that can modestly influence perceived stress even when global symptom scores are low.

Circadian structure and cardiovascular activity: Heart rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively robust and regular physiological rhythm. Interdaily stability is above average (0.50; z = 0.75) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is markedly elevated (z = 1.06), while intradaily variability is lower than typical (z = -0.53). Amplitude of the cosinor fit is large (15.56; z = 1.54), and the MESOR and resting heart rate are near or slightly above the sample mean (MESOR z = 0.35; RHR 60.2 bpm, z = 0.24). Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and daytime increases, with a pronounced late-afternoon/early-evening HR elevation (peak ~5–6 pm; z = 2.47) consistent with daily activity or exercise. Within the sample correlations, stronger rhythmicity and greater amplitude trend toward lower PSS (amplitude r ≈ -0.17; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12). This profile—regular day-to-day heart rate patterns, low fragmentation, and a high amplitude diurnal rhythm—aligns with physiological markers typically associated with better regulation and lower perceived stress.

Synthesis regarding perceived stress (PSS): Multiple convergent indicators point toward a PSS score in the lower half of the study distribution. Psychological symptom measures that commonly reflect stress-related distress (CES-D, STAI-Trait) are below the sample mean, and behavioral markers of adaptive coping (regular exercise, very low substance use) are relatively strong. Physiological circadian features demonstrate robust, regular rhythms (high interdaily stability and amplitude, high 24-h autocorrelation, low intradaily variability), and these wearable-derived features show small negative correlations with PSS in this sample, consistent with lower perceived stress. Countervailing signals include a PSQI score indicating subjective sleep disturbance and somewhat reduced self-reported happiness and health satisfaction; however, these are modest in magnitude and are not accompanied by increased depressive or anxiety symptoms or by physiological dysregulation. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (psychological, behavioral, and wearable physiological markers) supports classification in the bottom half of the population distribution for perceived stress.

45076,29.0,0.9715025906735751,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports modest elevation in trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z ≈ 0.27) and slightly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 15, Z ≈ 0.18), both of which are positively correlated with perceived stress in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28). At the same time, self-esteem is notably high relative to the sample (RSES Z ≈ 1.38), a trait that in this dataset is modestly associated with lower perceived stress (r ≈ -0.16). Momentary well-being indicators are mixed: current happiness and health satisfaction are below sample means (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95), suggesting some subjective dissatisfaction that can co-occur with stress but are only weakly correlated with PSS in the provided correlations. Overall, the self-report symptom profile shows mild elevations on anxiety and depressive symptom scales but also a relatively strong sense of self-worth; these features point to some internal tension but not a large signal of pervasive symptom burden.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: The participant endorses frequent physical activity (exercising alone and with others, and sports three times per week or more; exercise Z-scores range ~1.07–1.58), low recreational substance use, limited recreational screen time, and strong academic performance (GPA consistently ~3.5–3.7). These behaviors are conventionally protective against high perceived stress and negative affect and are supported here by small correlations in the expected directions (e.g., exercise correlations near zero to modest negative). Socializing time is moderate (1–2 hours), and daily sedentary hobby time is low to modest. In sum, lifestyle and functional metrics provide multiple factors that would be expected to buffer perceived stress.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-derived sleep shows a median sleep duration of ~7 h 38 m (Z ≈ 0.56) with modest night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 96 minutes, Z ≈ -0.10). Despite objectively adequate sleep duration, the PSQI indicates subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed sleep). This dissociation—good objective duration but poorer subjective quality—can be associated with stress or sleep fragmentation. Circadian rhythm features show relatively low interdaily stability (value 0.32, Z ≈ -0.74) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (value 0.59, Z ≈ 0.32), indicating some day-to-day irregularity and within-day fragmentation of heart-rate patterns. The cosinor amplitude is slightly reduced (amplitude Z ≈ -0.44) while autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively strong (Z ≈ 0.81), suggesting an overall identifiable daily rhythm but with lower amplitude and somewhat irregular timing across days.

Physiological arousal and timing of activity: Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.8 bpm, Z ≈ -0.04), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and/or a generally low baseline physiologic arousal. Hourly heart-rate deviations from the mesor show large positive deviations in the mid- to late-afternoon (notably 3–5 pm, with the 4–5 pm window Z ≈ 2.40) and secondary elevations in the evening (≈8–9 pm). Overnight and early-morning hours exhibit pronounced negative deviations (e.g., 2–6 am ≈ -15 bpm). The afternoon peaks align temporally with likely exercise or athletic activity (participant reports sports/exercise multiple times per week), supporting an interpretation that these are activity-related increases rather than sustained stress-related sympathetic arousal. Correlations of these hourly deviations with PSS are small and mostly negative or near zero, providing limited direct evidence linking these HR patterns to perceived stress in this participant.

Integration and inference regarding perceived stress: Evidence for elevated perceived stress is present but modest: trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are slightly above the sample mean and correlate positively with PSS, and subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed. Against that, there are multiple indicators suggestive of lower or average perceived stress: high self-esteem, frequent exercise and sports participation, low resting heart rate, adequate objective sleep duration, low substance use, and strong academic performance. Circadian metrics are mixed (some irregularity but clear daily rhythm), and many wearable-derived metrics show only weak correlations with PSS in the sample. Taken holistically, the balance of protective behavioral factors and physiological indicators appears stronger than the modest elevations in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Therefore, it is more likely that this participant’s PSS score falls at or below the sample median rather than in the upper half of the distribution.

44872,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological self-report profile:
The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and a trait anxiety score close to the study mean (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23). Self-esteem and momentary well-being are elevated (Rosenberg self‑esteem Z = 0.68; current happiness Z = 1.64), and overall health satisfaction is high (score = 6, Z = 1.3). Academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.8–3.93). Together, these survey indicators point toward a generally adaptive psychological profile with relatively low affective symptom burden and positive self-evaluations—features that typically accompany lower perceived stress.

Lifestyle and behavioral context:
The participant reports frequent socializing (2–3 hours, Z = 0.95) and regular exercise (three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.1–1.2 for exercising alone/with others), and minimal recreational drug use. Alcohol use is more frequent than average (beer and wine/liquor reported three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.7), but correlations between alcohol variables and PSS in this dataset are negligible. Engagement in passive media and sedentary hobbies is below cohort averages. Overall, the behavioral profile suggests good social support and physical activity levels—factors associated with reduced perceived stress—although the relatively frequent alcohol use is a potential coping-related behavior to monitor.

Sleep and circadian regularity:
Subjective sleep quality crosses the common threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6), though its Z-score is slightly below the cohort mean (Z = -0.33). Median nightly sleep duration is just under 7 hours (6 h 58 m, Z = -0.27), with pronounced night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 135 minutes, Z = 0.77) and notably irregular sleep timing (median start ~23:39 with start-time SD Z = 1.55). These objective variability metrics correlate modestly with higher PSS in the cohort (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.17; sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.14). In sum, sleep quantity is near normative but fragmented and irregular, a pattern that can contribute to elevated perceived stress even when overall symptom measures are low.

Wearable-derived physiological and activity patterns:
Resting heart rate is low relative to the cohort (48.3 bpm, Z = -1.17), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude are also on the lower side (mesor Z = -1.65; amplitude Z ≈ -0.13), while acrophase is mid‑afternoon (≈2:42 PM). Nonparametric circadian metrics indicate reduced interdaily stability (value 0.29, Z = -0.99) and modestly elevated intradaily variability (value 0.61, Z = 0.46), suggesting fragmented day–night structure of activity/physiology. Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs and large daytime peaks (notably mid‑day and early evening peaks with several very high positive Z-scores), reflecting concentrated daytime activity. These wearable indices point to a relatively well-conditioned cardiovascular state but with less regular daily rhythmicity—physiological features that, in this dataset, show small correlations with higher PSS.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Most robust indicators—low depressive symptoms, near-average trait anxiety, elevated self-esteem and happiness, high health satisfaction, regular exercise, strong academic performance, and a low resting heart rate—collectively point toward lower perceived stress relative to the study population. Countervailing evidence includes subjective sleep disturbance, substantial variability in sleep timing and duration, and reduced interdaily stability/increased intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythms; these features are modestly associated with higher PSS in the cohort and could reflect lifestyle irregularity that increases stress vulnerability. However, the magnitude and consistency of the positive psychosocial and fitness indicators appear stronger than the circadian/sleep irregularities, and the correlations of most wearable metrics with PSS are small.

Conclusion (PSS group):
On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the cohort distribution for perceived stress (bottom 50%), although there are specific sleep and rhythm-related risk features that could elevate stress if they worsen.

27306,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a profile consistent with relatively low affective symptom burden and protective psychosocial resources. The participant’s CES-D score is low (6; Z = -0.76) and the STAI–Trait score is below the sample mean (37; Z = -0.43), both pointing to infrequent depressive symptoms and relatively low trait anxiety compared with peers. Self-esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 1.66) and self-rated health satisfaction is high (6.67 on a 1–7 scale; Z = 1.8), which together are normally associated with greater perceived coping capacity and lower appraisals of stress. Sleep quality by self-report is classified as “good” (PSQI = 4; Z = -1.26). Lifestyle reports further support lower stress risk: regular exercise (three times per week or more, Z > 1 for both solo and group exercise), minimal recreational substance use, and low time spent on sedentary leisure or internet use. Taken together, the survey profile suggests a constellation of low symptom burden and behavioral resources that typically buffer perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian data reinforce the interpretation of lower baseline physiological arousal and generally regular sleep timing. Resting heart rate is low (46.2 bpm; Z = -1.42) and the heart-rate mesor is also below the sample mean (63.03 bpm; Z = -1.49), consistent with relatively high cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic sympathetic activation. Median nightly sleep duration (6 h 42 m; Z = -0.6) is modestly below the sample mean but within a common range for students, and night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is not elevated (sleep start SD ~57 min, Z = -0.57; duration SD 84 min, Z = -0.37). Circadian summary features show moderate structure but slight irregularity: interdaily stability is near average-to-low (0.38; Z = -0.24) while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.59; Z = 0.32), suggesting some daytime fragmentation of activity/heart rate though not extreme. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations display expected nocturnal troughs and pronounced daytime peaks (notably an afternoon peak around 4–5pm), consistent with concentrated daytime activity rather than persistent nocturnal arousal.

When integrating survey and wearable information with respect to perceived stress, the balance of evidence favors lower-than-average perceived stress within this sample. Key indicators that commonly covary with higher perceived stress — elevated depressive symptoms, high trait anxiety, poor subjective sleep quality, irregular sleep timing, greater substance use, and elevated resting heart rate — are largely absent. Correlations provided in the dataset between several measures and PSS are modest in magnitude (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), and the participant’s scores on those predictors are mostly on the favorable side of the distribution. There are minor signs of circadian fragmentation (slightly elevated intradaily variability) and slightly shorter median sleep, but these are small effects relative to the protective profile (high self-esteem, good health satisfaction, frequent exercise, low resting HR). Therefore the overall multimodal pattern points toward relatively low or at most average perceived stress.

Evidence for elevated perceived stress (top half of the distribution) is limited in this case. While a few wearable features (small positive intradaily variability, and some hourly deviations that weakly correlate with PSS) could be interpreted as small stress-related physiological variability, these signals are weak and counterbalanced by robust indicators of low symptom burden and adaptive behaviors. Conversely, multiple independent indicators supporting lower stress (low CES-D, lower STAI, good PSQI, high self-esteem, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, low substance use) collectively provide stronger evidence for membership in the lower half of the PSS distribution.

46365,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Psychological trait and self-report indicators present a mixed but informative profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) is moderately elevated and correlates positively with PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.31), indicating a disposition toward greater perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D is low-to-moderate (score = 12, Z = -0.14) and shows a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), suggesting that mood symptoms are present but not prominent. Self-esteem is at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), which may buffer stress perception. Subjective happiness is slightly below the cohort mean (current = 3.0, Z = -0.53), and self-rated health satisfaction is notably low (2.33, Z = -1.45), the latter indicating a specific domain of dissatisfaction that can contribute to perceived stress independent of mood scales.

Behavioral and lifestyle data show frequent late-night social and digital engagement alongside regular alcohol consumption. The participant reports extensive socializing (>4 hours daily; Z = 2.53) and high internet use (>4 hours; Z = 2.19). Alcohol use (beer three times per week or more; Z = 1.72) is elevated relative to peers. Exercise frequency is low for solitary and partnered exercise but sports participation is moderate (1–2 times/week; Z = 0.91). These behaviors have small correlations with PSS in the dataset (internet use, socializing weakly positive; sports weakly negative), suggesting these habits may modestly increase perceived stress or reflect coping strategies for stress rather than being primary drivers of high stress on their own.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures indicate adequate total sleep time but a delayed and somewhat irregular schedule with nocturnal physiological arousal. Median nightly sleep duration is healthy (7 h 16 min, Z = 0.11) and the PSQI score is at the cutoff for good sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). However, median sleep start time is late (01:34 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 62 min). Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (both Z ≲ -0.9 to -1.37), indicating a schedule that is less tightly entrained to a 24-hour pattern compared with peers. Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations reveal elevated cardiovascular activity in the late evening and near-midnight hours (e.g., 10–11pm and 11pm–12am Z-scores ≈ +1.3 to +1.8), with a pronounced nadir in the early morning. This pattern is consistent with late-night behavioral activation (socializing, internet use, alcohol) producing elevated physiological arousal at times when peers are more likely to be winding down.

Integrated interpretation with respect to perceived stress: evidence points toward a modestly elevated stress burden rather than a uniformly low-stress profile. The strongest stress-related signals are elevated trait anxiety (STAI), low health satisfaction, and behavioral patterns (frequent late-night social/internet activity and elevated alcohol use) that coincide with nighttime physiological arousal on wearables. These indicators are supported by modest cohort-level correlations with PSS. Offsetting factors include adequate sleep duration and low depressive symptoms, strong self-esteem, and a relatively low resting heart rate, each of which are associated with lower perceived stress or resilience in the cohort. On balance, the presence of trait anxiety and multiple behavioral/physiological markers of late-night arousal and health-related dissatisfaction outweigh the protective signals, making it more likely that the participant’s PSS score falls in the upper half of the study distribution.

23287,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report profile and psychological traits:
The participant’s self-report profile is characterized by generally low scores on symptom measures and broadly positive health-related self-evaluations. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43) are below the study mean, and self-esteem is near the cohort average (RSES Z = -0.03). Subjective sleep quality is relatively good (PSQI = 3, Z = -1.72) and overall health satisfaction is high (Z = 1.71). Recreational substance use is essentially absent and the participant reports exercising frequently with others (3+ times/week, Z = 1.23). Together these self-report indicators point toward lower symptom burden, preserved psychosocial resources (e.g., trust, exercise engagement), and generally favorable subjective health — patterns that, in this sample, are more consistent with lower perceived stress.

Paragraph 2 — Wearable-derived resting physiology and circadian summary:
Physiological markers derived from the Fitbit indicate low tonic cardiovascular arousal: resting heart rate (40.6 bpm) and mesor (57.82) are both markedly below the study mean (Z ≈ -2.1 and -2.2, respectively). Low resting heart rate and low mesor typically reflect higher cardiorespiratory fitness and/or lower baseline sympathetic tone, a profile that is usually associated with reduced stress reactivity and lower perceived stress in population samples. Circadian rhythm structure is intact: amplitude is modestly above average (Z = 0.56) and interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.3–0.5), consistent with a relatively regular daily rhythm. Non-parametric intradaily variability is only slightly elevated (Z = 0.17). Overall the aggregated circadian features point to a coherent, fairly regular rhythm rather than a strongly dysregulated pattern.

Paragraph 3 — Hourly heart-rate deviations, evening physiology, and behavioral context:
Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations from the mesor show large nocturnal decreases and pronounced daytime/evening increases. Overnight hours (roughly 1–7 AM) show strong negative deviations (largest Z-magnitude), consistent with consolidated nocturnal low heart rate during sleep. The largest positive deviations are in the late evening (notably 9–11 PM; Z > 2 for 9–11 PM), which aligns with a median sleep-start time near 00:56 and elevated evening wake/activity. This evening elevation may reflect late-night behavioral engagement (the participant reports above-average internet use, Z = 1.52) rather than chronic physiological arousal. Critically, these evening heart-rate peaks occur against a backdrop of very low resting heart rate and robust amplitude, limiting their implication as evidence of widespread physiological stress.

Paragraph 4 — Sleep quantity and variability:
Objective sleep duration is greater than average (median 8 h 23 m, Z = 1.49), and subjective sleep quality is reported as good (PSQI Z = -1.72). The participant does exhibit above-average variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 130 minutes, Z = 0.67) and a somewhat elevated mean nap frequency (0.25 naps/day, Z = 2.07), which could reflect occasional compensatory sleep behavior. However, subjective sleep quality and longer median duration, together with the strong nocturnal heart-rate decline, suggest generally adequate restorative sleep for this individual. Small positive correlations in the dataset between sleep variability and perceived stress warrant noting but are not dominant signals here.

Paragraph 5 — Behavioral patterns relevant to perceived stress:
Behavioral indicators present a mixed but overall low-stress pattern. Regular social exercise and low substance use are protective features, while limited daily face-to-face socializing time (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41) and moderate internet use (3–4 hours, Z = 1.52) are potential stress-linked behaviors in some contexts. Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z = -0.53), but given the low depression/anxiety scores, high health satisfaction, and fitness-related physiology, this is more suggestive of transient mood variation than sustained high perceived stress.

Paragraph 6 — Weighing evidence for PSS placement:
Evidence consistent with a lower PSS score: low CES-D and STAI, strong subjective sleep quality, long median sleep duration, very low resting heart rate and mesor, moderately high circadian amplitude and stability, and frequent exercise — all features that, in this cohort, tend to align with lower perceived stress. Evidence that might indicate higher PSS (less persuasive here): modest sleep-duration variability, somewhat elevated intradaily variability, higher internet use, and evening heart-rate elevations associated with a late sleep onset; these signals are small in magnitude or plausibly explained by lifestyle (late bedtimes but adequate total sleep) rather than chronic stress. Correlations between many of these features and PSS in the cohort are small in absolute value, and the strongest consistent pattern across modalities points toward lower perceived stress relative to the study population.

Conclusion — PSS group assignment:
Integrating self-report, behavioral, and physiological evidence, the balance of data indicates the participant’s perceived stress is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution. The combination of low symptom scores, favorable subjective health and sleep, low resting cardiovascular tone, and generally regular circadian structure supports classification in the bottom 50% for PSS within this cohort.

28247,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant reports elevated internalizing symptoms that are strongly relevant to perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden is high (CES-D = 29, Z = 1.63) and trait anxiety is markedly elevated (STAI = 61, Z = 1.95); both scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r = 0.28; STAI r = 0.31), indicating these measures are meaningful predictors of higher perceived stress in this cohort. Self-esteem is below average (RSES score = 31, Z = -1.01) and correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.15), consistent with the expectation that lower self-worth is associated with greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is worse than average (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59), which also aligns with higher stress in many samples. Together, these self-report indicators—particularly the combination of high anxiety and depressive symptoms—constitute the clearest psychological signals pointing toward elevated perceived stress.

Sleep timing and circadian regularity: Wearable-derived sleep and circadian markers show patterns often associated with distress and dysregulated daily structure. Median nocturnal sleep duration is modestly reduced (6 h 26 m, Z = -0.94) while sleep start times are late (median ~01:03) and highly variable (sleep start SD = 208 minutes, Z = 2.74). High night-to-night variability in sleep timing is correlated positively with PSS (sleep timing SD r = 0.17) in this dataset and suggests inconsistent sleep–wake timing that can exacerbate perceived stress. Circadian metrics indicate low interdaily stability (value = 0.23, Z = -1.48) and elevated intradaily variability (value = 0.76, Z = 1.51). These features—reduced day-to-day rhythm stability and greater within-day fragmentation—are weak-to-moderate correlates of higher perceived stress in the sample (interdaily stability r = -0.11; intradaily variability r = 0.16). The combination of late, irregular sleep timing and diminished circadian regularity supports an interpretation of behavioral rhythm disruption that would be expected to accompany higher perceived stress.

Physiological arousal and hourly heart-rate patterning: Resting heart rate is slightly above the cohort mean (62.2 bpm, Z = 0.48) and has a small positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.14), consistent with modestly increased physiological arousal. Cosinor-derived rhythm amplitude is lower than average (amplitude = 5.8, Z = -1.61), which often corresponds with blunted daily variation in autonomic tone and has a negative correlation with PSS in the sample (r = -0.16), suggesting that reduced amplitude accompanies higher stress. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal decreases and daytime increases; several early-morning hours (e.g., 4–7 AM) show relatively large negative deviations and small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), potentially reflecting disturbed overnight physiology related to stress or inconsistent sleep. In sum, physiological indices point to modestly elevated baseline autonomic arousal alongside a blunted amplitude and fragmented rhythm—patterns that are concordant with the self-report indicators of increased perceived stress.

Behavioral context and protective factors: The participant reports high levels of socializing and listening to music (Z = 2.53 and Z = 2.06, respectively), behaviors that can function as social or recreational supports; however, these activities show only small correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.06–0.07) and thus provide limited counterweight to the stronger risk signals. Substance use is minimal and GPA is high, which are neutral-to-protective in relation to stress. Physical activity is relatively infrequent (exercise and sports Z-scores well below average), which may limit a common behavioral buffer against stress. Overall, while some social engagement and stable academic performance are present, they do not offset the stronger indicators of anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, and circadian irregularity.

Holistic assessment and PSS-group assignment: Balancing all modalities, the strongest and most consistently weighted evidence comes from elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (both with high positive correlations to PSS), disturbed subjective sleep, and objective markers of circadian irregularity and reduced rhythm amplitude. Physiological arousal (resting HR) is modestly increased and sleep timing variability is pronounced; both align with higher perceived stress. Protective features (frequent socializing, limited substance use, good academic performance) are present but have weaker ties to PSS in this dataset and therefore do not negate the larger risk signal. On balance, the multimodal profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level above the population median.

72806,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a low burden of internalizing symptoms and a generally adaptive psychological profile. The participant’s CES-D score (5; Z = -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 33; Z = -0.82) are well below the study mean, and self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39; Z = 0.11). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; Z = -0.8) sits at or just below the threshold for disturbance, which—together with low depressive and anxiety symptom scores—points toward relatively low reported emotional distress. Academic functioning appears strong (GPAs ~3.7–3.94) and substance use is minimal. Some negative signals are present but modest in magnitude: lower self-reported happiness (Z = -0.53) and lower health satisfaction (Z = -0.7), which suggest areas of reduced well-being that do not align with high symptom burden on depression or trait anxiety scales.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics support a pattern of organized daily physiology with low tonic cardiovascular activation. Resting heart rate is low (56.4 bpm; Z = -0.21) and mesor is slightly below average (72 bpm; Z = -0.27), consistent with relatively low baseline autonomic arousal. Circadian structure assessed by interdaily stability (0.47; Z = 0.5) and a moderate amplitude (12.5; Z = 0.56) indicates a fairly regular and robust daily rhythm. Intradaily variability is near the sample average (0.55; Z = 0.03), suggesting limited fragmentation of activity across the day. These features are most consistent with steady routines and lower physiological stress load across the recording period.

Time-of-day heart rate deviations reveal typical nocturnal suppression and daytime elevations, with one notable peak in the early evening. Night hours show substantial negative deviations from the mesor (down to ~-22 bpm overnight), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest. Daytime elevations are moderate, with particularly large positive deviation at 6–7pm (25.3 bpm; Z = 2.22), and a secondary elevation in mid-afternoon (3–4pm; Z = 1.11). The pronounced 6–7pm surge could reflect a consistent evening period of higher activity or arousal (e.g., exercise, commuting, social engagement). Self-reported exercise frequency (1–2×/week alone; Z = 0.32) is modest and does not fully explain a very large evening peak, so interpretation should remain cautious; nevertheless, the overall cardiovascular profile does not indicate chronic hyperarousal.

Sleep behavior and stability further align with lower perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is healthy (7 h 34 min; Z = 0.47) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ~85 minutes; Z = -0.36). Sleep onset is somewhat late (median start ~00:30) but relatively consistent (start-time SD Z = -0.32). Mean daily naps are infrequent (0.13; Z = 0.7). Taken together—adequate duration, reasonable regularity, and low intra-day fragmentation—these objective sleep metrics are more consistent with lower perceived stress than with the patterns typically associated with elevated stress (e.g., short, highly variable sleep and disrupted circadian stability).

Weighing the totality of evidence for perceived stress (PSS), there are multiple convergent signals indicating relatively low-to-average perceived stress in this participant. Low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, regular circadian structure, low resting heart rate, and adequate sleep duration all point toward placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress. Countervailing observations—slightly lower happiness and health satisfaction and an unusually large early-evening heart rate spike—are modest and do not outweigh the preponderance of low-stress indicators. Therefore, the participant is most consistent with the bottom 50% of the study population on PSS.

39146,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Self-report profile — psychological symptoms and well-being:
The participant reports low depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and a PSQI at the commonly used cutpoint for sleep disturbance (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) suggesting subjectively acceptable sleep quality overall. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42, Z = 0.07) is close to the study mean and modestly positively correlated with perceived stress in the sample (STAI–PSS r ≈ 0.31), indicating some anxiety-proneness but not an extreme elevation. Self-esteem is above average in this cohort (RSES Z = 0.68) and correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.16), a characteristic that would be expected to buffer perceived stress. Current happiness is slightly below average (self-report = 3.0, Z = -0.53), and lower momentary happiness in this dataset is modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ -0.19). Taken together, self-report measures show more evidence of resilience (low depressive symptoms, higher self-esteem, acceptable sleep quality) than of marked distress, though trait anxiety and lower current happiness are modest risk indicators for elevated perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
The participant reports minimal substance use and very low participation in group or regular exercise (exercise frequencies well below cohort means; Zs around -1.1 to -1.6). Recreational behaviors include a relatively high amount of video game time (1–2 hours; Z = 2.47) and above-average sedentary hobby time (Z = 1.41). These patterns suggest limited physical-activity–based stress-modulation and relatively sedentary leisure, which in some samples is associated with higher perceived stress but in this cohort have weak or heterogeneous correlations with PSS (several activity correlations near zero or slightly negative). Overall, lifestyle responses point to constrained behavioral stress-buffering via exercise but no evidence of substance use or other behaviors that would strongly amplify perceived stress.

Sleep timing and variability:
Wearable-derived and self-report sleep metrics converge on a relatively consistent but somewhat late sleep schedule. Median nightly sleep duration is slightly below average at about 6 h 48 min (Z = -0.47), with low day-to-day variability in duration (SD Z = -0.89) and essentially no reported naps (Z = -0.86). The median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:32), with moderate variability in start time. Shorter sleep duration and late bedtimes can contribute to increased perceived stress in some contexts, but here variability is low (regular schedule) and subjective sleep quality is acceptable (PSQI borderline good), so the net contribution to PSS is ambiguous and likely modest.

Wearable cardiovascular and circadian markers:
Heart rate–based circadian measures show a coherent daily rhythm with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 3:57 PM) and a clear evening peak in aggregate HR deviations (largest positive deviations ~5–7 PM). The participant’s resting heart rate (65.4 bpm, Z = 0.86) and mesor (78.4 bpm, Z = 0.61) are somewhat higher than cohort averages; modest positive correlations between resting HR and PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.13) suggest that these elevations could relate to greater perceived stress for some individuals. Nonparametric rhythm metrics show moderate interdaily stability (Z = 0.42) alongside slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.53), indicating a generally regular circadian pattern but some within-day fragmentation. Amplitude is near average (Z = 0.07). Overall, physiological signals present mild signs of higher autonomic arousal relative to peers but not a pattern of marked dysregulation.

Evidence supporting lower/average perceived stress (bottom 50):
- Low depressive symptom score (CES-D) and PSQI at or below the threshold indicate relative psychological and sleep health.
- Above-average self-esteem and moderate health satisfaction are protective and negatively associated with PSS in the study.
- Low substance use and absence of frequent naps or extreme sleep variability argue against behavioral markers of high stress.
- Many objective circadian measures are in the average range (amplitude, acrophase, interdaily stability), not indicating severe circadian disruption.

Evidence supporting higher perceived stress (top 50):
- Trait anxiety is modestly elevated relative to the cohort mean (STAI ≈ 42) and STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), an important predictor in this dataset.
- Resting heart rate and mesor are higher than average (Z ≈ 0.6–0.9) and show small positive correlations with PSS, suggesting some physiological arousal that could index stress.
- Sleep duration is slightly below average and bedtime is late (median start ≈ 01:32), factors that can be associated with higher perceived stress in some individuals.

Holistic interpretation and PSS-group assignment:
Balancing self-report and wearable-derived evidence, the profile contains a mix of modest risk indicators (trait anxiety, mildly elevated resting heart rate, late sleep timing, low exercise) and several protective or neutral indicators (low depressive symptoms, acceptable subjective sleep quality, above-average self-esteem, no substance use, regular sleep timing). The magnitude of the protective indicators (low CES-D, good PSQI Z, higher self-esteem) and the lack of strong physiological dysregulation weigh against classifying this participant as having elevated perceived stress relative to the cohort. The modest elevations in trait anxiety and resting heart rate are notable but not large enough in this multimodal context to outweigh the protective signals. Therefore the participant is more consistent with having PSS in the lower or middle portion of the cohort distribution.

Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, z = -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 35, z = -0.62) are both below the study mean, and the Rosenberg self-esteem index is substantially above the sample mean (z = 1.38). Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI = 3, z = -1.72). Academic performance and health satisfaction are also elevated (multiple GPAs ≈ 3.9; health satisfaction z = 1.22). Substance use is reported as absent, daily naps are rare, and social/leisure activities are moderate. The only small negative signals in the self-report domain are slightly lower-than-average momentary happiness (z ≈ -0.53) and very low reported frequency of exercise and sports participation, which may reflect a more sedentary routine despite other positive indicators.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics corroborate the participant’s subjective reports of good sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is long relative to the cohort (8 h 42 m, z = 1.88) with modest night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD and sleep start time SD both z ≈ -0.6). Median sleep start time is around 23:38 and mean daily naps are essentially absent (z = -0.86). These objective sleep data—long, consistent nocturnal sleep with low nap frequency—are typically associated with better subjective well-being and lower stress in college samples, and the correlations provided with PSS for sleep metrics are small and generally in the expected direction (longer sleep weakly associated with lower perceived stress).

Cardiovascular circadian indices show a well-organized, high-amplitude rhythm. Non-parametric and cosinor-derived features indicate relatively strong day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.59, z = 1.49; autocorrelation at 24 h z = 1.65) and lower within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability z = -1.24). The fitted cosinor amplitude is elevated (z = 1.59) with an acrophase in the mid-afternoon (≈ 3:42 PM). Hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal dips (roughly -13 to -23 bpm versus mesor overnight) and clear daytime elevations with peak deviations in the early afternoon (1–3 PM, largest positive z-scores). Resting heart rate is modestly above the sample mean (62.8 bpm, z = 0.55). Overall, these heart-rate patterns reflect a strong, consolidated circadian profile and robust nocturnal recovery—features that, given the available correlations (amplitude and stability modestly negatively correlated with PSS), tend to align with lower perceived stress rather than elevated stress.

Integrative evaluation of evidence favors placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Multiple independent indicators that are moderately predictive of perceived stress point toward lower stress: low depressive and trait anxiety scores, high self-esteem, good objective and subjective sleep, strong circadian regularity and amplitude, low substance use, and high academic and health-satisfaction ratings. Minor countervailing signals (slightly elevated resting heart rate, low frequency of exercise, and marginally lower momentary happiness) are small in magnitude and are not supported by stronger, converging data that would indicate high perceived stress. Considering effect directions and magnitudes across self-report and wearable modalities, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress (PSS) would be in the bottom half of the study population.

Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82) are both below the study mean, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem score (40, highest possible) and current happiness rating (5, Z = 1.64) indicate high subjective well-being. The participant reports minimal substance use, frequent social exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23), strong academic performance (GPAs ~3.8–4.0), and above-average health satisfaction (Z = 0.8). These elements collectively point toward effective psychosocial functioning and resources that typically associate with lower perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian regularity: Subjectively and via screening, there is evidence of disrupted sleep quality (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), despite median objectively recorded sleep duration that is adequate (median 7 h 24 min, Z = 0.28). Wearable-derived sleep timing shows a late median sleep start (~23:34) and elevated night-to-night variability in sleep onset (start time SD Z = 1.12) and in total sleep (SD Z = 0.61). These features indicate sleep timing irregularity and fragmentation across the semester. Irregular sleep timing is a factor that can contribute to perceived stress or exacerbate daytime difficulties even when overall sleep time is not reduced.

Circadian and heart rate physiology: Heart-rate–based circadian features are mixed. The participant has a relatively low mesor (58.35, Z = -2.13) and a low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, Z = -1.49), which are consistent with high cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic physiological arousal. At the same time, non-parametric rhythm metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.30, Z = -0.9) and elevated intradaily variability (0.75, Z = 1.44), indicating less regular day-to-day structure and more fragmentation in activity/physiology. Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced morning peaks (notably 7–9am with very large positive deviations, e.g., 7–8am Z = 3.24) and an evening heart-rate elevation ~7–8pm (Z = 1.87), with strong nocturnal troughs. In sum, the physiological baseline (low resting HR) suggests low chronic autonomic arousal, but the circadian instability and intraday fragmentation imply inconsistent routines.

Signals that could elevate perceived stress vs. signals that suggest lower perceived stress: Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress includes disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), marked variability in sleep timing, and elevated intradaily variability/low interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms — each associated in the literature with greater day-to-day strain or reduced resilience. However, these risk signals are counterbalanced by multiple robust indicators of lower perceived stress: low scores on depressive and anxiety measures, high self-reported happiness and self-esteem, minimal substance use, frequent social exercise, and strong academic performance. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate and low mesor argue against chronically elevated cardiovascular arousal. Correlations between many wearable features and PSS in this dataset are small in magnitude, and where present (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16, sleep-start variability r ≈ 0.17) they are modest.

Holistic conclusion regarding PSS placement: When integrating self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, the balance of evidence supports placement of this participant’s perceived stress in the lower half of the study distribution. The participant shows strong psychosocial resources and low affective symptomatology that typically correspond to lower PSS scores, while the notable sleep timing irregularity and rhythm fragmentation are present but do not outweigh the multiple converging indicators of low perceived distress. Therefore, it is most likely that this participant’s PSS score would fall in the bottom 50% of the study population.

59673,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate a generally low burden of internalizing symptoms and the presence of protective self-appraisals. The participant’s CES‑D (score 7, Z = -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43) are both below the study mean, and the self‑esteem score is markedly high (Z = 1.66). Self‑rated happiness is slightly above average and academic performance is strong (GPAs near 3.8–3.9). These trait-level indicators typically align with lower perceived stress: the CES‑D and STAI both show modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), so the participant’s lower scores on those instruments point toward a lower PSS relative to peers.

Sleep reports and wearable sleep metrics present a mixed picture. Subjective sleep quality is impaired (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), yet Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is reasonable (7 h 37 min, Z = 0.54). Night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD = 144 min, Z = 0.98) and median sleep onset is late (01:21) with moderate variability. Several of these sleep variability features show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.14; sleep start time SD r ≈ 0.17), suggesting that irregular or fragmented sleep is one pathway by which perceived stress could be higher for some people. In this participant the objective duration is adequate but consistency and subjective quality are areas of strain.

Wearable circadian and cardiac measures indicate mostly typical central tendency but some irregularity in daily structure. Cosinor parameters (MESOR, amplitude) are close to sample averages and resting heart rate is slightly below average (57.2 bpm, Z ≈ -0.11). Non‑parametric rhythm measures show modest intradaily variability (IV = 0.57, Z ≈ 0.17) and relatively low 24‑hour autocorrelation (AC24 = 0.24, Z ≈ -0.70), which points to weaker day‑to‑day regularity in heart rate rhythms. Hourly mean deviations from the mesor reveal expected low values during deep sleep hours and clear daytime/evening elevations, but also an unusually elevated deviation around midnight (12–1am, Z = 1.72) and strong evening peaks (e.g., 6–7pm, Z ≈ 1.44). These rhythm irregularities and higher intradaily variability have small positive associations with PSS in the sample (IV r ≈ 0.16; some hourly deviations modestly related), implying that physiological irregularity could co-occur with greater perceived stress, though effect sizes are small.

Integrative interpretation and PSS group assignment. The strongest and most direct evidence about stable psychological state comes from self‑report trait measures (depression, trait anxiety, self‑esteem), which consistently indicate a relatively low internalizing symptom burden and protective self‑perceptions. Objective wearable data point to some circadian irregularity and subjective sleep disturbance, both of which are modestly correlated with higher PSS in the cohort; however, these associations are small and the participant’s central physiological measures (MESOR, amplitude, resting HR) are close to average. Balancing the pattern—robust indicators of low trait distress against modest signals of sleep/circadian irregularity—I judge that the overall evidence more strongly favors placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution (bottom 50%). The sleep and rhythm irregularities are noteworthy and may represent targets for intervention, but they do not outweigh the low depression and anxiety trait scores.

74899,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = +1.06) and a modestly elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D = 17, Z = +0.38). Self‑esteem is relatively low (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87). These self-report indicators that most strongly correlate with perceived stress in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; RSES r ≈ -0.15) point toward greater emotional burden than the population mean. At the same time, the participant reports comparatively high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = +1.30) and a high level of generalized trust (Z = +1.79), which are psychosocial resources that tend to buffer stress. Taken together, the self-report profile shows a mix of risk signals (elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower self‑esteem) and protective signals (high health satisfaction, trust), with the risk signals being more directly related to higher perceived stress based on their observed correlations with PSS.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-derived sleep and circadian indicators suggest notable sleep restriction and a delayed/irregular sleep schedule. Median nightly sleep duration is 5 h 58 min (Z = -1.52), and median sleep start time is late (about 02:25 AM) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (SD ≈ 65 minutes). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05). Circadian summary measures show only modest interdaily stability (0.43, Z ≈ +0.17) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (0.61, Z ≈ +0.46), and a relatively low 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.30, Z ≈ -0.19), indicating somewhat irregular daily structure. Heart rate features show a raised mesor (80.9 bpm, Z = +0.95) and an evening acrophase (~5:49 PM) with pronounced positive heart‑rate deviations in the late afternoon and evening (e.g., 5–6 PM deviation = +22.1, Z = +1.69). Short sleep duration, late sleep timing, and signs of circadian fragmentation are all mechanisms associated with higher self‑reported stress and poorer affect regulation; the participant’s poor subjective sleep and objectively short sleep are therefore consistent with increased perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: Activity patterns include regular solo exercise (exercising alone ≥3×/week, Z = +1.07) and modest participation in sports and socializing. Substance use is limited to moderate beer consumption (1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1.01) and rare wine/liquor use; no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use is reported. Daytime recreation is low for some restorative activities (reads/do‑not‑do; listening to music = ≤15 min). Academic performance (recent GPAs ~3.2–3.5) is within a healthy range. These lifestyle features present a mixed picture: regular exercise and absence of drug use are protective against elevated perceived stress, but moderate evening alcohol use and limited engagement in low‑arousal leisure activities may limit recovery from daily demands. The evening peak in heart rate combined with late sleep timing suggests elevated physiological arousal or activity in the evening hours, which can interfere with sleep onset and amplify perceived stress.

Evidence weighing low/median PSS: Protective indicators that might predict placement in the bottom half of PSS include consistent exercise frequency (Z ≈ +1.07), reasonably high health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.30), high interpersonal trust (Z ≈ +1.79), no recreational drug use, and adequate academic performance. Several of these factors are modestly negatively associated with PSS or are known resilience factors and therefore point toward lower perceived stress.

Evidence weighing high PSS: Indicators favoring placement in the top half of the PSS distribution include elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = +1.06), poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +1.05), objectively short median sleep duration (Z = -1.52), low self‑esteem (Z = -0.87), modest circadian irregularity (intradaily variability Z = +0.46), raised mesor (Z ≈ +0.95), and pronounced evening heart‑rate elevations (e.g., 5–6 PM Z = +1.69). Several of these measures show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (notably STAI and CES‑D), and the combination of heightened anxiety, poor sleep, short sleep duration, and evening physiological arousal provides convergent evidence for greater perceived stress.

Holistic assessment and PSS grouping: Balancing risk and protective features, the data show stronger convergence on markers that are associated with higher perceived stress (elevated trait anxiety, poor sleep quality and short duration, low self‑esteem, and evening physiological arousal), even though some protective lifestyle resources are present. Given the relative magnitudes (STAI and PSQI Z ≈ +1.0, sleep duration substantially below the sample mean Z ≈ -1.52, and evening HR deviations with large positive Z), the preponderance of evidence favors a PSS placement in the upper half of the study distribution. Therefore the participant is more likely to have a PSS score in the top 50% of the sample.

35011,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report psychological measures present a mixed pattern but tilt toward greater perceived stress. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms on the CES-D (score = 20; Z = 0.7), a measure that correl positively with PSS in this sample (r = 0.29), indicating depressive symptom burden that is associated with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety by STAI is below the sample mean (score = 36; Z = -0.52) and correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.31), suggesting that low trait anxiety would favor lower perceived stress; however, the observed CES-D elevation reduces confidence in a low-stress profile. Self-reported sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7) and self-rated happiness is modestly above average (current = 4; Z = 0.55), with happiness negatively related to PSS (r = -0.19). Self-esteem (reported score and Z = 0.96) is relatively high and is associated with lower PSS (r = -0.15), offering some countervailing evidence for lower perceived stress. Overall, the self-report profile combines elevated depressive symptoms and disturbed sleep with protective signals from lower trait anxiety and higher self-esteem.

Objective sleep and circadian/wearable physiological metrics indicate dysregulated rest–activity and autonomic patterns that are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. Nighttime sleep is short (median duration ≈ 6 h 5 min; Z = -1.37) with a late median sleep onset (~02:34), and subjective sleep quality is disturbed; shortened and delayed sleep timing are both plausibly linked to higher stress. Circadian summary metrics are notably perturbed: interdaily stability is low (value = 0.17; Z = -1.98), amplitude of the fitted 24-hour heart rate rhythm is markedly reduced (amplitude = 4.29; Z = -2.10), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (value = 0.13; Z = -1.62). These indicate a flattened, less regular heart-rate circadian profile across the recording period. Intradaily variability is relatively elevated (value = 0.74; Z = 1.37), consistent with greater fragmentation of physiological state across the day. Collectively, these circadian and variability features — especially the low interdaily stability and low amplitude — are stronger, objective indicators that align with increased perceived stress in this sample (amplitude and stability have correlations with PSS in the expected directions).

Cardiovascular resting indices further support an elevated arousal signature. Resting heart rate is high relative to the study population (77.6 bpm; Z = 2.31), and higher resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.15). The hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime peaks, but the combination of an elevated mesor (MESOR = 86.67; Z = 1.74) and elevated resting heart rate suggests a generally higher baseline cardiovascular activation across the day, which is consistent with greater perceived stress or physiological arousal.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle variables provide additional context that modestly favors higher perceived stress. Alcohol use occurs at a weekly frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), exercise frequency is low (typically 1–2 times/month; Zs negative), and socializing time is below average (Z = -0.62). Low physical activity and reduced social engagement are behaviors frequently associated with both poorer sleep and greater perceived stress. Health satisfaction is low (score = 1.89; Z = -1.78), which is consistent with the physiological and sleep disturbances and is another signal linked to higher stress. Conversely, the participant reports little recreational drug use and has some protective indicators (higher self-esteem, modest happiness), but these appear insufficient to offset the objective circadian and autonomic evidence.

Integrated interpretation and PSS group classification: weighing the relative strengths of the signals, the most salient indicators here are objective and robust — severely reduced circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (Zs ≈ -2.1 and -1.98), markedly elevated resting heart rate (Z = 2.31), and objectively short and late sleep — all of which are consistently associated with higher perceived stress in this sample. Self-report depressive symptoms and disturbed subjective sleep further corroborate this direction, while lower trait anxiety and higher self-esteem offer partial, weaker counterevidence. On balance, the multimodal profile (objective circadian disruption + elevated resting HR + short/late sleep + elevated depressive symptoms) more closely matches patterns observed in the study population’s higher PSS scores. Therefore the participant is more consistent with being in the top half of the PSS distribution.

89710,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report psychological profile and symptom burden:
The participant reports markedly elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms relative to the study population. The CES-D score is 39 (z = 2.67), indicating a high level of self-reported recent depressive symptoms; the STAI–Trait score is 55 (z = 1.35), indicating relatively elevated trait anxiety. Self-esteem is comparatively low (RSES = 25, z = -1.85). Subjective sleep quality is worse than average (PSQI = 10, z = 1.52), consistent with clinically meaningful sleep disturbance. Together, these self-report indices form a coherent pattern: high affective symptom burden (depression and anxiety) co-occurs with low self-regard and poor subjective sleep, a profile that, based on the known positive associations between these measures and perceived stress (reported score correlations with PSS are positive for CES-D and STAI), would be expected to align with higher perceived stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate reduced day-to-day regularity and a blunted amplitude of the 24-hour rhythm. Interdaily stability is low (0.22, z = -1.56) and amplitude is reduced (7.57, z = -1.04), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is also below average (z = -0.95). These features reflect relatively irregular daily structure and a less pronounced circadian rhythm of cardiovascular activity. Resting heart rate is within the sample average range (58.2 bpm, z ≈ 0.01). The hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs (large negative deviations overnight) and a pronounced evening peak, especially at 5–6 pm (value +20.32, z = 1.43). The presence of a robust evening elevation in heart rate concurrent with blunted overall amplitude and low interdaily stability suggests elevated physiological activation during certain parts of the day combined with irregular daily timing, a combination that has modest positive correlations with perceived stress in this dataset.

Sleep timing and variability:
Objective sleep duration is slightly below sample mean (median 6 h 44 min, z = -0.56) while subjective sleep difficulty is elevated (PSQI). Sleep timing is late on average (median start ≈ 01:25 AM) and relatively inconsistent across nights (sleep start SD ≈ 133 minutes, z = 1.09). High variability in sleep timing and late sleep onset are both features that, in this dataset, correlate positively with higher PSS. Nap frequency is low (mean daily naps 0.1). The combination of short-to-moderate nightly sleep, poor subjective sleep quality, late chronic timing, and high night-to-night variability aligns with behavioral patterns that commonly accompany higher perceived stress.

Lifestyle, activity, and contextual indicators:
Daily recreational and activity reports show high discretionary screen exposure and sedentary leisure: internet use and listening to music are both reported as “more than 4 hours” with high z-scores (internet z = 2.19; music z = 2.06). Video game time is elevated (z = 1.71). Exercise frequency is low-to-moderate (exercising alone 1–2 times/month; with others 1–2 times/week). Alcohol use is minimal for beer and occasional for wine (1–2 times/week). Socializing time is modest (1–2 hours). These behavioral patterns (high screen time, limited regular solo exercise) co-occur with the circadian irregularity and sleep disturbance and have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample, supporting an interpretation of greater psychosocial load and fewer consistent behavioral buffers against stress.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Multiple independent indicators converge on an interpretation of elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Strongest contributors are markedly elevated depressive and trait-anxiety scores, low self-esteem, and disturbed subjective sleep—each of which shows positive or expected relations with perceived stress. Wearable data reinforce this perspective: low interdaily stability and reduced circadian amplitude indicate irregular daily structure, large night-to-night variability in sleep timing is present, and there is an elevated evening heart-rate peak—features that are either directly correlated with higher PSS in the dataset or are plausible physiological correlates of higher stress. Some neutral or mildly protective signs exist (resting heart rate near sample mean; some social exercise), but on balance the psychological symptom burden, poor subjective sleep, late and variable sleep timing, and behavioral patterns (high screen exposure, limited regular exercise) point toward a perceived stress level above the median for this population.

Conclusion (PSS group):
Given the confluence of high depressive and anxiety symptoms, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep, irregular circadian metrics and sleep timing variability, and lifestyle patterns that modestly associate with stress, the overall evidence indicates the participant’s PSS score is most consistent with the upper half of the study population distribution.

97596,32.0,1.0,"Self-report measures indicate a profile consistent with elevated affective distress. The participant’s CES-D score (33, Z = 2.05) is substantially above the study mean and classified as “Depressed,” and the STAI–Trait score (47, Z = 0.56) is moderately elevated; both scales have positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.27; STAI r ≈ 0.31), supporting an association between these symptom reports and higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES = 36, Z = −0.31) and momentary happiness is low (self-reported happy = 2.0, Z = −1.61), which, when considered with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, point toward greater subjective burden and less positive affect—factors that typically track with higher perceived stress.

Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor despite objectively long sleep duration. The PSQI score is highly elevated (15, Z = 3.83), indicating frequent sleep-related complaints or impairment. Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a relatively long median sleep duration (8 h 10 min, Z = 1.22) and few naps, but a late and somewhat variable sleep onset (median start ~00:31, sleep start SD ≈ 90 min). The combination of long but subjectively disturbed sleep suggests either nonrestorative sleep or difficulties with sleep continuity that are captured by self-report but not fully by total sleep time; poor sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.

Circadian and cardiac metrics from the wearable point to modestly elevated physiological activation and fragmented daily structure. Resting heart rate (63.6 bpm, Z = 0.65) and mesor (77.8, Z = 0.53) are above the sample mean, and intradaily variability is elevated (IV = 0.66, Z = 0.81), indicating more within-day fragmentation of heart rate patterns. Interdaily stability is near average-to-slightly-low (IS = 0.39, Z = −0.16). The acrophase around mid- to late-afternoon (~4:14 PM) and pronounced positive deviations in the late afternoon/early evening hours (notably 5–7 PM with Z ≈ 0.8–0.84) suggest typical daytime activation with relatively larger evening cardiovascular responses. Several of these wearable features (IV, resting HR) have small positive correlations with PSS in the study, consistent with a physiological profile often seen with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators provide mixed information but overall do not outweigh the signal from symptom and physiological data. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more; Z = 1.07) and moderate socializing (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95), low substance use, and relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 0.72). These behaviors can be protective against stress. However, they coexist with pronounced depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep, low happiness, and physiological markers of arousal and rhythm fragmentation; the magnitude of the symptom and sleep disturbances (notably the very high PSQI z-score and CES-D z-score) outweigh the modest protective behaviors in terms of their known association with perceived stress.

Holistic assessment: weighing the convergent evidence—substantially elevated depressive symptoms, moderately elevated trait anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, low positive affect, and wearable indicators of elevated resting heart rate and increased intraday variability—the balance of evidence favors a higher perceived stress level relative to the study population. Protective lifestyle features (exercise, low substance use, some social time) are present but appear insufficient to offset the strong indicators of affective distress and sleep disturbance. On this integrated basis, the participant’s PSS placement is most consistent with the upper half of the sample distribution.

Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 35, z ≈ -0.45 for negative direction meaning higher self-esteem relative to population) and correlates weakly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), which again aligns with a lower-perceived-stress profile. Academic functioning (GPA consistently near 4.0) and generally moderate health satisfaction further point toward functioning that would not be expected to coincide with markedly elevated perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators are mixed but do not strongly indicate high perceived stress. The participant reports alcohol consumption at 1–2 times per week (z ≈ 1.0) and elevated internet use (2–3 hours, z ≈ 0.85); these behaviors can be neutral or variably related to stress in this population and show minimal correlations with PSS in the provided data. Physical-activity reporting is heterogeneous (sports 1–2 times/week, but limited solo exercise), and socializing time is near the sample mean. Self-reported sleep quality (PSQI = 6) crosses a common clinical threshold for disturbance, which could signal sleep-related contribution to stress; however, the PSQI z-score provided is only modestly below the population mean (z ≈ -0.33) and correlations with PSS in the dataset are modest, so the PSQI alone provides only weak evidence toward higher perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics generally support relatively low-to-moderate perceived stress. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.3 bpm, z ≈ -0.70), a pattern typically associated with higher cardiovascular fitness and not with heightened stress; resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), so the participant’s lower resting rate is consistent with lower PSS. Nighttime aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (e.g., -22 bpm around 3–5 AM) and a robust daytime rise with a pronounced morning elevation (8–9 AM value z ≈ 2.26), indicating appreciable day–night amplitude (amplitude z ≈ 0.24) and a clear acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:00 PM). Non-parametric circadian indices show modest interdaily stability (value 0.43, z ≈ 0.17) and somewhat reduced intradaily variability (value 0.51, z ≈ -0.25); given small negative correlations between interdaily stability and PSS (r ≈ -0.12) and small positive correlations between intradaily variability and PSS (r ≈ 0.16), these circadian features slightly favor a lower perceived-stress interpretation. One circadian indicator—autocorrelation at 24 hours—is relatively low (0.20, z ≈ -1.03) and correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.17), which could be interpreted as a weak signal that circadian regularity is less robust than in many peers; however, this effect is modest and counterbalanced by the preserved amplitude, long median sleep duration, and low resting heart rate.

Holistic synthesis and PSS-group assessment: multiple convergent signals point toward the participant being in the lower half of the sample distribution for perceived stress. Lower-than-average depressive and trait-anxiety scores, higher self-esteem, low resting heart rate, long median sleep duration (median ~8 h 8 min, z ≈ 1.18), and high academic performance weigh toward a bottom-half PSS classification. Countervailing or ambiguous signals (PSQI = 6 suggesting some sleep disturbance, modestly elevated alcohol use, reduced 24-hour autocorrelation) are present but are small in magnitude or have weak correlations with PSS in this dataset. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports classifying this participant’s PSS as in the bottom 50% of the study population distribution.

17308,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Self-report profile and affective symptoms: The participant reports relatively low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) and above-average momentary happiness (self-rated happiness Z = 0.55). Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) is slightly above the study mean but not markedly elevated; the STAI score correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), indicating that modestly higher trait anxiety would be expected to accompany higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17), health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.8), and academic performance is strong (GPA ~3.7). Taken together, self-report indicators emphasize relatively good mood, self-regard, and functioning, with only a small signal of elevated trait anxiety that could modestly elevate perceived stress.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators: The participant engages in regular physical activity (exercised alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07) and reports limited sedentary/recreational screen time (internet and TV use both low; Zs around -1.8 and -0.62). Alcohol consumption is present at a moderate weekly frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Zs ~0.94–1.01), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Socializing time is relatively low (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41). Overall, an active exercise pattern and low sedentary recreation are protective for perceived stress, whereas limited social time and modest alcohol use are potential, but not large, contributors to stress vulnerability.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure: Cardiovascular metrics indicate low overall cardiac tone and good fitness: mesor (mean heart rate) is low (60.85 bpm, Z = -1.79) and resting heart rate is very low (47.2 bpm, Z = -1.3). The participant shows a robust nocturnal decline in heart rate (nighttime hourly deviations to −18 to −23 bpm relative to mesor) and pronounced daytime peaks, particularly a large positive deviation at 10–11am (18.7 bpm, Z = 1.98). Circadian regularity is modest: interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.37, Z = -0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (Z = -0.53), but intradaily variability is near the sample mean. Amplitude and acrophase are within typical ranges (acrophase ~4:37 PM). Physiological indicators therefore reflect a well-conditioned cardiovascular profile and clear day–night separation, without marked circadian fragmentation—patterns generally associated with lower physiological stress load.

Sleep timing and variability: Objective sleep duration is slightly above the cohort median (median 7 h 27 m, Z = 0.33) and night-to-night variability in duration is low (SD 64 min, Z = -0.84). The median sleep start time is late (~1:18 AM) but highly regular (start-time SD 36 minutes, Z = -1.02). The PSQI score (5, Z = -0.8) falls at the threshold typically interpreted as acceptable sleep quality for this cohort. These features indicate consistent, adequate sleep duration and low variability—factors that typically mitigate perceived stress—even though the timing is late.

Synthesis regarding perceived stress (PSS placement): Evidence favoring lower or average perceived stress includes low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, strong exercise habits, low resting heart rate and mesor (indicative of low physiological arousal), consistent and adequate sleep, and above-average health satisfaction and academic functioning. Evidence that could point toward higher perceived stress is limited: trait anxiety is modestly above average (STAI Z = 0.17) and socializing time is relatively low. Correlations in the dataset show that STAI and CES-D are positively associated with PSS, but those scores here are only mildly shifted. Considering the magnitude and direction of available measures, the preponderance of protective indicators (fitness, sleep regularity, mood, self-esteem, health satisfaction) outweighs the small signals that would predict elevated stress. On balance, the participant is more consistent with the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

Trait anxiety (STAI trait = 35, Z = -0.62) and depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07) are both below or near the study mean, and self-esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 1.10). The participant reports relatively high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = 1.63) and maintains strong academic performance (GPA in the mid-to-high 3.0s). These self-report indices that typically correlate positively with PSS (e.g., STAI and CES-D correlations with PSS are ~0.3) are nevertheless low here, which points toward lower perceived stress than the study average.

Lifestyle and behavioral data align with factors associated with lower perceived stress. The participant engages in regular exercise and sports (exercise and sports Z-scores ~1.1–1.6), reports modest alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week), minimal recreational drug use, and frequent social and recreational activities (listening to music and 1–2 hours socializing). Sedentary and solitary leisure are minimal. These active lifestyle patterns, combined with low trait anxiety and elevated self-esteem, are consistent with a psychological and behavioral context that would tend to reduce perceived stress.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian measures show a mixture of salutary and irregular features. Resting heart rate is markedly low (41.1 bpm, Z = -2.03), consistent with high aerobic fitness and generally lower autonomic arousal; because resting heart rate correlates modestly and positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), this low value is evidence pointing toward lower perceived stress. The cosinor mesor is also lower than average (MESOR Z = -1.90). However, circadian organization shows diminished interdaily stability (Z = -0.74) and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), indicating day-to-day schedule irregularity and more fragmented within-day rhythms. Intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), so these rhythm irregularities provide mild evidence toward higher perceived stress. Aggregate hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions and relatively higher evening heart rate deviations; several evening-time positive deviations (e.g., 6–11 pm) have small negative correlations with PSS, so the participant’s pattern of greater evening cardiovascular activation aligns weakly with lower perceived stress in this sample.

Sleep metrics present a mixed signal relevant to perceived stress. Objective median nightly sleep duration is near seven hours but slightly below the cohort mean (6 h 57 m, Z = -0.28), and subjective sleep quality is impaired (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed; Z = 0.59). Sleep timing is relatively late on average (median start ~00:56) with moderate night-to-night variability (start time SD Z = 0.61). Poor subjective sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress, so the PSQI score provides some evidence toward elevated stress. Nonetheless, objective sleep duration and low reported napping frequency do not strongly suggest severe sleep restriction, and the participant’s strong fitness and low resting HR may buffer stress-related physiological consequences.

Holistic synthesis weighing all modalities: the strongest and most consistent indicators point toward lower-than-average perceived stress. Low trait anxiety and low-to-average depressive symptoms, elevated self-esteem, frequent physical activity, excellent cardiovascular fitness (very low resting HR), and high health satisfaction are all robust signals that have been associated with lower PSS scores in this population. Countervailing signals—subjective poor sleep and circadian irregularity—are present but are of smaller magnitude and weaker correlation to PSS in this dataset. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

77872,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Summary of self-report psychological and behavioral indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile shows relatively low affective symptom burden and traits commonly associated with lower perceived stress. CES-D depressive symptoms are low (score = 11; Z = -0.24) and trait anxiety is modest (STAI = 33; Z = -0.82), both of which correlate positively but only modestly with PSS in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is above the sample mean (RSES Z = 0.82) and overall health satisfaction is elevated (5.56/7; Z = 0.97), factors that typically associate with lower perceived stress (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15; health satisfaction r ≈ -0.08). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; Z = -0.8) is in the “good” range relative to peers, which also is consistent with lower stress burden. Some indicators suggest modest risk factors for momentary strain—current happiness rating is somewhat below average (Z = -0.53) and beer consumption is higher than the sample mean (1–2 times/week; alcohol use Z = 1.01)—but correlations of those behaviors with PSS in the cohort are small. Overall, the self-report pattern points toward below-average or near-average perceived stress rather than elevated stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological patterns:
Fitbit-derived heart-rate circadian metrics indicate a coherent, moderately strong daily rhythm and relatively low physiological fragmentation. Cosinor-derived amplitude and mesor are above the sample mean (amplitude Z = 0.75; mesor Z = 0.65), and intradaily variability is substantially lower than the cohort average (IV Z = -1.31), suggesting less within-day fragmentation of activity/arousal. Interdaily stability is near average (Z = -0.08) and 24-hour autocorrelation is slightly positive (Z = 0.14), consistent with a generally regular daily pattern. Resting heart rate is low-to-average (57.8 bpm; Z = -0.04), which often indexes better cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic sympathetic arousal. Taken together, these objective markers (amplitude and low IV) are more consistent with lower perceived stress levels; amplitude correlates modestly negative with PSS (r ≈ -0.17) and IV correlates modestly positive (r ≈ 0.16), so the direction of the participant’s metrics aligns with lower PSS.

Diurnal heart-rate profile and sleep timing:
Hourly deviations from the mesor reflect a typical nocturnal trough and daytime/evening elevations, with the peak cardiac activity occurring in the late afternoon to early evening (acrophase ≈ 5:58 PM). Notable positive deviations occur in the evening (e.g., 5–6 PM and 11–12 AM), and large negative deviations overnight are consistent with normal sleep-related heart-rate decline. Median nightly sleep duration is slightly below the sample mean (6 h 50 min; Z = -0.44) and median sleep start time is late (≈ 1:58 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability. While shorter-than-average sleep duration and delayed sleep timing can be associated with higher stress for some individuals, the participant’s subjective sleep quality is still rated favorably and objective circadian robustness (high amplitude, low fragmentation) suggests overall physiological regularity. The correlations between sleep metrics and PSS in the cohort are small, so these sleep features are not strong indicators either way in isolation.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Multiple independent lines of evidence converge toward the participant having lower-than-average perceived stress. Low trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores, higher-than-average self-esteem and health satisfaction, a coherent and relatively strong heart-rate circadian rhythm (higher amplitude, low intradaily variability), and a low resting heart rate each point away from elevated perceived stress. Countervailing signals are limited: a late median sleep onset, slightly reduced sleep duration, modest weekly beer use, and a below-average momentary happiness rating could reflect situational sources of strain but are not strongly associated with PSS in the sample (small correlations). Considering the magnitude, direction, and consistency of both self-report and wearable-derived measures, the balance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the PSS distribution (i.e., lower or average perceived stress).

72348,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report psychological profile and mental-health–related symptoms:
The participant reports low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms relative to the study cohort (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76; STAI–Trait = 39, Z = -0.23). These scores are below sample average and, given the modest positive correlations of CES-D and STAI with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.28 and r ≈ 0.31 respectively), the participant’s low scores on these measures point toward lower perceived stress than average. Rosenberg self‑esteem is moderately above average (score = 34, Z = -0.59 indicates slightly higher self‑esteem relative to sample mean), which is also indirectly supportive of lower perceived stress (self‑esteem correlates negatively, though weakly, with PSS). Current self-reported happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (3.0, Z = -0.53) and has a small negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.19), indicating a potential, but limited, countervailing influence toward higher perceived stress. Overall, the self-report psychological measures more strongly support a lower-than-average perceived stress level than an elevated one.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological signals:
Cardiovascular circadian metrics indicate a highly regular and robust 24‑hour structure in heart-rate activity. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are both high (interdaily stability = 0.65, Z = 1.99; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.62, Z = 2.49), while intradaily variability is relatively low (0.43, Z = -0.81). This pattern—high day‑to‑day regularity and low fragmentation—is typically associated with behavioral regularity and can be protective against elevated perceived stress. The participant’s MESOR and resting heart rate are elevated relative to the cohort (MESOR = 86.3, Z = 1.69; resting HR = 71.2, Z = 1.55), which could reflect higher baseline physiological arousal; correlations of these heart‑rate metrics with PSS are small (r ≈ 0.06–0.14), indicating only limited direct evidence linking this participant’s elevated heart‑rate setpoint to higher perceived stress. Hourly aggregate deviations show a clear nocturnal dip and daytime peaks (acrophase ~3:25 PM), consistent with a normal diurnal profile; the hourly correlations with PSS are small and mixed, providing little strong directional evidence.

Objective and subjective sleep patterns:
Objectively, the participant demonstrates relatively long and regular nocturnal sleep (median sleep duration ≈ 8 h 22 min, Z = 1.48) with low night‑to‑night variability in duration (SD ≈ 39 min, Z = -1.4) and consistent sleep onset timing (~23:45, low variability). These objective sleep characteristics are generally associated with lower perceived stress. In contrast, the participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 8, classification: disturbed sleep; Z = 0.59). This discrepancy—good objective sleep regularity and duration but poorer subjective sleep quality—raises a nuance: subjective sleep complaints can reflect daytime distress or sleep fragmentation not captured by aggregate metrics, and subjective sleep difficulties are often linked with higher perceived stress. However, given the relatively small effect sizes in correlations reported and the strong objective regularity, the overall sleep evidence modestly favors lower perceived stress with a note of subjective sleep concern.

Lifestyle, activity, and contextual factors:
The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use), low frequency of organized sports or exercise (exercising alone 1–2 times/month; Zs negative), and elevated sedentary recreational activities and internet use (internet use 3–4 hours, Z = 1.52; sedentary hobby 1–2 hours, Z = 1.41). Academic performance is strong (GPAs in the 3.6–3.93 range). Lower physical activity and greater sedentary/leisure screen time can be associated with higher perceived stress in some samples, but in this participant those behaviors coexist with low depressive/anxiety scores, stable circadian structure, and good objective sleep, reducing the weight of that signal. Overall, the lifestyle pattern is mixed: protective features (no substance use, strong academic functioning, regular sleep timing) are present alongside lower exercise and higher sedentary/screen behaviors.

Holistic integration and PSS-group inference:
Balancing modalities, the strongest signals favoring lower perceived stress are: low self‑reported depressive and trait‑anxiety symptoms, moderately higher self‑esteem, strong objective sleep duration and regularity, and highly regular circadian organization (high interdaily stability and autocorrelation). Signals that could point toward elevated stress—subjective sleep disturbance on the PSQI, slightly elevated resting heart rate and MESOR, reduced reported happiness, and limited exercise—are present but comparatively weaker in magnitude and/or correlation with PSS in this dataset. Given the relative magnitudes (notably negative Z-scores for mood measures, high positive Zs for circadian regularity, and only modest positive Zs for physiological arousal), the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s perceived stress is more likely in the lower half of the study distribution. Therefore the participant is more consistent with the bottom 50% of PSS scores in this cohort.

89607,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Psychological symptom profile: Self-report measures indicate elevated internalizing symptomatology that is relevant to perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score (24) is above the sample mean (Z = 1.11) and is associated with a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), indicating that greater depressive symptom burden in this participant is likely to align with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) is similarly elevated and shows an even stronger positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). These two proximal indicators of mood and anxiety provide the clearest self-report signal pointing toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study population.

Sleep and daily timing: Subjective sleep quality is mildly poor (PSQI = 7), which typically co-occurs with higher stress, although objective wearable-derived sleep metrics present a mixed picture. Nightly median sleep duration is relatively long (8 hr 12 min; Z = 1.26) and nightly sleep timing is consistently late (median sleep start ≈ 02:02) with low night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ -0.9). The combination of long, regular but late sleep suggests a stable nocturnal schedule that differs from earlier sleepers; subjective sleep disturbance despite adequate duration could reflect sleep quality issues or mood-related sleep complaints rather than fragmented sleep. Mean daily naps are slightly elevated (Z ≈ 1.27). The modest positive correlation of sleep variability with PSS (r ≈ 0.17) is small, so while sleep timing is atypical it does not strongly contradict a higher perceived stress signal coming from mood and anxiety scales.

Physiological and circadian markers: Cardiac metrics suggest elevated basal physiological arousal. Resting heart rate (≈ 68.6 bpm) and mesor (≈ 80.3) are above the sample mean (both Z ≈ 1.2 and 0.9 respectively), and resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14). Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected strong nocturnal heart-rate troughs and pronounced daytime peaks (largest positive deviations around midday/early afternoon), with the cosinor acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:14 PM). Non-parametric circadian features indicate relatively high interdaily stability (Z ≈ 1.24) and low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -0.67), consistent with a regular, consolidated daily rhythm. Elevated resting physiology in the presence of preserved circadian regularity suggests chronic somatic activation (a correlate of stress/anxiety) rather than highly irregular or disrupted 24-hour organization.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: Several lifestyle factors likely offset some stress-related risks. The participant reports frequent exercise (three times a week or more; Zs > 1.0 across exercise items), limited alcohol and no recreational drug use, and moderate social time. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 40) and current happiness is modestly above average (Z ≈ 0.55), both of which are negatively associated with PSS and can buffer perceived stress. However, substantial engagement in sedentary hobbies and video gaming (Zs up to ≈ 1.7) and a moderate subjective rating of health satisfaction provide a mixed behavioral profile—protective active behaviors coexist with sedentary leisure that may reflect coping or avoidance.

Synthesis and PSS-group judgment: Balancing signals, the strongest and most directly PSS-relevant indicators are elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both above average and positively correlated with PSS), together with modestly elevated resting heart rate and mesor. These converging psychological and physiological signals point toward greater perceived stress relative to peers. Protective factors (regular exercise, high self-esteem, regular circadian structure, relatively long sleep duration) reduce the likelihood of extremely high stress but do not fully offset the upward pressure from mood and anxiety symptom elevations. On balance, the multimodal evidence indicates that this participant’s perceived stress is more consistent with the upper half of the study distribution.

59900,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports relatively low current scores on standard mood and trait measures: CES-D = 13 (z ≈ -0.03; below common cutoffs for elevated depressive symptoms) and STAI–Trait = 37 (z ≈ -0.43). Self-esteem is high (RSES = 39; z = 0.11) and momentary happiness is slightly above the sample mean (score = 4.0; z = 0.55). These measures, together with small negative correlations between self-esteem/happiness and PSS in the provided data, indicate that trait-level affective symptoms are not strongly elevated and do not by themselves point toward high perceived stress in this participant.

Subjective sleep and sleep behavior: The participant reports substantially disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 14, z = 3.37), a pronounced outlier relative to the study population and a notable indicator of sleep-related difficulties. Fitbit-derived sleep duration shows a long median nightly sleep (9 h 22 m; z = 2.71) accompanied by high night-to-night variability (SD = 169 minutes; z = 1.55) and variable sleep start times (median start ~00:10, start-time SD z = 1.19). This pattern—very poor subjective sleep quality combined with long but inconsistent recorded sleep—suggests fragmented or compensatory sleep and an unstable sleep schedule, which are behavioral features often associated with elevated perceived stress and poorer recovery.

Circadian and cardiac physiology (wearable-derived): Cosinor and non-parametric rhythm features indicate weakened circadian structure in heart rate: interdaily stability is low (value 0.32; z = -0.74), intradaily variability is low (z = -1.16 for IV), autocorrelation at 24 h is reduced (z = -1.29), and amplitude from cosinor is attenuated (amplitude = 8.27; z = -0.81). Resting heart rate is near the sample mean (59.1 bpm; z = 0.11). Hourly mean heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir (large negative deviations between ~2–7am) and daytime positive deviations peaking mid‑afternoon, but overall the reduced amplitude and low day-to-day rhythm stability imply weakened daily physiological entrainment. Given the provided correlations (amplitude, autocorrelation, interdaily stability showing small-to-moderate negative associations with PSS), these circadian signatures are consistent with patterns that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.

Activity, social, and health behaviors: The participant reports little to no regular physical activity (exercise/sports reported as “not at all”; large negative z-scores for exercise frequency) and low engagement in some recreational activities (reading, music). Alcohol consumption is occasional (beer and wine 1–2 times per week). Self-rated overall health satisfaction is relatively low (score 2.67; z ≈ -1.2). Low habitual physical activity and lower health satisfaction, in combination with the irregular sleep schedule, represent behavioral risk factors commonly linked to higher stress or reduced stress resilience, even though substance and socialization patterns do not show large deviations from the sample.

Integrated interpretation and PSS grouping: The data present mixed signals: trait measures of depression and anxiety are not elevated and self-esteem and momentary happiness are relatively favorable, which would point toward lower perceived stress. In contrast, sleep-related measures (very high PSQI), marked sleep duration and timing variability, reduced circadian stability/amplitude, low physical activity, and lower health satisfaction are salient and relatively strong indicators associating with higher perceived stress. Several wearable circadian metrics and sleep disturbance show effect directions and z-scores that are more extreme than the small, favorable mood/anxiety scores. On balance—giving particular weight to the very elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI z = 3.37) and the weakened, irregular heart-rate circadian patterns—the overall profile is more consistent with a PSS score in the upper half of the study distribution.

28254,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports low scores on symptom scales linked to negative affective states. CES-D score (6, Z = -0.76) and STAI–Trait score (32, Z = -0.92) both fall below the sample mean, indicating relatively low self-reported depressive and trait anxiety symptoms compared with the study cohort. Self-esteem is at the upper end of the scale (Rosenberg score = 40, Z = 0.26), and general health satisfaction is above the sample mean (5/7, Z = 0.55). Current self-reported happiness is modestly lower than average (3.0, Z = -0.53). Correlations provided in the dataset indicate that CES-D and STAI scores are positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), suggesting that the participant’s low scores on these measures would tend to predict lower perceived stress relative to peers.

Lifestyle and sleep behavior: The participant endorses moderate alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week) and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Exercise frequency is low-to-moderate (exercising alone 1–2 times per week). Daily socializing is below average (reported ~31 minutes per hour, Z = -0.62). Objective and subjective sleep metrics show mixed signals: median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short at 6 h 45 min (Z = -0.53), and the PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7, above the common clinical threshold), though the PSQI Z-score is near the sample mean (Z = 0.13). Sleep start time is late (median ~00:50) with notable night-to-night variability in sleep start (SD ~122 minutes, Z = 0.86) despite relatively low variability in total sleep duration (SD = 45 minutes, Z = -1.26). These sleep features (late bedtimes, disturbed subjective sleep quality, and variability in sleep timing) are behavioral factors that can contribute to elevated perceived stress, although their correlations with PSS in this dataset are modest.

Wearable heart-rate and circadian-summary metrics: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a rhythm with reduced regularity and amplitude relative to the study population. Interdaily stability is low (0.28, Z = -1.07), autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (0.25, Z = -0.61), and amplitude from cosinor analysis is lower than average (8.37, Z = -0.78), consistent with a blunted and less stable circadian pattern. MESOR is close to the sample mean (72.7 bpm, Z = -0.17), and resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to peers (61.9 bpm, Z = 0.45). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected overnight decline and daytime increases with an acrophase in the early afternoon (~1:27 PM); however, the relatively low amplitude and low interdaily stability together suggest less pronounced day–night differentiation in cardiovascular arousal. Correlations provided show small associations between circadian features and PSS (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.17, interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12, resting heart rate r ≈ 0.14), indicating only weak relationships in this sample between these wearable-derived metrics and perceived stress.

Integration and implications for perceived stress: Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress includes low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D and STAI substantially below sample means), high self-esteem, and no reported substance misuse. These self-report indicators are among the strongest correlates of PSS in the dataset and point toward relatively lower perceived stress compared with peers. Countervailing evidence for elevated stress includes disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), late and somewhat irregular sleep timing, reduced circadian regularity and amplitude, and a slightly higher resting heart rate; each of these factors has at least theoretical links to stress and small positive correlations with PSS in the cohort. Overall, the strongest and most directly relevant signals (clinically oriented symptom measures tied to negative affect and anxiety proneness) are in the lower range, while physiological and sleep-related markers are mildly adverse but show only modest associations with PSS in this sample. On balance, the combined profile more closely aligns with participants in the lower half of the PSS distribution rather than the upper half.

35347,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate a relatively low burden of affective symptoms that typically co-occur with perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score (10; Z = -0.34) and STAI–Trait score (31; Z = -1.02) are both below the study mean, suggesting fewer depressive symptoms and lower trait anxiety than most peers; both scales also show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), which implies these low scores argue against high perceived stress. Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES Z ≈ 0.96) and inversely correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), which further supports resilience to perceived stress. Academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.74–3.77), another contextual indicator of functional capacity under academic demands.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators give a mixed but interpretable picture. The participant reports little substance use and minimal team sports or exercise (exercise frequencies with negative Z-scores), and high internet use (more than 4 hours a day; Z = 2.19) alongside extensive time reading (Z = 6.21) and moderate socializing (3–4 hours; Z = 1.74). High sedentary/online time can be associated with stress in some contexts, but here these behaviors co-occur with good academic outcomes and low mood/anxiety symptoms. Trust and momentary happiness are somewhat lower than average (Trust Z ≈ -2.07; Happiness Z ≈ -0.53), which could reflect interpersonal or affective nuance not captured by global anxiety/depression scores, and these dimensions could modestly influence perceived stress although their correlations with PSS are small.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features suggest an overall regular circadian pattern with some atypical timing of sleep and pronounced evening cardiovascular activation. Non-parametric circadian metrics are near the sample mean (interdaily stability value 0.45, Z ≈ 0.33; intradaily variability 0.55, Z ≈ 0.03), indicating a generally regular but not rigid rest–activity structure; interdaily stability is modestly negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.12), so this regularity is consistent with lower perceived stress. Mesor (mean HR) and amplitude are slightly above average (mesor 77.12 bpm, Z ≈ 0.43; amplitude 12.72, Z ≈ 0.63); amplitude shows a small negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.17), which is consistent with the idea that clearer day–night HR variation aligns with lower stress. The acrophase (peak HR) occurs in the early evening (~6:18 PM) and there is a strong positive aggregate deviation at 6–7 PM (≈ +22.6 bpm; Z ≈ 1.75), suggesting predictable evening activity or arousal (social or exercise-related). Resting heart rate is within the sample norm (57.8 bpm, Z ≈ -0.04).

Sleep metrics present a complex signal: objectively, median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 29 m; Z ≈ 1.61) but sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:12) with substantial night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 146 min, Z ≈ 1.04). The participant also naps more often than peers (mean daily naps 0.3, Z ≈ 2.66). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) is classified as disturbed despite objectively long total sleep time. Sleep variability and higher nap frequency both have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.14; naps r ≈ 0.14), which means these aspects could modestly elevate perceived stress or reflect compensatory behavior for fragmented/restless sleep. However, the objective pattern of preserved nightly cardiovascular downregulation across the core sleep window (marked negative HR deviations between ~2–7 AM) suggests preserved physiological recovery during sleep episodes.

Weighing convergent evidence relevant to perceived stress: strong supports for lower PSS come from low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, elevated self-esteem, normative resting physiologic indices, preserved circadian structure, and high academic performance. Features that could point toward elevated or situational stress include disturbed subjective sleep despite long objective sleep, late and variable sleep timing, high internet/sedentary time, lower trust and muted momentary happiness, and modest positive correlations of sleep variability and napping with PSS. Overall, the balance of evidence—particularly the low STAI and CES-D scores (which are among the stronger PSS correlates in the dataset) coupled with generally normal physiological measures—favors a perceived stress level at or below the study median rather than above it.

45641,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological symptom and trait profile: The participant reports elevated internalizing symptoms relative to the study sample. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 22, z ≈ 0.9) are above the population mean and the CES-D score is positively associated with perceived stress in the sample (r ≈ 0.28). Trait anxiety is also elevated (STAI–Trait = 46, z ≈ 0.46) and shows a similar positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is below average (RSES = 32, z ≈ −0.87) and self-reported happiness is reduced (current happiness z ≈ −0.53); these self-concept and affect markers are weakly inversely related to PSS in the sample (negative correlations on the order of r ≈ −0.15 to −0.19), meaning lower self-esteem and happiness here are consistent with higher perceived stress. Taken together, the self-report trait pattern (elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety with lower self-esteem/happiness) is a salient indicator that the participant experiences greater psychosocial burden than many peers.

Behavioral lifestyle context: Health-related behaviors are mixed but include features that commonly co-occur with elevated perceived stress. The participant reports low frequency of exercise and sports (exercise with others and alone both less than 1–2 times per month; sports = not at all; exercise z-scores ~ −0.9 to −1.2) and very limited socializing (socializing time z ≈ −1.41). Sedentary leisure time is relatively high (sedentary hobby time z ≈ +2.01) and screen-based activities (internet usage, video games, watching media) are above average. Substance use is minimal. Lower physical activity and reduced social contact are both behavioral features that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress, and in this sample the relevant self-report measures (exercise, socialization, sedentary time) align with the participant being at behavioral risk for elevated stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: Objective sleep duration is within a higher-than-average range (median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 54 min, z ≈ +0.89), with low napping, and relatively stable sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 50 minutes, z ≈ −0.73). However subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI = 7), indicating a mismatch between duration and perceived restorative sleep. Circadian/heart-rate-derived metrics indicate a structured and regular rhythm: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.58, z ≈ +1.41), amplitude and mesor are elevated (amplitude 13.3, z ≈ +0.81; mesor ≈ 80.0, z ≈ +0.83), and 24-hour autocorrelation is positive (z ≈ +0.81). Resting heart rate is modestly above average (63.2 bpm, z ≈ +0.6). Aggregate hourly deviations show pronounced evening elevations in heart rate relative to the mesor (notably around 9–11 pm, with large positive z-scores), and deeper nocturnal declines during the early morning hours. Overall, the wearable data suggest a well-entrained but late-timed circadian profile (median sleep start near 02:00), evening physiological activation, and modestly elevated basal cardiovascular tone — a pattern consistent with late sleep timing and evening arousal rather than global circadian disruption.

Integration with perceived stress indicators: Several converging lines of evidence point toward elevated perceived stress. The strongest signals are self-report indicators that are moderately correlated with PSS in the sample: elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) both positively correlate with PSS and are above average here. Low self-esteem, reduced happiness, reduced social engagement, and low exercise further align with higher-stress phenotypes. Physiological data are mixed: on the one hand, the participant’s circadian rhythm shows high regularity and adequate sleep duration (factors typically protective or neutral for perceived stress), but on the other hand there is evening physiological activation and a slightly higher resting heart rate — features that can reflect sustained arousal or stress-related sympathetic tone. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) despite adequate duration is also consistent with stress-related sleep complaints. Correlations provided with PSS for many wearable features are small and heterogeneous, so the physiological signals alone are not decisive; however, when combined with the robust self-report symptom elevation, the overall pattern favors placement in the higher half of the PSS distribution.

Overall assessment regarding PSS distribution: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows multiple self-report markers (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low social engagement, disturbed subjective sleep) that are positively associated with perceived stress and are elevated relative to peers. Wearable data provide partial mitigation (regular circadian structure and adequate objective sleep duration) but also indicate evening physiological activation and modestly elevated resting heart rate. Considering the relative magnitude and the known sample correlations, the preponderance of evidence supports classification in the top half of the study population for perceived stress.

Self-esteem is above average (Rosenberg score reported high, Z = 0.54), and substance use is negligible across alcohol and recreational drugs (Z-scores between -0.11 and -1.30). Current happiness and health satisfaction are slightly below the sample mean (happy Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.45), which may reflect transient dissatisfaction but are not accompanied by elevated depression or anxiety scores.

Objective wearable physiology and circadian metrics suggest a regular and robust circadian structure with relatively low basal cardiovascular arousal. Interdaily stability is high (0.61, Z = 1.66), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (Z = 0.39), indicating consistent day-to-day structure in heart-rate rhythms. Resting heart rate and mesor are both low relative to the sample (RHR = 50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93; mesor = 67.23, Z = -0.92), which typically reflect good cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic physiological arousal. Amplitude is modestly above average (Z = 0.49) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:57 PM), consistent with a typical daytime activity peak and reduced nocturnal activity.

Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations and sleep timing show normal nocturnal declines with an identifiable daytime/early-evening elevation pattern. Overnight heart-rate deviations are large and negative (e.g., -20 to -25 bpm relative to mesor across the 2–7 AM window, Z ≈ -1.0 to -1.1), consistent with consolidated physiological sleep and low overnight arousal. Positive deviations across midday and especially evening hours are notable (largest positive Z-scores at 8–9 PM: Z = 2.47; 7–8 PM: Z = 1.77), indicating comparatively higher cardiovascular activation in late afternoon/evening relative to the participant’s mesor—this may reflect evening activity patterns rather than pathological hyperarousal, given low resting HR and high interdaily stability. Median sleep duration is below the sample mean (6 h 38 min, Z = -0.69) with a relatively late median sleep onset (~00:42) and modest night-to-night variability; PSQI score is 6 and classified as disturbed sleep, signifying some subjective sleep difficulties despite wearable-indicated nocturnal dips in heart rate and no daytime napping.

Behavioral context is generally health-promoting and consistent with lower perceived stress. The participant reports weekly solo exercise and sports activity (exercise and sports Z-scores around 0.32 and 0.91 respectively), limited sedentary and recreational excess, and no substance use. Academic performance is adequate (GPA in the low-to-mid 3.0s), and BMI is in a lean range (≈19.1). Several small correlations reported in the dataset link elevated trait symptoms and disturbed sleep to higher PSS in the broader sample, but this participant’s low trait symptom scores and high circadian regularity weigh against an elevated perceived stress profile.

Synthesis and PSS-group determination: Taken together, self-report symptom scales (low CES-D and STAI), favorable physiologic indicators (low resting HR, high interdaily stability), and healthful lifestyle behaviors provide convergent evidence for relatively low to average perceived stress compared with the study population. Areas suggesting some stress-related signal include a PSQI score just above the clinical cutoff, a somewhat short and late sleep schedule, and slightly lower self-reported happiness—these suggest some sleep-related or situational strain but not the broader pattern of elevated psychological distress captured by PSS in this cohort. On balance, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s perceived stress score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

28312,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures show a mixed psychological profile with signals that commonly accompany elevated perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 48, z = 0.66) is above the sample mean and correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), indicating a disposition toward anxiety-proneness that typically co-occurs with higher perceived stress. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are near the population mean (score = 14, z = 0.07) and show a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), suggesting some overlap but not a strong depressive burden. Subjective sleep quality is relatively poor (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05), a robust correlate of perceived stress in many studies; this participant reports disturbed sleep despite an adequate median sleep duration, which often reflects stress-related sleep fragmentation or dissatisfaction. Self-esteem is modestly below average (RSES z = -0.45), and that lower self-esteem has a small negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), consistent with a profile where low self-regard can amplify stress sensitivity.

Lifestyle and behavioral indicators provide additional context that leans toward higher perceived stress. Physical activity is infrequent (exercise alone and with others 1–2 times/month; sports not at all), which removes a common protective buffer against stress. Alcohol use is moderate (beer/wine 1–2 times/week), and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Social time is moderate (1–2 hours/day), and self-reported happiness is slightly above average (score = 4, z = 0.55), which may mitigate stress perception somewhat. Overall, behavioral patterns indicate limited engagement in active stress-reduction behaviors (exercise, sports) but not heavy substance use or severe social isolation; these behaviors are consistent with at least a modest burden of perceived stress when combined with elevated trait anxiety and poor subjective sleep.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics point to pronounced daily cardiovascular rhythm amplitude and an evening acrophase, alongside some markers of regularity and some of irregularity. The cosinor parameters show a relatively high mesor (83.4 bpm, z = 1.30) and high amplitude (15.5, z = 1.54), with acrophase at about 5:32 PM—indicating higher average cardiovascular activation and a strong day–evening peak. Resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the sample (61.7 bpm, z = 0.42). Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are above average (stability z = 0.33; autocorrelation z = 0.90), suggesting consistent daily structure, while intradaily variability is not elevated (z ≈ -0.11). Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~1:23 AM) with notable night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 123 minutes, z = 0.51). Several of these wearable features have modest correlations with PSS in the dataset: greater sleep variability and some markers of physiological activation relate to higher PSS (e.g., sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.14; resting HR r ≈ 0.14), while amplitude and autocorrelation show weak negative correlations with PSS in this sample—indicating complex relations but overall suggesting physiological arousal and late sleep timing that commonly accompany elevated perceived stress.

Weighing evidence for placement in the top versus bottom half of the PSS distribution: evidence consistent with lower or average perceived stress includes a near-mean CES-D score, modest self-reported happiness (z = 0.55), absence of substance misuse, and reasonably regular circadian stability (autocorrelation and interdaily stability above average). Evidence supporting elevated perceived stress includes above-average trait anxiety (STAI z = 0.66 with a meaningful positive correlation to PSS), clinically disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI z = 1.05), late and somewhat variable sleep timing, low habitual physical activity, and wearable indicators of elevated cardiovascular mesor and evening peaks. Considering the relative strength and direction of the associations most closely linked to perceived stress (notably trait anxiety and disturbed sleep, both showing moderate correlations with PSS), and the presence of behavioral patterns that reduce resilience (low exercise, late/variable sleep), the aggregated profile is more consistent with higher perceived stress relative to the study population. On balance, the preponderance of indicators points toward placement in the upper half of the PSS distribution.

Trait anxiety (STAI Trait = 20, Z = -2.11) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 1, Z = -1.28) are both well below the study mean, while self-esteem (Z = 1.66), momentary happiness (Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction (Z = 2.05) are substantially above average. Substance use is reported as absent, and the participant reports frequent exercise and sports activity (exercise with others and sports both Z > 1), all of which typically correspond to lower perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26) is also better than average. Together, these self-report signals strongly favor placement in a lower perceived-stress stratum.

Behavioral patterns from survey items further support low stress exposure or effective coping. The participant reports little time on passive or potentially avoidant activities (very low internet and TV use) and engages in social and structured physical activities at rates above the sample mean. These lifestyle indicators (regular group exercise, frequent sports, minimal substance use, high health satisfaction) are consistent with resources and routines that buffer against perceived stress in student populations.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep present a mixed but interpretable pattern. Objective sleep duration is markedly short (median 5 h 33 min, Z = -2.02), suggesting potential sleep restriction despite subjectively good sleep quality; sleep timing is late (median start ~01:20) with moderate night-to-night variability (start-time SD ~54 min, Z ≈ -0.63). Circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.9) and low 24-h autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.78), indicating that heart-rate–based daily structure is less regular than average. Conversely, resting heart rate is low (44.2 bpm, Z = -1.66) and amplitude of daily HR rhythm is near average, which is compatible with good cardiovascular fitness and substantial daytime activity. Hourly aggregate deviations show expected deep nocturnal reductions in heart rate and robust daytime elevations (peaking midmorning to afternoon), with acrophase near mid-afternoon (~3:10 PM). In sum, wearables suggest a physically fit participant with an irregular, late-timed sleep schedule and objectively short sleep—features that could elevate stress risk but that appear to be counterbalanced by strong psychosocial and behavioral supports.

When weighing convergent evidence relevant to perceived stress, the self-report indicators (very low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, happiness, health satisfaction, active social/exercise engagement, and low substance use) are strong and consistent. Wearable data introduce some cautionary signals (notably short sleep and reduced day-to-day circadian stability), but effect sizes for correlations between these objective features and PSS in this dataset are small. The preponderance of psychometric and behavioral evidence points toward relatively low perceived stress compared with the study sample.

Final determination: bottom 50th percentile for PSS.

26800,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Summary of self-report measures: The participant reports low depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 7, z = -0.66) and an average-to-slightly-above-average level of trait anxiety (STAI = 40, z = -0.13). Self-esteem is relatively elevated compared with the sample (self-esteem z = 0.96). Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5, z = -0.8). Current happiness is modestly below the sample mean (z = -0.53), but overall academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.8–3.9). Taken together, the self-report profile shows protective features (low depressive symptoms, higher self-esteem, satisfactory sleep, strong academic outcomes) with only modest signals that would be expected to accompany substantially elevated perceived stress.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian features: The participant’s resting heart rate is low (49.4 bpm, z = -1.04), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic autonomic arousal. Cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude are both lower than average (mesor z = -0.91; amplitude z = -0.9), indicating a relatively low mean heart rate and attenuated day–night variation in heart rate across the recording period. Non-parametric circadian indices are mixed: interdaily stability is low (0.30, z = -0.9), suggesting weaker day-to-day synchronization, whereas the 24-hour autocorrelation is higher than average (z = 0.64), indicating some consistency at the daily-period level. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected overnight heart rate nadir and a pronounced positive deviation in mid-morning (notably 9–10am, z = 2.2). These wearable patterns suggest a generally low baseline cardiovascular activation with a blunted amplitude of diurnal variation, but with a reproducible morning surge in heart rate. None of these physiologic features show strong correlations with PSS in this participant’s data; correlations provided are small in magnitude.

Sleep timing and variability: Objective sleep duration is within a normative range (median 7 h 14 m, z = 0.06) and sleep variability is modest (SD ~94 min, z ≈ -0.15). Median sleep onset is relatively late (about 1:28 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability. Nap frequency is negligible. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and objective sleep duration/variability together indicate that sleep quantity/quality is unlikely to be a primary driver of elevated perceived stress for this individual.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle context: Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; z ≈ 1.0), recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent, and social activity is moderate (1–2 hours). Reported exercise frequency is low when considered as exercising alone or with others, though “sports” are reported 1–2 times per week (z = 0.91). Sedentary leisure activities are minimal. Overall, these behaviors do not reflect clear high-stress coping patterns (e.g., heavy substance use or pronounced sedentary isolation); instead they align with an academically engaged profile and some protective lifestyle features.

Integrated interpretation relative to perceived stress (PSS): Factors that typically co-occur with lower perceived stress—low depressive symptoms, relatively high self-esteem, adequate sleep, low resting heart rate, and strong academic performance—are prominent in this profile. Countervailing signals for higher perceived stress are modest: trait anxiety is near the sample mean, subjective happiness is slightly lower than average, interdaily stability of circadian heart rate is reduced, and there is a notable morning heart-rate surge. However, these risk signals are small-to-moderate in magnitude and are not supported by stronger indicators such as poor sleep, elevated depressive symptoms, marked autonomic hyperarousal, or maladaptive health behaviors. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the sample distribution for perceived stress.

47142,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report indicators show a mixed but concerning profile with respect to perceived stress. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 19, Z = 0.59) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17); both of these measures correlate positively with PSS in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), suggesting that affective symptom burden and anxiety-proneness are likely contributors to higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 35, Z = -0.45) and health satisfaction is low (3/7, Z = -0.95); both patterns are consistent with greater subjective strain in everyday functioning. Protective or neutral self-report features include relatively low reported sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score = 4, Z = -1.26, classified as “Good Sleep”), minimal substance use, steady academic performance (GPA history above 3.4), and little engagement in organized sports or social exercise; these items may mitigate some stress exposure or its behavioral manifestations but do not eliminate affective symptom signals.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate a generally regular and consolidated daily rhythm coupled with modest elevations in baseline cardiovascular tone. Non-parametric rhythm metrics show relatively high interdaily stability (0.54, Z = 1.08) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (0.50, Z = 1.48), and low intradaily variability (0.36, Z = -1.31). This combination reflects a consistent rest–activity/heart-rate pattern across days, a feature generally associated with better circadian regulation and lower stress vulnerability (and these rhythm metrics correlate weakly in the expected directions with PSS: interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17). At the same time, the participant’s mesor and resting heart rate are above the sample mean (Mesor = 83.6 bpm, Z = 1.32; Resting HR = 65.1 bpm, Z = 0.83). Resting HR shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), which—together with elevated mesor—may reflect higher tonic physiological arousal that can accompany greater perceived stress.

Sleep timing and duration reveal a pattern that could contribute to subjective stress despite a favorable PSQI score. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep is somewhat short (6 h 32 min, Z = -0.81) and median sleep onset is late (around 01:39 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 69 min, Z ≈ -0.31). The participant also naps more than typical peers (mean naps 0.3/day, Z = 2.66), which may reflect compensatory behavior for reduced nocturnal sleep or daytime fatigue. Several sleep timing metrics (sleep start variability, nap frequency) have small positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.15–0.17), indicating these behaviors could be associated with higher perceived stress even though subjective sleep quality was reported as good.

Behavioral context further shapes interpretation: the participant reports low socializing and few shared exercise activities, which reduces social buffering resources, while recreational screen-time and sedentary hobbies are minimal. Exercise occurs alone at low-to-moderate frequency (1–2 times/week). Taken together, the behavioral profile suggests limited social support and modestly active coping outlets—factors that can allow perceived stress to remain elevated when affective symptoms are present.

Integrated appraisal for PSS group membership: multiple converging indicators point toward relatively elevated perceived stress. Moderate elevations in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both positively correlated with PSS), below-average self-esteem and health satisfaction, modestly elevated resting HR/mesor, late and somewhat short nocturnal sleep with increased napping, and limited socializing all align with patterns typically seen in participants reporting higher perceived stress. Circadian regularity and a favorable PSQI score are protective signals, but they do not fully offset the affective and physiological signals that correlate with higher PSS. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports classifying this participant as more likely to fall into the higher half of the PSS distribution in the study population.

60396,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Multimodal psychological-behavioral synthesis:
Self-report measures indicate a profile consistent with relatively low depressive symptom burden and broadly positive psychosocial resources. The participant’s CES-D score is 8 (Z = -0.55), classified as ""not depressed,"" and their Rosenberg self‑esteem score is 33 (Z = -0.73), both of which are features that conventionally relate to lower perceived stress. Current happiness and health satisfaction are both above the sample mean (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.88), and interpersonal trust is elevated (Z = 1.15); these positive subjective indicators point toward adaptive appraisal and social/cognitive resources that typically buffer perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42, Z = 0.07) is near the population mean, suggesting only a mild elevation in anxiety proneness relative to peers, not an extreme level.

Behavioral lifestyle and activity patterns:
Reported lifestyle behaviors include moderate social exercise (exercising with others three or more times per week; Z = 1.23), occasional alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0), and low recreational drug use. Leisure patterns show relatively low overall time spent on internet use and socializing compared with the sample, but the participant nonetheless reports regular group-based exercise, which is a behavioral correlate often associated with lower perceived stress. Academic performance (GPAs reported across semesters) is in a high range, which may reflect effective functioning in academic domains.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Fitbit-derived sleep and circadian measures generally reflect adequate sleep quantity and a well-entrained circadian profile. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 23 minutes (Z = 0.26), with modest night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = -0.69). Sleep onset is comparatively late (median start ≈ 01:46 AM) but not highly irregular (sleep start SD Z = -0.66). The PSQI score is 6 (classified as ""disturbed sleep"") but its Z = -0.33 indicates the participant sleeps subjectively somewhat better than average for this sample despite crossing a common clinical threshold; this suggests some specific sleep complaints but not a pattern of severely impaired sleep quantity. Daily nap frequency is minimal.

Autonomic and circadian rhythm indicators:
Cardiovascular markers point to low resting physiological arousal and strong day-to-day circadian organization. Resting heart rate is low at 49.4 bpm (Z = -1.04), and the cosinor-derived mesor is also lower than average (Z = -1.11). Non‑parametric circadian metrics show low intradaily variability (Z = -1.45), indicating limited within-day fragmentation of activity/heart-rate patterns, and high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.57), indicating stable day-to-day rhythmicity. Peak heart-rate timing (acrophase ~5:52 PM) and the aggregated hourly deviations (notably pronounced nocturnal dips and evening peaks) are consistent with a pronounced diurnal amplitude and consolidated rest at night. Several of these objective rhythm features (high 24‑hour autocorrelation; low intradaily variability; low resting HR) correlate in the sample with lower PSS scores (sample correlations roughly −0.17, +0.16, and +0.14 respectively), and in this participant they are in the protective direction.

Integration and inference about perceived stress (PSS):
Multiple convergent indicators point toward relatively low-to-moderate perceived stress for this participant. Psychological self-reports (low CES-D, above-average self-esteem, above-average happiness and health satisfaction) and behavioral supports (regular group exercise) are protective and align with lower PSS. Objective physiology reinforces that pattern: a low resting heart rate, strong day-to-day circadian regularity, and low intraday fragmentation are each associated with lower stress in the sample and appear pronounced here (Z-scores approximately −1.0 to +1.6 in directions that favor low perceived stress). The primary countervailing signals are a PSQI score of 6 (slightly above the common cutoff for disturbed sleep) and an STAI trait score close to the sample mean (slightly above), which could modestly increase perceived stress risk; however, these are relatively small in magnitude compared with the number and strength of protective indicators. Because the dataset does not include the participant’s PSS raw score, inference must rely on these multi-modal proxies and their sample correlations. On balance, the weight of both subjective and objective evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress is more consistent with the lower half of the study population distribution.

Conclusion:
Based on the overall pattern of low depressive symptoms, above-average self-esteem and happiness, regular social exercise, adequate sleep duration, low resting heart rate, high day-to-day rhythmicity, and low intraday fragmentation—together with only modest elevations in trait anxiety and a marginal PSQI elevation—the participant most likely falls in the bottom 50% of the sample with respect to perceived stress.

92412,16.0,0.04922279792746114,"Self-report indicators consistently point toward relatively low perceived stress and good psychological functioning. The participant reports minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3; Z = -1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 32; Z = -0.92), both of which are correlated positively but modestly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are above average (RSES Z = 0.82; Happiness Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction is also elevated (Z = 0.63). Sleep-related self-report (PSQI = 4; Z = -1.26) indicates subjectively good sleep quality. Lifestyle behaviors are health-promoting: frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others ≥3×/week, Z ≈ 1.1–1.2), no reported alcohol or recreational drug use (strong negative Z-scores for substance use), low sedentary recreational time, and no napping. Academically, GPA values are at the top of the scale. These self-report domains collectively suggest coping resources and daily routines that are typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Objective wearable physiology and circadian features largely corroborate the low-stress picture, while adding nuance. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53 bpm; Z = -0.61) and MESOR is below the study mean (67.4 bpm; Z = -0.89), both patterns that are generally consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic arousal. Circadian amplitude is higher than average (amplitude Z = 0.74), which—given its negative correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.16)—aligns with lower perceived stress and a robust day–night rhythm. Interdaily stability is near average (0.43; Z = 0.17), indicating reasonably consistent day-to-day timing of physiological rhythms.

There is one prominent feature in the hourly heart rate deviations that merits interpretation: a very large positive deviation in the early evening window (5–6 pm: +39.2 bpm; Z = 4.19) and elevated deviations from about 4–7 pm overall. This magnitude is an outlier relative to the study distribution, and the timing aligns with typical post-day activity or exercise periods. Given the participant’s reported frequent exercise and higher amplitude circadian rhythm, the evening heart-rate spike is most consistent with concentrated physical activity or other high-metabolic engagement in that interval rather than sustained stress-related arousal across the day. Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.66; Z = 0.81), a metric that in this sample has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.17); this suggests some within-day fragmentation of activity or transitions, but its effect size and the broader pattern of favorable measures moderate its weight in interpretation.

Sleep objective metrics reinforce a low-stress interpretation. Median nightly sleep duration is healthy (7 h 48 min; Z = 0.76) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD = 62 min; Z = -0.87), and sleep onset timing is moderately late but consistent (median start ~00:54; start SD Z = -0.74). There are no recorded naps (Z = -0.86). Good objective and subjective sleep, together with low depressive and anxiety symptoms and frequent exercise, form a coherent pattern associated with lower perceived stress.

Evidence for elevated perceived stress is limited and small in magnitude: intradaily variability is modestly higher (Z = 0.81) and some early-night heart-rate deviations show small positive correlations with PSS, but these associations are weak relative to the dominant signals from self-report and other wearable metrics. On balance—taking into account low CES-D and STAI scores, high happiness and self-esteem, good sleep quality and regularity, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and minimal substance use—the aggregate pattern supports a PSS level in the lower half of the study distribution.

The participant reports minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 2, Z = -1.18) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02). Subjective well-being indicators are comparatively high: self-reported happiness (score = 5, Z = 1.64), self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66), and health satisfaction (score = 6, Z = 1.3) are all above the cohort mean. Substance use is limited to moderate weekly beer/wine consumption and no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Regular exercise is frequent (exercising alone and with others three+ times per week; Z ≈ 1.1–1.2). Taken together, the self-report domain presents multiple protective factors that typically associate with lower perceived stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data show a mixed picture: median sleep duration is adequate (7 h 36 m, Z = 0.52) and naps are absent (Z = -0.86), yet sleep timing and consistency are irregular. Median sleep start time is late (01:27) with a large night-to-night variability in start time (SD = 114 minutes, Z = 0.69) and in duration (SD = 145 minutes, Z = 1.0). The PSQI score is 6 (slightly above the common threshold for disturbance), indicating some subjective sleep difficulties despite average total sleep time. Circadian summary metrics reflect modest weakening of daily regularity: interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.39, Z = -0.16) and intradaily variability—an index of fragmentation—is elevated (0.72, Z = 1.23). These features suggest an otherwise sufficient sleep quantity coexisting with irregular timing and greater within-day fragmentation, patterns that have modest positive associations with perceived stress in this sample.

Physiological activity patterns from heart-rate metrics are consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and pronounced diurnal modulation rather than chronic hyperarousal. Resting heart rate is low (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56), and the cosinor amplitude is relatively large (amplitude = 13.83, Z = 0.99) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈5:12 PM), indicating a clear day–night difference in heart rate. Hourly aggregated deviations show large negative deviations during typical sleep hours and prominent positive deviations across mid- to late-afternoon (peaks at 3–5 PM with high Z-scores >2), consistent with daytime activity rather than sustained elevated baseline arousal. Most hourly heart-rate deviations have small correlations with PSS (both positive and negative, generally modest), so the wearable physiological profile does not provide strong evidence of chronically elevated sympathetic tone.

Weighing evidence for lower versus higher perceived stress: indicators favoring lower PSS include very low depressive and trait anxiety symptom scores, high self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, and adequate median sleep duration. Indicators that could support higher PSS are the elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.23), substantial night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (Z = 0.69–1.0), and a PSQI just above the cutoff (score = 6); these features have small positive correlations with PSS in this sample. Overall, the magnitude and convergence of low symptom scores and positive psychosocial resources outweigh the relatively modest signals of sleep timing irregularity and circadian fragmentation.

Conclusion: on balance, the multimodal evidence indicates that this participant’s pattern of responses and wearable-derived metrics is more consistent with a perceived stress level in the lower half of the study distribution.

Self-reported current happiness is relatively elevated (score = 4.0, Z ≈ 0.55). Together these trait and state measures that typically correlate positively with perceived stress (CES‑D and STAI correlations with PSS ~0.28–0.31) point away from a high perceived stress burden for this participant.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators further support a lower-stress interpretation. The participant reports minimal substance use (alcohol and recreational drug use reported as “not at all”), limited solitary exercise frequency but participation in sports (1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 0.91), and modest social engagement (socializing ~1–2 hours daily). Health satisfaction and trust are around the sample mean, and academic performance (GPA around 3.7–3.75) is strong. These patterns—low substance exposure, regular sport participation, and satisfactory academic/health indicators—are not characteristic of high perceived stress in this sample.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep provide a largely consistent picture. Resting heart rate is relatively low (51 bpm, Z ≈ -0.85) and the mesor of hourly heart rate is lower than average (64.7, Z ≈ -1.27), suggesting relatively low baseline cardiovascular arousal and possibly better cardiorespiratory fitness; both are features associated with lower stress exposure in many cohorts. Circadian metrics show modestly reduced amplitude and only slightly lower interdaily stability (amplitude Z ≈ -0.6; interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.16) while 24‑hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z ≈ 0.48), indicating generally consistent day‑to‑day patterns but somewhat blunted rhythm amplitude. Intradaily variability is near average-to-slightly-elevated (Z ≈ 0.1), suggesting some within-day fragmentation but not extreme. Sleep duration is close to normative for the sample (median ≈ 7 h, Z ≈ -0.21) though the PSQI score indicates some subjective disturbance (PSQI = 7), which may reflect sleep quality concerns but is only mildly elevated relative to peers.

Integrative synthesis with respect to perceived stress: convergent evidence from affective trait measures (low CES‑D and STAI, high self‑esteem and happiness), healthy lifestyle markers (minimal substance use, regular sport participation), and physiological indicators of low resting cardiovascular arousal support the conclusion that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress. The main countervailing signals are a PSQI indicating some subjective sleep disturbance and modest intradaily variability in rhythm, but these are small in magnitude and unlikely, in the context of the other measures, to place the participant above the sample median on the PSS.

29792,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but overall resilient psychological profile. Depressive symptom scores are low (CES-D = 13; Z ≈ -0.03) while trait anxiety is slightly elevated relative to the sample (STAI = 43; Z ≈ 0.17), and correlates positively with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31), suggesting anxiety proneness is a modest risk factor for perceiving more stress. Self-esteem is at the top of the scale (RSES = 40; Z ≈ 0.26) and happiness and trust ratings are above average (happiness Z ≈ 0.55; trust Z ≈ 0.83), factors that generally associate with lower perceived stress (self-esteem correlation with PSS r ≈ -0.15). Overall, affective and self-concept markers (high self-esteem, above-average happiness, low depressive burden) provide behavioral evidence of psychological resources that would mitigate perceived stress, while modestly elevated trait anxiety represents the primary self-report vulnerability.

Sleep and circadian behavior present an important counterpoint. Objective sleep from the wearable shows a short median sleep duration (6 h 11 m; Z ≈ -1.25) and a very late median sleep-start time (around 4:32 AM), together with a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7; Z ≈ 0.13). Short, late, and subjectively disturbed sleep are well-established correlates of higher perceived stress; in this dataset, several sleep and circadian features show small correlations with PSS in the expected directions (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16, sleep variability r ≈ 0.14). Circadian summary metrics show modest interdaily stability (0.46; Z ≈ 0.42) and relatively low autocorrelation at 24 h (Z ≈ -1.12), indicating some inconsistency in day-to-day rhythm strength despite a moderately regular within-day pattern. The late sleep timing and reduced sleep opportunity are therefore meaningful behavioral features that could increase perceived stress.

Physiological measures from the wearable moderate the interpretation further. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52 bpm; Z ≈ -0.73), and overall heart-rate mesor is somewhat below the sample mean (mesor ≈ 69.9; Z ≈ -0.55), which are generally consistent with lower tonic physiological arousal. Hourly aggregated deviations reveal expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate and evening elevations with an acrophase in the early evening (≈ 7:39 PM). The amplitude of the rhythm is near sample average. Several heart-rate–derived circadian metrics correlate weakly with PSS (e.g., autocorrelation 24h r ≈ -0.17, amplitude r ≈ -0.17), but the participant’s low resting HR and moderate circadian amplitude are more characteristic of lower baseline physiological stress than of high sustained arousal.

Behavioral patterns around socializing, exercise, and substance use are mixed with implications for perceived stress. The participant reports frequent group exercise (≥3x/week; Z ≈ 1.23) and modest social time, both of which are commonly associated with lower perceived stress and better coping. At the same time, alcohol consumption (beer three times a week or more; Z ≈ 1.72) and elevated video-game time (Z ≈ 1.71) are notable and can be either coping behaviors or independent lifestyle choices; correlations with PSS in this dataset are small. Academic performance indicators (GPA ~3.2–3.4) and high health satisfaction also point toward functional adaptation rather than marked dysfunction.

Holistic integration for PSS group assignment: the profile shows both risk and protective signals. The clearest risk signals for elevated perceived stress are disturbed, late, and short sleep and a modest elevation in trait anxiety—both of which correlate positively with PSS in the sample. Protective signals include low depressive symptoms, very high self-esteem, above-average happiness and trust, frequent social/group exercise, low resting heart rate, and reasonable daytime functioning. Given the balance of evidence, the protective and physiological markers are relatively strong and consistent while the risk markers are present but moderate in magnitude. Considering the relative sizes of Z-scores and the pattern of correlations with PSS, the preponderance of evidence supports placement of this participant in the lower half (bottom 50%) of the PSS distribution (i.e., low-to-moderate perceived stress), although sleep timing and trait anxiety identify potential targets for intervention to reduce stress further.

14737,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Psychological trait and symptom profile: On self-report measures the participant shows a modestly elevated trait anxiety score (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) and a near‑population‑average level of depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 14, Z = 0.07). Self‑esteem is somewhat below the sample mean (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59) and current self‑reported happiness is slightly above average (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55). Health satisfaction and trust are below average (Z ≈ -0.5 to -0.8). Because trait anxiety is positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31) and self‑esteem and happiness are negatively correlated (r ≈ -0.15 and -0.19, respectively), the self‑report pattern is mixed but includes notable signals (elevated trait anxiety, reduced self‑esteem) that are consistent with higher perceived stress.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability: Wearable and self‑reported sleep metrics indicate short and irregular sleep. Median nightly sleep is approximately 6h3m (Z = -1.41), with large night‑to‑night variability in both duration (SD ≈ 133 min, Z = 0.74) and sleep start time (median start ≈ 01:47, start SD ≈ 135 min, Z = 1.14). The PSQI score is 6 (classified as disturbed sleep). Several of these sleep features (shorter duration, greater variability) have small positive correlations with PSS in the dataset, and the late, variable bedtimes and disturbed subjective sleep increase the likelihood that the participant experiences higher perceived stress or stress‑related sleep disruption.

Circadian and heart rate dynamics: Heart rate circadian features are overall fairly regular, with a modestly above‑average amplitude (Amplitude Z = 0.53) and interdaily stability slightly above average (Z = 0.33). Intradaily variability is elevated (Z = 0.67), which in the study sample is weakly positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), whereas measures indexing stronger circadian organization (amplitude, autocorrelation at 24 h) are negatively correlated with PSS. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm, Z = -0.47), and the daytime aggregate deviations indicate a pronounced evening elevation around 6–7pm (largest positive deviation, Z = 1.65) with deep overnight troughs; these features point to preserved, somewhat robust circadian modulation of heart rate despite higher within‑day variability. Overall, objective physiology shows mixed evidence: circadian structure that could be protective, alongside intraday irregularity that modestly tracks with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral context and lifestyle: The participant reports minimal substance use and limited social or team exercise (exercise alone 1–2x/month; exercise with others none). Sedentary hobby time is relatively high (Z = 1.41). Academic performance is strong (GPA records). These lifestyle markers are largely neutral or protective with respect to PSS (e.g., low substance use) but the low socializing and low frequency of exercise could reduce psychosocial buffering against stress. Self‑reported happiness being above average and low depressive symptoms are countervailing factors that reduce the likelihood of very high perceived stress.

Holistic assessment of perceived stress placement: Integrating modalities, there are multiple indicators pointing toward elevated perceived stress: elevated trait anxiety (STAI), disturbed and short sleep with high variability, and increased intradaily variability in heart rate—each of which shows positive associations with PSS in the sample. Countervailing signals include low resting heart rate, preserved circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, minimal substance use, and above‑average momentary happiness, which temper the inference. On balance, however, the constellation of elevated anxiety proneness together with sleep disruption and within‑day physiological irregularity more consistently aligns with participants in the higher half of the PSS distribution.

28653,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a low-to-average burden of psychological symptoms and positive psychosocial resources. The participant’s depressive symptom score on the CES-D (6; Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety score on the STAI (29; Z = -1.22) are both below the study mean, consistent with relatively low levels of reported mood and anxiety symptoms. Self-esteem and momentary well-being are elevated (Rosenberg Z = 1.52; current happiness Z = 1.64), and global health satisfaction and interpersonal trust are well above average (health satisfaction Z = 1.63; trust Z = 1.79). These self-report indicators are directionally consistent with lower perceived stress, given small-to-moderate positive correlations between CES-D/STAI and PSS in the sample.

Sleep and sleep-related reports align with preserved restorative patterns rather than sleep disturbance. The PSQI score (4; Z = -1.26) falls in the range characterized as good sleep quality, and the wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration is long relative to the cohort (8 h 4 min; Z = 1.10) with no habitual daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is modest (SD ≈ 100 minutes; Z ≈ -0.03) and sleep start time shows moderate variability (SD ≈ 107 minutes; Z = 0.53). Overall, subjective and objective sleep features are more consistent with lower perceived stress than with patterns commonly associated with chronic high stress (short or highly fragmented sleep).

Circadian and cardiovascular metrics from the wearable show a robust, regular rhythm and relatively low physiological arousal at rest. Nonparametric rhythm measures indicate high interdaily stability (0.58; Z = 1.41) and very low intradaily variability (0.25; Z = -2.08), suggesting consistent day-to-day structure and limited fragmentation of activity/heart-rate patterns. Cosinor-derived amplitude is substantially elevated (17.77; Z = 2.26) while MESOR is near the sample mean (74.33; Z = 0.05) and acrophase occurs in the mid-afternoon (~3:42 PM). Resting heart rate is below average (53 bpm; Z = -0.61). Collectively, these features (higher rhythm amplitude and stability, lower intraday variability, lower resting HR) generally correspond to better-regulated physiology and are associated in this dataset with lower PSS scores.

Daily behavior and lifestyle factors further support an interpretation of relatively low perceived stress. The participant reports low substance use, frequent exercise—particularly exercising with others (three times a week or more; Z = 1.23)—and low engagement in prolonged sedentary leisure activities. Socializing time is modest but present, and academic performance (GPAs listed) is high. These behavioral patterns (regular social/exercise engagement, low substance use) are plausibly protective and consistent with the other indicators of low stress.

Integrative evaluation and PSS-group assignment: across domains the data converge on a profile compatible with lower perceived stress relative to the study sample. Low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, elevated self-esteem and well-being, objectively long and regular sleep, high circadian rhythm stability and amplitude, and a low resting heart rate together argue against placement in the upper half of the PSS distribution. Although no direct individual PSS total score is provided here, the preponderance of measures that correlate with PSS point toward the bottom half (lower/average) of the cohort distribution.

95559,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Psychological self-report and symptom measures indicate a generally low affective symptom burden that would be expected to track with lower perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score (8) and trait anxiety (STAI = 29) both sit well below the study mean (CES-D Z = -0.55; STAI Z = -1.22), and self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg, Z = 0.96). These three measures have small-to-moderate expected relationships with perceived stress in the sample (CES-D and STAI correlations with PSS are positive, self-esteem correlation is negative). Taken together, the pattern of low depressive and trait anxiety symptoms and elevated self-esteem is most consistent with a lower-than-average level of chronic perceived stress.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian metrics give a mixed but overall modestly reassuring physiological profile. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.1 bpm, Z = -0.48), which often aligns with lower chronic autonomic arousal; the mesor is slightly below average (71.4 bpm, Z = -0.35). Cosinor-derived amplitude is reduced (7.19, Z = -1.16) and interdaily stability is notably low (0.17, Z = -1.98), indicating a weaker, less regular day-to-day structure in heart-rate rhythms. While reduced circadian regularity (low interdaily stability) can be associated with behavioral irregularity and has complex links to stress, correlations with PSS in this dataset are small. Overall, the physiological profile suggests relatively low baseline cardiovascular arousal but also reduced circadian robustness, a combination that does not point strongly toward high perceived stress when considered alongside the low symptom scores.

Sleep and behavioral habits present more ambiguity and some stress-relevant features. Subjective sleep quality is rated in the disturbed range (PSQI = 7) and median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 hr 39 min, Z = -0.66), with a very late median sleep start time (about 02:10). Day-to-day sleep timing variability is moderately elevated (sleep start SD ≈ 88 minutes) and average nap frequency is high relative to the sample (0.25 naps/day, Z = 2.07). Alcohol use (beer three+ times per week, Z = 1.72) and late bedtimes could reflect social habits or coping strategies; in this sample these behaviors have small correlations with PSS. The combination of late and somewhat variable sleep with subjective sleep disturbance could support modestly elevated momentary stress or lifestyle-related strain, but these sleep features are counterbalanced by the low affective symptom scores and low resting heart rate.

Behavioral engagement and social indices are mixed but not strongly indicative of elevated perceived stress. The participant reports moderate social time and leisure (listening to music high; socializing ~1–2 hours/day) and low engagement in sedentary or solitary hobbies like gaming or reading; exercise frequency is low-to-moderate. Self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are a bit below the sample mean (happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.53) which could reflect situational dissatisfaction but are not strongly correlated with PSS in this dataset. Substance use (frequent beer consumption) stands out behaviorally but shows minimal correlation with PSS in the available metrics.

Holistic synthesis and PSS group assignment: weighing the strongest and most directly relevant indicators—low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.22), low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = -0.55), and relatively high self-esteem (Z = 0.96)—against more modest stress-related signals from sleep timing and circadian stability, the preponderance of evidence supports the participant having a perceived stress level at or below the sample median. Physiological markers (low resting HR, modest mesor) and the small magnitude of correlations linking the less favorable behaviors to PSS further tilt the balance toward lower perceived stress. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half (lower/average perceived stress) of the study distribution.

30152,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Self-report (trait and symptom) profile:
The participant’s self-report measures present a mixed but overall modest symptom burden. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11, z = -0.24) and trait anxiety (STAI = 41, z = -0.03) are near or slightly below the study mean, indicating no marked elevation in depressive or trait-anxiety symptoms relative to peers. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 36, z = -0.31), and global health satisfaction is notably elevated (6/7, z = 1.3), both of which are psychosocial indicators that typically relate to lower perceived stress. Conversely, the participant reports lower momentary happiness and modest trust in others (happiness z = -0.53; trust z = -0.46), and the PSQI score (7, z = 0.13) indicates subjective sleep disturbance above common cutoffs. Behavioral reports show frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more, z = 1.07), low use of recreational drugs and beer, and moderate wine consumption (1–2×/week, z = 0.94). Overall, self-report data contain some protective signals (health satisfaction, exercise, self-esteem) and some stress-relevant signals (disturbed sleep, reduced happiness/trust), with trait symptom measures approximately average.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signals:
Cardiovascular and circadian features derived from Fitbit heart rate indicate a generally low resting and baseline cardiac profile alongside some circadian irregularity. Resting heart rate is low (49.4 bpm, z = -1.04) and the MESOR is reduced (62.67, z = -1.54), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic physiological arousal. Cosinor amplitude is near average-to-low (z = -0.06) and acrophase falls in the late afternoon (≈5:17 PM), indicating the daily heart rate peak occurs late in the day. Nonparametric circadian metrics point to reduced day-to-day rhythm regularity: interdaily stability is below average (0.35, z = -0.49) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (z = -1.45), which together suggest less consistent scheduling across days. Intradaily variability is near the cohort mean (z ≈ -0.04), indicating no pronounced fragmentation of activity within days. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show pronounced positive departures in mid-to-late afternoon (3–6 PM; large positive z-scores up to ~2.3) and deep nocturnal declines (3–6 AM values ~ -16 bpm), implying strong daytime physiological activation in the late afternoon along with a robust overnight heart rate nadir.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Wearable sleep measures indicate relatively short and irregular sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is below 7 hours (6 h 48 min, z = -0.48) and sleep onset is very late on average (median sleep start ≈ 02:28 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 102 minutes, z = 0.41; sleep duration SD ≈ 118 minutes, z = 0.39). Mean daily naps are rare. Together these features show a late chronotype and inconsistent sleep schedule, both of which are commonly associated with stress, daytime impairment, and poorer subjective sleep quality, even when total symptom scores are not markedly elevated.

Integration and implications for perceived stress (PSS):
When synthesizing multimodal information, evidence is mixed but leans toward an average-to-lower perceived stress classification within the study cohort. Indicators supporting lower or average perceived stress include near-average trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores, relatively high self-esteem and health satisfaction, and a low resting heart rate—all of which are associated with lower perceived stress or better physiological resilience. Indicators that could point toward elevated perceived stress are disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), late and inconsistent sleep timing, reduced interdaily rhythm regularity, lower momentary happiness/trust, and prominent late-afternoon physiological activation; these features have plausible links to greater perceived stress but show small correlations with PSS in this dataset. Several of the wearable circadian metrics that suggest irregularity (interdaily stability, autocorrelation at 24 h) have only modest correlations with PSS in the study and the participant’s symptom scales (CES-D, STAI) are not elevated relative to peers. Balancing protective and risk signals and taking into account the magnitude of z-scores and correlations, the overall profile is more consistent with a PSS placement at or below the study median rather than the top half of the distribution.

59592,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological trait and symptom profile: The participant displays a mixed affective profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) and low-to-moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07). Trait anxiety shows one of the stronger positive correlations with perceived stress in the dataset (r ≈ 0.31), and the CES-D score also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), suggesting these self-report scales provide meaningful signals relevant to perceived stress. Self-esteem is above the population mean (RSES = 35, Z = −0.45) and correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), implying some psychological resources that would be protective against stress. Self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are below average (happiness Z ≈ −0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ −0.45), which is consistent with a modestly elevated affective burden even if not meeting thresholds for clinically significant depression.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular indicators: Heart rate–based circadian summary measures point to reduced rhythm robustness and greater within-day fragmentation. Interdaily stability is low (0.30, Z ≈ −0.90) and amplitude is reduced (6.93, Z ≈ −1.25); intradaily variability is relatively high (0.78, Z ≈ 1.65). Autocorrelation at 24 h is below average (Z ≈ −0.53). Together these indicate a circadian pattern that is less consolidated across days and more fragmented within days—a pattern that, in this dataset, is modestly associated with higher PSS (correlations in the range of ±0.10–0.20). Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (66.1 bpm, Z ≈ 0.95) and shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), which is consistent with greater physiological arousal at rest. The hourly aggregated deviations show substantial nocturnal heart rate dips (large negative deviations between ~2:00–7:00 AM) and relatively elevated evening values (notably ~6–8 PM), indicating a clear day–night contrast but with reduced circadian amplitude overall; several of these hourly deviations have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.10–0.21), suggesting some alignment between heart rate patterns and perceived stress in this participant.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep quality: Objective sleep duration is close to seven hours (median 6 h 57 min, Z ≈ −0.29) and nightly variability in start time is low (sleep start SD ≈ 39 minutes, Z ≈ −0.97). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z ≈ −0.8) is rated as relatively good. These sleep metrics do not indicate prominent sleep deprivation or marked night-to-night instability and therefore provide evidence against severe sleep-related contributors to elevated perceived stress. That said, the participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median start ≈ 01:49), which, combined with the circadian fragmentation metrics above, could reflect evening-oriented routines that interact with stress-related processes.

Lifestyle, social, and behavioral context: The participant reports limited substance use (no recreational/non-prescribed drugs; beer infrequently), but weekly wine/liquor consumption is above average (Z ≈ 0.94). Exercise is modest (exercising alone 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 0.32) and social/exercise engagement with others is low (Z ≈ −0.88 for exercising with others). Daily leisure is skewed toward screen-based sedentary activities (watching videos Z ≈ 1.28; internet usage Z ≈ 0.85) and limited reading or sports participation. Academic performance (GPAs) is high. The behavioral profile suggests limited social exercise engagement and relatively sedentary evening routines, both of which can be associated with higher perceived stress or fewer buffering activities.

Integrative interpretation regarding perceived stress: Weighing the multimodal evidence, there are convergent signals indicative of elevated perceived stress. The participant’s trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores—both positively correlated with PSS—are notable contributors. Physiological data show reduced circadian amplitude, low interdaily stability, and elevated intradaily variability, which together reflect a less consolidated daily structure; these wearable-derived features are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample and complement the self-report anxiety signal. Elevated resting heart rate provides a small additional physiological indicator of increased arousal. Countervailing evidence includes generally adequate sleep duration and subjective sleep quality, low variability in sleep timing, relatively high self-esteem, absence of recreational drug use, and strong academic performance, all of which argue against extremely elevated perceived stress. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (particularly trait anxiety and circadian fragmentation plus modest physiological arousal) supports a somewhat elevated level of perceived stress relative to the study sample.

Overall PSS group assignment: Considering the combination of elevated trait anxiety, modest depressive symptoms, circadian irregularity (high intradaily variability and low amplitude/interdaily stability), and an elevated resting heart rate—balanced against reasonably good subjective sleep and some protective factors—I judge the participant’s perceived stress level to be more consistent with the upper half of the sample distribution.

89652,28.0,0.961139896373057,"The self-report profile indicates generally low affective symptom burden and favorable psychosocial resources. Scores on depression (CES-D = 5) and trait anxiety (STAI-T = 35) are both below the study mean (negative z-scores) and are described as “not depressed” and “not anxious,” respectively. Self-reported happiness and trust are elevated (happiness z = 1.64; trust z = 2.75) and health satisfaction is near the population mean. Reported self-esteem is relatively high (z = 0.82), though the raw self-esteem value appears inconsistent with the scale range and should be interpreted cautiously. The participant reports virtually no substance use and engages in modest sport activity (1–2 times per week) with only infrequent exercise sessions otherwise. Taken together, the survey measures paint a picture of a student with low reported mood and anxiety symptoms, positive social valuation, and limited substance-related risk behaviors — a profile that tends to align with lower perceived stress.

Objective sleep and sleep-timing metrics from the wearable show features that diverge from the participant’s subjective sleep quality. The median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 34 min (z = -0.76), shorter than average, and sleep timing is quite late (median sleep start about 02:54) with elevated night-to-night variability in both duration (SD = 172 min, z = 1.62) and start time (SD z = 0.51). Mean daily naps are infrequent but above the study median (z = 1.49). Despite objectively shorter and irregular sleep timing, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality on the PSQI (score = 4, z = -1.26). In the context of perceived stress, increased sleep variability and late, irregular sleep timing are small but positive correlates of higher PSS in the sample; thus, the wearable-derived sleep irregularity represents a potential behavioral risk factor for elevated perceived stress even when subjective sleep quality is reported as good.

Circadian and cardiac activity features indicate a moderately irregular 24-hour structure and distinct daytime arousal. Non-parametric circadian metrics show somewhat reduced stability and increased fragmentation: interdaily stability is near average (z = 0.17) while intradaily variability is elevated (z = 1.3), and 24-hour autocorrelation is low (z = -0.87). Parametric measures show a mesor near the sample mean (≈73 bpm) and modest amplitude, with peak heart rate timing in the late afternoon (acrophase ≈ 4:37 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly above average (60.3 bpm, z = 0.26). Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor follow an expected overnight nadir (largest negative deviations during early morning) and daytime peaks in the mid-to-late afternoon (largest positive deviation at 3–4 PM, z = 1.61). The pattern of elevated intradaily variability combined with a clear daytime peak suggests frequent within-day fluctuations in activity/arousal rather than a blunted diurnal rhythm; in this sample, higher intradaily variability and some sleep irregularity have small positive correlations with PSS, indicating these wearable features could modestly reflect stress-related dysregulation.

Synthesizing multimodal evidence, subjective measures (low depression and anxiety scores, high happiness and trust, good PSQI) strongly favor placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Objective wearable measures introduce modest countervailing signals — late and variable sleep timing and elevated intradaily variability are small-sample correlates of higher perceived stress — but their effect sizes and z-scores are modest relative to the robustly low symptom reports. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (particularly self-reported emotional and sleep health) supports classification of this participant as having relatively lower perceived stress compared with the study population.

28724,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report measures point toward relatively low affective symptom burden and preserved psychosocial resources. The participant’s CES-D score is low (6; Z = -0.76) indicating few depressive symptoms during the assessment window. Trait anxiety on the STAI is near the study mean (40; Z = -0.13) and while labeled “anxious” per the instrument’s descriptor, it does not represent an extreme elevation relative to peers. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 39; Z = 0.11) and current self-reported happiness is substantially above average (score = 5.0; Z = 1.64). Health satisfaction is modestly below average but not markedly so. Together, these self-report indicators describe a profile with generally positive mood and self-regard and only modest or average levels of chronic anxiety—features that would be expected to co-occur with lower perceived stress.

Sleep subjectively and by wearable-derived timing/duration is broadly favorable. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 49 minutes (Z = 0.79), which is longer than the study average, and night-to-night duration variability is relatively low (SD = 65 minutes; Z = -0.81). Sleep start times are centered near midnight with a small standard deviation (≈28 minutes; Z = -1.22), indicating consistent bedtimes. The PSQI is 6, which crosses the common threshold for “disturbed sleep,” but its Z-score relative to the population is only modestly negative (Z = -0.33) and objective sleep metrics here suggest adequate duration and regular timing. Overall, sleep quantity and timing provide support for lower perceived stress rather than a pattern of chronic sleep disruption.

Passive wearable physiology and circadian features show some mixed indications. Heart rate mesor and amplitude are slightly below population averages (mesor Z = -0.45; amplitude Z = -0.57) and resting heart rate is low-normal (59.8 bpm; Z = 0.2), consistent with reasonable cardiovascular baseline tone. However, non-parametric circadian metrics point to less stable daily structure (interdaily stability Z = -0.74) and relatively high intradaily variability (Z = 1.51), which can reflect more fragmented or irregular activity transitions across the day. The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and pronounced daytime peaks (notably around late morning and early afternoon; e.g., 1–2 pm deviation Z = 2.10), suggesting consistent periods of daytime physiological arousal. The associations between these circadian features and PSS in the study are modest (correlations generally small), so the wearable-derived irregularity raises a potential concern for stress-linked rhythm disruption but is not definitive on its own.

Behavioral and lifestyle indices further contextualize stress risk and resilience. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times a week or more; Z = 1.07), low use of recreational or non-prescribed substances, moderate socializing (1–2 hours/day), and limited sedentary or gaming behaviors. Academically, recent GPAs are strong. These health-promoting behaviors—regular exercise, low substance use, social engagement and stable sleep patterns—are consistent with lower perceived stress. The main discrepant signal is the wearable-derived circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability and low interdaily stability), which could reflect variability in daily activity schedules or measurement of brief daytime transitions rather than chronic stress per se.

Integration and conclusion regarding perceived stress: convergent evidence from self-report mood, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, adequate and regular sleep, frequent exercise, and minimal substance use suggests the participant’s perceived stress is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution. Wearable circadian irregularity introduces a cautionary note, but its correlations with PSS are small and other objective and subjective indicators more strongly point toward lower perceived stress. On balance, the preponderance of evidence favors assignment to the bottom 50% of the PSS distribution.

69831,16.0,0.04922279792746114,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant’s self-report symptom scores are generally lower than the study mean. CES-D score of 10 (z = -0.34) and STAI–Trait score of 38 (z = -0.33) both fall below the sample average and are classified as “not depressed” and “not anxious,” respectively; these scales are positively correlated with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31), so the participant’s relatively low depressive and trait-anxiety scores point toward lower perceived stress. Rosenberg self-esteem is relatively high (36, z ≈ -0.31 in the sample coding where higher scores indicate greater self-esteem), which has a small negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), again consistent with lower perceived stress. Self-rated happiness is somewhat below average (current = 3.0, z = -0.53), and health satisfaction is notably low (2.67, z = -1.20), but these items have small sample correlations with PSS and therefore are weaker, mixed indicators.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable and subjective sleep indicators are generally consistent with adequate sleep duration but a late, regular schedule. Median Fitbit sleep duration is 8 hours (z = +1.01), and reported PSQI = 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep” though its z = -0.33 relative to the sample), producing a mixed picture in which objective duration is higher than average while subjective sleep quality is borderline poor. The median sleep start time is late (≈01:35 AM) with low variability of start time (SD ≈ 35 minutes, z = -1.05), indicating a stable but late sleep schedule. Circadian heart-rate metrics show a modestly low interdaily stability (0.38, z = -0.24) and low intradaily variability (0.44, z = -0.74). Resting heart rate and mesor are below the sample mean (RHR 56 bpm, z = -0.26; mesor ≈ 71.7 bpm, z = -0.31), and the cosinor acrophase is in the late afternoon (≈4:43 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions and pronounced afternoon/evening elevations (largest positive deviations ~6–8 PM). Many of these wearable features have only small correlations with PSS in the sample, but the pattern of lower resting HR, stable sleep timing, and lower intradaily variability tends to align with lower perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: The participant reports limited formal exercise (no solitary or group exercise, z-scores strongly negative) but participates in sports 1–2 times per week (z ≈ 0.91). Recreational profile includes high socializing and music-listening (both >4 hours, z-scores > +2.0 and +2.5) and relatively high internet and passive-media time; sedentary hobbies are elevated. Substance use is moderate (beer and liquor 1–2 times weekly; drug use absent). Low BMI (15.6) is a notable physical-health data point; while BMI has complex relations with stress, in this dataset it is an outlying physical characteristic rather than a direct indicator of perceived stress. Overall, high social engagement and abundant leisure time are behavioral features that typically relate to lower perceived stress, while low exercise frequency is a potential risk factor but appears to be outweighed here by other protective behaviors.

Synthesis and inference regarding perceived stress (PSS): Multiple sources converge on a conclusion of relatively low-to-average perceived stress. The participant’s low CES-D and STAI scores (both below the sample mean) are the strongest psychological indicators because these symptom scales correlate positively with PSS in the sample; their low values therefore point toward a PSS below the study median. Wearable physiology likewise provides supportive evidence: low resting heart rate and low intradaily variability (both associated in the sample with lower PSS) and a stable sleep start time are consistent with lower perceived stress. Countervailing signals are modest: PSQI = 6 (borderline disturbed sleep) and lower self-rated happiness and health satisfaction could indicate some subjective strain, but these measures have smaller sample correlations with PSS and are not strongly corroborated by objective physiology. Taking the pattern of self-report and wearable measures together, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress level would fall in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., not in the highest 50%).

44927,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report psychological profile and symptom burden: The participant reports low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 6; Z = -0.76) and generally favorable self-regard (Rosenberg Self-Esteem = 32; Z = -0.87). Trait anxiety is near the sample mean (STAI = 40; Z = -0.13) with a modest positive association between trait anxiety and PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.31), but the participant’s STAI score does not deviate substantially from peers. Self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are slightly below the sample mean (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.45). Taken together, these self-report indices indicate relatively few internalizing symptoms and generally adaptive self-evaluations, with only modest evidence of anxiety-related risk that could contribute to perceived stress.

Behavioral lifestyle and activities: The participant reports minimal substance use (alcohol and drugs all “not at all,” Z-scores between -1.3 and -0.1) and high engagement in sports (three times per week or more; Z = 1.58). Other recreational behaviors show limited sedentary hobbies and moderate social time and internet use; listening to music is relatively elevated (Z = 1.13). Regular sport participation and low substance involvement are typically associated with lower stress and better emotional regulation in this sample (sports correlate with lower PSS, r ≈ -0.13), suggesting lifestyle supports that would tend to reduce perceived stress.

Sleep behavior and circadian/physiological rhythms: Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 6 h 34 min (Z ≈ -0.77), with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 66 min; Z ≈ -0.79). Median sleep start time is around 00:59 with moderate variability (start-time SD Z ≈ 0.23). Subjective sleep quality by PSQI is at the conventional threshold (PSQI = 5; Z ≈ -0.80 classified as “Good Sleep” relative to the sample). Circadian features derived from heart rate indicate modestly reduced amplitude and slightly lower mesor (amplitude Z ≈ -0.39; mesor Z ≈ -0.33) but reasonable interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.16) and elevated 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ 0.48). Resting heart rate is comparatively low (54.6 bpm; Z ≈ -0.42). Overall, the wearable data portray a generally regular, structured daily rhythm with slightly shorter-than-average sleep duration but stable timing and low physiological arousal at rest—patterns that typically do not align with high perceived stress.

Physiological activity patterning and momentary arousal: Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (large negative deviations overnight, Z-scores often < 0) and expected daytime elevations, with the largest morning/daytime positive deviations occurring around 7–10 am (Z up to ~1.9 at 7–8 am for that hour’s deviation). Correlations between specific hourly deviations and PSS are generally small (most |r| < 0.2). The low resting heart rate and clear nocturnal dip indicate relatively low tonic physiological arousal, which is generally inconsistent with chronically elevated perceived stress.

Holistic integration and implications for perceived stress: Multiple convergent indicators point toward lower-to-average perceived stress in this participant. Low depressive symptoms, above-average self-esteem, regular vigorous physical activity, minimal substance use, generally good subjective sleep quality, a low resting heart rate, and a structured circadian profile collectively favor placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Countervailing signals are limited: trait anxiety is near the sample mean (and has a moderate correlation with PSS), overall happiness is somewhat below the mean, and absolute sleep duration is a bit short (~6.5 hours), which could modestly elevate perceived stress in some contexts. However, these factors do not outweigh the preponderance of indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress.

Conclusion (PSS group): Considering the balance of self-report, behavioral, and wearable physiological evidence, the participant most plausibly falls in the bottom half of the study population with respect to perceived stress.

71894,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate substantial affective symptom burden and psychological risk factors that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. The participant’s depressive symptom score on the CES-D is 34 (Z = 2.15), and trait anxiety on the STAI is 64 (Z = 2.24); both values are markedly above the study mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is low (Rosenberg score 19, Z = -2.7), and self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are below the sample average (happiness Z ≈ -1.61; health satisfaction Z ≈ -1.95). The PSQI is 6, which crosses the common threshold for disturbed sleep. Taken together, the self-report profile (elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, low self-esteem, reduced subjective wellbeing and health satisfaction) strongly favors a higher level of perceived stress.

Lifestyle and behavioral indicators provide mixed signals but do not contradict the pattern of elevated stress risk. The participant reports minimal substance use and engages in regular exercise alone (three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.07), which can be protective; however, they also report very high discretionary screen-based activity (internet usage >4 hours, Z ≈ 2.19) and prolonged listening to music (>4 hours, Z ≈ 2.06). Socializing time is above average (3–4 hours, Z ≈ 1.74) while reading and sedentary hobbies are low-to-moderate. Body mass index is in the overweight range (BMI = 28.27) and correlates indirectly with lower health satisfaction. The behavioral pattern suggests engagement in some healthful activity (regular exercise) but also elevated sedentary and screen time behaviors that often accompany and can exacerbate perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics are broadly consistent with elevated stress-related autonomic profile and some circadian irregularity. Resting heart rate and mean heart-rate mesor are above the sample mean (RHR = 63.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.65; MESOR = 80.9, Z ≈ 0.95). Circadian amplitude is reduced (amplitude Z ≈ -0.75), indicating blunted day–night heart rate variation, and intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (IV value 0.66, Z ≈ 0.81), consistent with greater within-day fragmentation; IV is positively associated with PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.16). Interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are not low (IS Z ≈ 0.5; autocorrelation Z ≈ 1.48), indicating a generally preserved 24-hour structure, but the lower amplitude combined with higher intraday variability suggests a physiologic profile that can reflect sustained sympathetic activation or less robust diurnal decline in arousal. Sleep metrics from the Fitbit show a median sleep duration near 6 hours 43 minutes (Z ≈ -0.58) and modest night-to-night variability; the objective sleep duration is slightly short and the PSQI indicates some subjective disturbance.

Holistic synthesis and PSS classification: the strongest and most consistent signals pointing toward elevated perceived stress come from the high and clinically elevated self-report affective scores (CES-D, STAI), very low self-esteem, reduced subjective wellbeing, and corroborating wearable features (elevated resting HR/mesor, reduced circadian amplitude, increased intradaily variability). Protective signs (regular solo exercise, preserved interday stability) are present but do not outweigh the magnitude of the affective symptom elevations and their known associations with higher perceived stress. On balance, the preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant’s PSS score is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution.

30453,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological self-report profile and implications for perceived stress:
The participant reports markedly elevated affective symptom burden and trait anxiety relative to the study sample. The CES-D score is 31 (Z = 1.84), indicating frequent depressive symptoms, and the STAI–Trait score is 51 (Z = 0.96), indicating above-average anxiety proneness; both of these scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31), supporting their relevance to perceived stress. Self-esteem and momentary affect are substantially lower than the cohort (RSES = 27, Z = -1.57; Current happiness Z = -1.61), and health satisfaction is also below average (Z ≈ -1.11). These self-report features constitute a cluster of internal states — elevated negative affect and anxiety combined with reduced self-regard and wellbeing — that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress in university populations.

Wearable-derived physiology, sleep, and circadian organization:
Objective physiology and sleep measures show patterns consistent with physiological arousal and circadian irregularity that would be expected to relate to higher perceived stress. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to peers (67.5 bpm, Z = 1.11), and the cosinor MESOR is above average (MESOR Z = 0.85), suggesting a modestly higher baseline cardiovascular level. Circadian stability is weakened (interdaily stability 0.30, Z = -0.9; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ -0.45) and intradaily variability is elevated (IV = 0.63, Z = 0.6), indicating less regular and more fragmented daily heart rate patterns. Amplitude of the rhythm is lower than average (Z = -0.63). Sleep is short on median (≈6 h 25 m, Z = -0.96), subjectively very disturbed (PSQI = 16, Z = 4.29), and shows high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = 1.0), with a late and variable sleep onset (median start ≈ 01:21, start time SD Z = 0.26). Several wearable features that reflect instability or fragmentation (higher IV, sleep variability, elevated resting HR) show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample, so these objective signals align with the self-report indicators of elevated perceived stress.

Behavioral habits and potential buffers:
Behavioral data present a mixed picture. The participant reports little to no substance use, frequent physical activity (sports and exercising with others reported three or more times per week; exercise-with-others Z = 1.23, sports Z = 1.58), and high engagement in solitary, potentially restorative activities (reading Z = 2.28, listening to music Z = 2.06). These behaviors are typically protective against stress and may mitigate some stress exposure or reactivity. However, socializing time is relatively low (negative Z), and reported health satisfaction and happiness are low, suggesting that protective activities may not fully offset internal distress. Some leisure habits (reading and music) show weak negative correlations with PSS in the sample, consistent with potential buffering, but the magnitude of the adverse physiological and affective signals appears larger.

Holistic assessment of likely perceived stress group:
Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of indicators supports a higher perceived stress profile. Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both moderately correlated with PSS), very poor subjective sleep quality (extremely high PSQI Z), elevated resting heart rate, and markers of circadian irregularity/fragmentation collectively point toward greater perceived stress relative to peers. Protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use, reading/music) are present but do not outweigh the multiple, concordant risk signals across self-report and wearable domains. Given the sample percentile information (median PSS ≈ 22) and the direction/magnitude of multiple stress-linked measures in this participant, the most consistent classification is that the participant’s perceived stress score falls in the higher half of the study distribution.

66047,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"The self-report profile indicates elevated internalizing symptomatology and low self-regard. The participant’s CES-D score is 46 (Z = 3.4) and the STAI–Trait score is 73 (Z = 3.13), both well above the study mean and consistent with a high burden of depressive and anxious symptoms. Concurrently, Rosenberg self-esteem is low (score = 21, Z = -2.42) and self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are substantially below the sample average (happiness Z = -1.61; health satisfaction Z = -2.28). Subjective sleep quality is also poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52), indicating notable sleep-related complaints. Together, these survey measures point to marked emotional distress, low subjective well-being, and impaired perceived health that commonly co-occur with elevated perceived stress.

Lifestyle and behavioral data emphasize sedentariness, extended screen time, and limited physical social/leisure engagement. The participant reports minimal exercise (exercise frequencies Z ≤ -1.18) and little participation in sports or group exercise; recreation is dominated by television and internet use (both >4 hours; TV Z = 3.17, internet Z = 2.19). Alcohol and recreational/non-prescribed drug use are minimal. Socializing with friends is modest (1–2 hours, near-sample-average). These patterns—high passive screen use, low physical activity, and limited active leisure—are behaviorally consistent with reduced stress-buffering activities and can exacerbate perceived stress and sleep disturbances.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics show a circadian rhythm with moderate fragmentation and some indicators of physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (68.4 bpm, Z = 1.22) and the mesor is somewhat higher than average (80.2, Z = 0.85), both of which can reflect higher baseline autonomic activation. Non-parametric circadian metrics show only modest interdaily stability (value 0.43, Z = 0.17) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (0.58, Z = 0.24), and the 24-hour autocorrelation is lower than average (Z = -0.28), suggesting less consistent daily structure. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is below average (Z = -0.31), and the acrophase (≈6:35 PM) indicates an evening timing of peak heart rate. Hourly aggregated deviations reveal relatively elevated heart rate around midnight–1am (12–1am deviation +5.8, Z = 1.09) followed by the expected nocturnal nadir across early morning hours. These features together suggest evening-late-night physiological activation and modest circadian irregularity rather than a strongly entrained, low-arousal pattern.

Sleep timing and nap behavior further reflect late schedules and greater compensatory daytime sleep. Median sleep duration is within the sample average (7 h 15 m, Z = 0.08), but median sleep onset is very late (≈02:41 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈84 min, Z ≈0.03). Daytime napping frequency is elevated (mean daily naps 0.28, Z = 2.4), consistent with a pattern of late sleep onset and daytime compensation. Subjective reports of disturbed sleep (PSQI elevated) despite average total duration suggest fragmented or non-restorative sleep, which would be expected to increase perceived stress and daytime distress.

Integrative interpretation and PSS ranking: multiple, converging indicators point toward elevated perceived stress. High scores on depressive and trait-anxiety measures (CES-D and STAI) and low self-esteem and health satisfaction are strong psychosocial predictors of higher perceived stress. Wearable data (elevated resting HR, signs of circadian irregularity and evening/night arousal) and behavioral markers (low exercise, high passive screen time, disturbed subjective sleep, increased naps) further support an interpretation of heightened physiological and behavioral stress burden. While there are some neutral or protective elements (minimal substance use, median total sleep time), the balance of psychological, behavioral, and physiological evidence favors placement in the upper half of the PSS distribution.

CES-D (score = 8, Z = -0.55) and STAI–Trait (score = 37, Z = -0.43) both fall below the sample mean and correlate positively with PSS only modestly (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), suggesting that current depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms are not prominent contributors to perceived stress for this individual. Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 37, Z = -0.17) and academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.8–4.0), both of which are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Subjective happiness is somewhat lower than average (current happiness = 3.0, Z = -0.53) but its correlation with PSS is small-to-moderate (r = -0.19), so this alone is a weak indicator of elevated perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Objective wearable data show relatively long and consistent nocturnal sleep (median duration 8 h 18 min, Z = 1.39) with few naps (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). The participant’s median sleep start time is late (~00:46), with moderate night-to-night timing variability (SD ≈ 52 minutes, Z = -0.68). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) crosses the typical threshold for disturbed sleep, although the PSQI Z is slightly below the sample mean (Z = -0.33). Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a low resting heart rate (52.9 bpm, Z = -0.62) and a modestly low MESOR (69.8, Z = -0.57) combined with a somewhat elevated amplitude (12.5, Z = 0.56) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈5:23 PM). Aggregated hourly HR deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions from mesor (~-20 bpm overnight) and robust daytime elevations (largest positive deviations in early evening), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and pronounced daytime activation. Taken together, the wearable physiology is consistent with good cardiovascular rest overnight and preserved day–night rhythm, which would typically be associated with lower perceived stress rather than chronically elevated physiological arousal.

Behavior, lifestyle, and circadian regularity: The participant reports minimal regular exercise and little participation in organized sports (exercise with others and sports largely “not at all”), and social activity is modest (socializing 1–2 hours daily). Alcohol use shows a notable pattern: wine or liquor reported “three times a week or more” (Z = 1.68), while beer and other recreational drug use are absent. Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms is slightly below average (value = 0.37, Z = -0.33) but intradaily variability is relatively low (value = 0.41, Z = -0.95), and 24-h autocorrelation is moderately positive (Z = 0.64), suggesting generally consistent within-day structure and some day-to-day fluctuation. The combination of low exercise and relatively frequent alcohol consumption could represent behavioral coping strategies for stress in some individuals, but correlations between these behavioral items and PSS are small in this sample, so their contribution to perceived stress is uncertain.

Integration relevant to perceived stress (PSS): Multiple objective and self-report indicators point toward a lower-or-average level of perceived stress for this participant. Low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem, strong academic performance, low resting heart rate, extended and consolidated objective sleep, and preserved circadian amplitude and daytime activation orient toward lower perceived stress. The most notable counter-indicators are a PSQI score just above the common threshold for sleep disturbance and relatively frequent wine/liquor consumption; both can be associated with higher stress in some contexts but their sample correlations with PSS here are small and other markers do not show concordant elevations. Where correlations with PSS are available, the strongest symptom measures that typically predict higher PSS (CES-D, STAI) are low for this participant. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors a PSS level in the lower-to-median portion of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

33133,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"The self-report profile indicates notable affective symptom burden and sleep complaints that are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. The participant scored high on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 31; Z = 1.84, classification “Depressed”) and showed elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76). Subjective sleep quality was poor (PSQI = 11; Z = 1.98, “Disturbed Sleep”), and self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (Z = -0.53). Self-esteem is near the cohort mean (RSES = 37; Z = -0.17), but the combination of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms together with marked sleep disturbance constitutes strong self-report evidence pointing toward higher perceived stress. The provided correlations show positive relationships of CES-D and STAI with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), which supports the relevance of these elevated symptom scores to PSS.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures provide convergent behavioral evidence. Median nightly sleep duration was about 6 hours 38 minutes (Z = -0.68), below the cohort average and in a range associated with increased stress vulnerability. Sleep start times are late (median ~00:40) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = 0.39). Although sleep duration variability is lower than average (duration SD Z = -0.85), the combination of truncated sleep quantity, late timing, and subjective poor sleep quality suggests restorative sleep is compromised — a pattern frequently linked to higher perceived stress and to the participant’s elevated PSQI score.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced circadian amplitude and some within-day fragmentation that are consistent with physiological correlates of stress. Cosinor-derived amplitude is somewhat lower than the sample mean (Amplitude Z = -0.22) and interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z = -0.08), while intradaily variability (IV = 0.63; Z = 0.6) is elevated, suggesting greater fragmentation of activity/physiological state across the day. Resting heart rate is close to the mean (58.6 bpm; Z = 0.05), but the aggregated hourly deviation profile shows a pronounced morning rise (8–9am deviation +16 bpm; Z = 2.09) and sustained elevations in late afternoon/evening hours. This pattern—heightened daytime/early-morning arousal combined with greater intraday variability—aligns with physiological patterns often observed in individuals reporting higher stress.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are mixed but offer modest support for elevated stress. The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three times per week; Z = 1.07), limited recreational drug use, moderate socializing (~1–2 hours; Z ≈ 0.16), and reasonable health satisfaction (Z = 0.8), which could buffer stress. However, frequent internet use (3–4 hours; Z = 1.52), modest alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 0.94–1.01), and low engagement in some restorative recreational activities (e.g., little reading, low TV time) may reflect coping patterns that do not fully mitigate stress. Taken together, behavioral evidence does not strongly contradict the signal from affective and physiological measures and instead suggests partial behavioral compensation amid ongoing distress.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: self-report affective symptom burden (notably elevated CES-D and STAI), marked subjective sleep disturbance, shortened sleep duration, elevated intradaily variability and a pronounced morning heart rate surge—all of which have modest positive correlations with PSS—support the interpretation that this participant’s perceived stress is above the cohort median. Some protective features (regular exercise, moderate social contact, and reasonable health satisfaction) temper but do not outweigh the converging signals for elevated stress. On balance, the available data are most consistent with placement in the upper half of the study population on perceived stress.

47810,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report data portray a mixed psychological profile. Scores on standard mood and trait measures are generally within the non-clinical range: CES-D is modestly elevated but near the study mean (15, Z = 0.18) and STAI–Trait is below average (37, Z = -0.43). Self‑esteem is high (39/40, Z = 0.11). Subjective well-being and health satisfaction are somewhat lower than peers (current happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.7), suggesting some day-to-day dissatisfaction despite otherwise intact trait-level functioning. The participant reports limited sedentary recreational media and minimal substance or drug use; exercise occurs at low-to-moderate frequency (typically 1–2 times per week). Together these self-reports indicate relatively preserved affective and personality functioning with pockets of lower subjective well-being and sleep-related complaints.

Sleep self-report and wearable-derived sleep metrics converge on notable sleep disturbance and irregular timing. The PSQI is elevated (score = 9, Z = 1.05), indicating clinically relevant subjective sleep problems. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is on the short side (6 h 40 m, Z = -0.65) and the median sleep start time is late (around 01:26), with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 65 minutes). Mean daily naps are relatively frequent (0.27 naps/day, Z = 2.34), consistent with compensation for nocturnal sleep insufficiency. These features—short, late, and fragmented sleep with daytime napping—are commonly associated with poorer perceived sleep quality and can contribute to elevated perceived stress.

Wearable circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate reduced circadian regularity and elevated within-day fragmentation. Interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.40, Z = -0.08) and 24-hour autocorrelation is low (0.21, Z = -0.95), while intradaily variability is substantially elevated (0.83, Z = 2.01), a pattern consistent with irregular activity/rest cycles and frequent transitions between states across the day. The mesor and resting heart rate are near the sample mean (mesor 75.2 bpm, Z = 0.17; resting HR 56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show deep nocturnal troughs and pronounced late-afternoon/evening elevations (largest positive deviations in late afternoon and early evening, several hours with Z > 0.9), reflecting higher physiological activation in the evening and clear sleep-period downregulation overnight. Elevated intradaily variability and irregular circadian markers commonly relate to subjective stress and difficulties with sleep–wake organization.

Evidence for lower or average perceived stress (bottom half) includes: relatively low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -0.43), absence of marked depressive symptoms (CES-D near average), strong self‑esteem, and limited use of alcohol/other recreational substances. These features would tend to protect against high perceived stress. Evidence for elevated perceived stress (top half) includes marked subjective sleep problems (PSQI Z = 1.05), short and late nocturnal sleep with elevated napping (napping Z = 2.34), and pronounced intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour rhythmic stability (intradaily variability Z = 2.01; autocorrelation Z = -0.95)—physiological and behavioral signatures that often accompany or exacerbate higher perceived stress. Modest reductions in reported happiness and health satisfaction further bias toward greater perceived stress.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: trait-level affective measures (low trait anxiety, normal depressive symptoms, high self‑esteem) provide some protective signal, but the combination of clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, objectively irregular circadian patterns (high intradaily variability, low 24h autocorrelation), frequent daytime napping, and lower momentary happiness/health satisfaction are consistent with elevated perceived stress. Given the relatively large effect sizes in sleep and circadian disruption (Z-scores > 1 and > 2 for PSQI, intradaily variability and naps) and their established links to perceived stress, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant’s PSS score is more likely to fall in the top half of the study distribution.

Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (RSES Z = 1.10; Current Happiness Z = 1.64) and satisfaction with physical health is higher than average (Health Satisfaction Z = 1.38). Sleep quality by self-report is in the “good” range (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26). Academic performance is high (GPAs near the top of the scale), and substance use is limited to moderate, infrequent alcohol consumption with no recreational/non-prescribed drug use reported. Together, these self-report domains form a coherent signal consistent with lower perceived stress and greater psychological and behavioral resources.

Behavioral and wearable-derived activity metrics provide a more mixed picture with small signals that could modestly temper the low-stress profile indicated by self-report. Objective sleep duration is modestly below the study mean (median 6 h 33 min, Z = -0.79), and the median sleep start time is late (about 01:02 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ~72 minutes). Time spent napping is low but not absent (mean daily naps 0.15, Z = 0.94). Cardiovascular circadian summaries show a relatively low mesor (66.6, Z = -1.01) and reduced amplitude (8.84, Z = -0.63), indicating lower overall heart rate levels and a compressed 24-hour range compared with the sample. Interdaily stability is below average (0.34, Z = -0.57) while intradaily variability is elevated (0.66, Z = 0.81), a pattern that denotes less consistent day-to-day timing of physiological rhythms and greater within-day fragmentation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and mid-afternoon peaks (acrophase ~3:36 PM), but the overall circadian signal (autocorrelation at 24h) is weaker than average (Z = -0.87). These wearable indicators suggest a physiologically lower-arousal baseline and some irregularity in daily structure; in this dataset such circadian irregularity has small positive correlations with perceived stress but the effect sizes are modest.

Integrating multimodal signals for perceived stress: the preponderance of evidence favors a relatively low perceived stress level. Multiple self-report indices directly tied to stress liability—trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep quality, self-esteem, and happiness—are consistently on the favorable side of the sample distribution, and behaviors that commonly buffer stress (regular exercise three times per week, limited substance use, good academic functioning) are present. Wearable-derived markers introduce nuance: lower mesor and resting heart rate align with lower physiological arousal, but reduced interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability point to a less regular daily schedule, which can be associated with higher stress in some contexts. Correlations between the wearable circadian metrics and PSS are small in magnitude. On balance, given the strong, concordant self-report evidence and only modest, mixed wearable signals, the overall pattern is most consistent with perceived stress that is in the lower half of the study distribution.

62246,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant’s self-report measures indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and protective psychosocial resources. Depressive symptom endorsement on the CES-D is low (score = 4; Z = -0.97), and trait anxiety is also below the sample mean (STAI = 33; Z = -0.82). Self-esteem is comparatively elevated (Rosenberg RSES Z = 0.96), and subjective health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.63). Sleep quality by PSQI is good (score = 3; Z = -1.72). Measures that tend to track positively with perceived stress in this sample (CES-D and STAI) are low here, while protective factors (self-esteem, health satisfaction, subjective sleep) are in the direction associated with lower perceived stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and daily-rest patterns: Objective sleep metrics from the Fitbit show a median nightly sleep duration of about 7 hours 39 minutes (Z = 0.59) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD 65 minutes; Z = -0.82) and infrequent napping (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). Sleep start time is near midnight (median ~23:56) with modest variability (SD 78 minutes; Z = -0.11). These features (adequate duration, low variability, consistent start times, minimal napping) are typically associated with better restorative sleep and, in this sample, tend to correlate with lower perceived stress.

Circadian and cardiac physiology: Circadian rhythm measures derived from heart rate indicate a reasonably regular rhythm and clear day–night contrast. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.44; Z = 0.25), intradaily variability is low (0.32; Z = -1.59), and 24-hour autocorrelation is modest (0.33; Z = 0.06). MESOR (78.05 bpm; Z = 0.56) and amplitude (12.24; Z = 0.47) are modestly elevated relative to peers, but resting heart rate is low (57 bpm; Z = -0.14). The hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations around 3–6 AM) and daytime elevations peaking in the early–mid afternoon, consistent with a healthy circadian profile. Low intradaily variability and preserved interdaily stability suggest stable daily structure in arousal—features that, in this dataset, generally relate to lower perceived stress.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle: The participant reports regular physical activity (exercised alone three times per week or more; Z = 1.07) and occasional social exercise and sports. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week) and non-prescribed or recreational drug use is absent. Daily leisure shows limited passive media use (little TV/music/reading) and modest social interaction (1–2 hours). These behavioral patterns—regular exercise, limited substance use, and reasonable social engagement—are commonly associated with better stress coping and lower perceived stress in student samples.

Integrative assessment of perceived stress (PSS grouping): Across modalities, the participant shows a consistent profile of low symptom burden (low CES-D and STAI), strong psychosocial resources (higher self-esteem, good health satisfaction), good objective and subjective sleep, regular circadian structure (low intradaily variability, reasonable interdaily stability), low resting heart rate, and health-promoting behaviors (regular exercise, minimal drug use). Many of these indicators have established, and sample-specific, negative associations with PSS; conversely, variables that typically predict higher PSS are not strongly present. Taken holistically, the preponderance of evidence points to perceived stress levels at or below the population median rather than elevated. Therefore the participant is most consistent with the bottom half of the sample distribution on the PSS.

55424,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures indicate a profile aligned with elevated perceived stress. The participant reports high depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 35, Z = 2.26) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 57, Z = 1.55); both scales show positive correlations with PSS within the sample (r ≈ 0.28 and r ≈ 0.31 respectively), so these large deviations from the mean provide strong evidence that the participant experiences greater stress-related affective load than peers. Positive affect and self-worth are lower than average (Rosenberg self-esteem z ≈ -0.87; current happiness z ≈ -1.61), patterns that typically co-occur with higher perceived stress. Behavioral health indices from surveys (minimal recreational drug use, modest alcohol use, frequent group exercise) are not strongly suggestive of elevated PSS and may partially buffer stress, but their correlations with PSS are small and do not offset the substantial mood- and sleep-related symptom elevations.

Objective physiological and circadian metrics present a mixed but not contradictory picture. Heart-rate–based circadian measures reflect a generally regular rhythm (interdaily stability near sample mean, autocorrelation at 24 h slightly above mean, intradaily variability below mean), and a moderate amplitude and afternoon acrophase (approx. 3:36 PM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.6 bpm, z ≈ -0.07), which often indicates good cardiovascular fitness and a lower basal physiological arousal. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected large nocturnal decreases and afternoon/evening elevations in mean heart rate; afternoon/evening peaks are relatively pronounced (large positive deviations and positive z-scores), consistent with daily activity timing rather than sustained physiological hyperarousal across the 24‑hour cycle. The circadian metrics that typically associate with lower PSS (e.g., greater stability and lower fragmentation) are at or slightly better than average for this participant, suggesting preserved circadian organization despite high subjective distress.

Sleep data show a notable objective–subjective discrepancy that is relevant to perceived stress. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is in the adequate range (7 h 24 min, z ≈ 0.27) and night-to-night variability is somewhat lower than average (SD 69 min, z ≈ -0.72). However, the participant reports markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 14, z ≈ 3.37), a very large deviation that correlates with stress in prior analyses. Frequent daytime napping (mean daily naps ≈ 0.24, z ≈ 1.9) further indicates daytime sleepiness or compensatory behavior. This pattern—objectively sufficient sleep duration but substantially disturbed subjective sleep—commonly accompanies and amplifies perceived stress and mood symptoms, and the very high PSQI score is a strong indicator in favor of elevated perceived stress.

Holistic integration: weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward elevated perceived stress. The subjective affective measures (depression, anxiety, low happiness, low self‑esteem) are strongly elevated relative to the study sample and positively correlated with PSS; subjective sleep disturbance is also extreme and commonly tracks with higher PSS. Objective wearable metrics (adequate sleep duration, preserved circadian stability, low resting HR, frequent group exercise, low substance use) provide some indications of physiological resilience that could mitigate stress but their correlations with PSS are modest and do not outweigh the large subjective symptom deviations. On balance, the pattern of very high depressive and anxiety symptoms plus severe self-reported sleep disturbance supports classifying this participant’s perceived stress within the upper half of the study distribution.

23576,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 7, z = -0.66; STAI-Trait = 34, z = -0.72), together with above-average self-esteem (Rosenberg z ≈ 0.96) and high academic performance (GPA consistently near 4.0). Substance use is absent across surveyed categories and the participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more). Subjective happiness is somewhat below the study average (current happiness z ≈ -0.53), but overall health satisfaction is above average (z ≈ 0.72). These self-report indicators collectively point to relatively low burdens of internalizing symptoms and stable, health-oriented daily habits—factors that are typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep quality: Objective Fitbit-derived sleep measures indicate a median nightly sleep duration near 7 hours 46 minutes (z ≈ 0.72) with low night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 58 minutes, z ≈ -0.98) and few naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, z ≈ -0.86). The median sleep onset is around 00:38 with relatively consistent start times (SD ≈ 45 minutes, z ≈ -0.83). Subjectively, the PSQI score is 6, which crosses the commonly used threshold for disturbed sleep, suggesting the participant perceives some sleep-related difficulties despite objectively sufficient and regular sleep duration. This pattern (adequate objective duration and low variability but a borderline elevated PSQI) can reflect perceived sleep quality or minor sleep complaints that may modestly influence perceived stress but do not indicate major sleep irregularity.

Circadian and cardiovascular rhythm features: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show moderate regularity and a well-defined daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is moderately positive (0.47, z ≈ 0.5) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (0.45, z ≈ 1.06), indicating consistent day-to-day structure in cardiovascular activity. Intradaily variability is modest (0.58, z ≈ 0.24), reflecting only mild fragmentation of hourly activity rhythms. The cosinor-derived MESOR is slightly below average (71.37 bpm, z ≈ -0.35) and amplitude is near the cohort mean (10.47, z ≈ -0.1). Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.6 bpm, z ≈ -0.07), consistent with reported regular exercise and likely reflecting good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregate deviations show robust nocturnal decreases (largest negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevations with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:05 PM); these hourly patterns are typical of a consolidated nocturnal sleep period and active daytime physiology.

Links to perceived stress (PSS) and integrative interpretation: Across modalities, indicators that typically covary with perceived stress are mostly in directions consistent with lower stress. Low depressive and anxiety symptom scores and high self-esteem are associated with reduced perceived stress (CES-D and STAI correlations with PSS are positive but the participant’s scores are low). Regular exercise, absence of substance use, stable sleep timing, low sleep variability, and a pronounced 24-hour autocorrelation all align with behavioral stability that tends to accompany lower PSS scores (several of these features have small but directionally consistent correlations with PSS in the cohort). The elevated PSQI (6) and slightly lower self-reported happiness represent modest countervailing signals that could push perceived stress upward, but their magnitude relative to the broader pattern is small. Wearable-derived correlations with PSS are generally weak in magnitude; notable signals (e.g., modest negative correlation between interdaily stability and PSS, modest positive correlation between some measures of nocturnal heart rate deviation and PSS) are consistent with the overall profile of a participant who experiences organized daily structure and comparatively lower physiological arousal at rest.

Overall PSS-group classification: Synthesizing self-report, sleep, activity, and circadian physiology, the preponderance of evidence (low depressive/anxiety symptomatology, high self-esteem, high academic functioning, regular exercise, consistent objective sleep, low resting heart rate, and reasonably stable circadian metrics) indicates that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study population on perceived stress. Although there are small signals (borderline PSQI, slightly reduced happiness) that could raise perceived stress modestly, they are outweighed by multiple concordant indicators of lower stress. Therefore the participant is most consistent with the bottom 50% of the PSS distribution.

93485,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report psychological measures indicate a profile that, on balance, aligns with lower perceived stress. The participant reports low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 6; z = -0.76) and relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 35; z = -0.62); both of these scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so low scores here argue for relatively lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is elevated (RSES z = 0.82), and self-esteem is modestly negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), which further supports lower stress. Current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (z ≈ -0.53), a small signal in the opposite direction (happiness r ≈ -0.19 with PSS), but its magnitude is limited relative to the stronger low-anxiety and low-depression signals.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators are largely consistent with adaptive routines that tend to associate with lower perceived stress. The participant reports regular solo exercise (three times/week or more; z ≈ 1.07) and high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction z ≈ 1.8), both of which are generally protective or indicative of better stress-related outcomes (health satisfaction has a small negative correlation with PSS). Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; both z ≈ 1.0), but these usage metrics have negligible correlations with PSS in the sample and do not strongly suggest higher perceived stress. Social and recreational activities show limited engagement in sedentary hobbies and team sports, but time spent socializing and on internet/music is near sample averages and not strongly associated with PSS here.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology point toward a relatively well-structured sleep–wake rhythm and fitness-related physiology, consistent with lower perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours (7:01; z ≈ -0.2) with modest night-to-night variability; subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; z ≈ -0.8) is in the “good” range. Circadian regularity metrics are elevated: interdaily stability (z ≈ 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (z ≈ 1.23) indicate consistent day-to-day heart-rate rhythms, and cosinor-derived amplitude is high (z ≈ 1.9). In this sample, greater stability and amplitude are modestly associated with lower PSS (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; amplitude r ≈ -0.16). Resting heart rate is low (47.3 bpm; z ≈ -1.29), suggesting higher cardiovascular fitness, a physiological characteristic weakly positively correlated with lower perceived stress in the study (note resting HR correlation with PSS is small positive in the dataset, r ≈ 0.14, but the low resting HR here is typically an indicator of fitness rather than stress). Hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough and daytime elevation (peak mid-afternoon), a canonical diurnal profile consistent with robust circadian organization and not indicative of chronic hyperarousal.

A synthesis of the multimodal evidence favors relatively lower perceived stress. Key contributors to this inference are low depressive and trait anxiety scores (both positively related to PSS when higher), elevated self-esteem, objectively regular and high-amplitude circadian rhythms from the wearable, generally adequate sleep duration and quality, and a low resting heart rate consistent with fitness. Countervailing signals are small in magnitude: a modestly elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.46) that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), a moderate frequency of alcohol use (z ≈ 1.0) with negligible PSS association, and slightly lower self-rated happiness; these do not outweigh the larger, consistent indicators pointing toward lower perceived stress. Taken holistically, the pattern of psychological self-report, behavioral habits, and physiological regularity is most consistent with a perceived stress level in the lower half of the study distribution.

62617,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"Self-report measures indicate a profile consistent with relatively low perceived distress during the recording period. Scores on depressive (CES-D = 1.0, z = -1.28) and trait-anxiety (STAI = 28, z = -1.31) scales are well below the study mean, and current happiness and self-esteem indicators are above the sample average (Happy z = 1.64; SelfEsteem z = 1.24). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, z = -0.8) is at or just below the conventional clinical threshold for disturbance and the participant reports substantive exercise frequency (exercised alone three times/week or more, z = 1.07). Substance use is minimal (no recreational/non-prescribed drug use; modest alcohol use). These self-report patterns—low depression and anxiety scores together with elevated happiness and self-regard and regular exercise—are collectively most consistent with lower perceived stress than the study mean.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics present a mixed but not strongly contradictory picture. Resting heart rate (60.6 bpm, z = 0.29) and mesor (78.2, z = 0.58) are slightly above the study mean but within typical ranges for young adults. Amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is relatively low (z = -1.01), and interdaily stability is notably reduced (z = -1.73), indicating smaller day–night heart-rate differences and less regularity in the timing of that rhythm across days. Those particular features (lower amplitude and lower interdaily stability) are modestly associated with higher PSS scores in the population-level correlations (amplitude r ≈ -0.17; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.13), suggesting that circadian blunting and irregularity could be small contributors to perceived stress. However, the magnitude of those associations is small, and the participant’s high autocorrelation at 24 hours (z ≈ 0.98) indicates a preserved 24‑hour structure despite day-to-day timing variability.

Hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations ~ -12 to -13 bpm in the 3–6 AM window) and evening peaks (notable positive deviations in late afternoon/evening, e.g., 7–10 PM). Correlations between these hourly deviations and PSS are weak and inconsistent in direction, implying little evidence that time-of-day heart-rate elevations are strongly driving perceived stress for this individual. Overall cardiovascular signals do not show a pattern of sustained daytime hyperarousal that would clearly point to elevated perceived stress.

Sleep quantity and regularity on the wearable are favorable and align with the low self-reported distress. Median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 25 min, z = 1.53), sleep onset is near midnight (median start ~23:56), and nap frequency is negligible. Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is modest but not extreme (sleep start SD ~70 minutes; duration SD ~78 minutes). The long median sleep duration and absence of frequent napping or severe fragmentation are generally consistent with lower perceived stress, and population correlations for these sleep metrics with PSS are minimal in this dataset.

Holistic integration: weighing self-report trait and state measures heavily (they are the closest indicators of perceived stress) together with wearable signals (which show some circadian irregularity but weak links to PSS), the balance of evidence supports a PSS placement in the lower half of the sample. Self-report indices that most strongly relate to perceived stress—trait anxiety and depressive symptoms—are markedly low for this participant, and subjective well-being measures are relatively high; the wearable-derived features that might point to higher stress (reduced amplitude, reduced interdaily stability) are small-to-moderate effects and do not appear to override the consistent pattern of low self-reported distress. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom 50% of PSS scores in this population.

42137,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Self-report profile and psychological symptom indicators:
The participant’s self-report measures present a mixed picture with modest elevation on measures that typically relate to perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42; Z ≈ 0.07) and depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 15; Z ≈ 0.18) are slightly above the study mean but close to population average, and both correlate positively with PSS in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28). Subjective sleep quality is worse than average (PSQI = 8; Z ≈ 0.59; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), a feature often linked to higher perceived stress. Current self-rated happiness is lower than average (score = 3.0; Z ≈ -0.53), while self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 37; Z ≈ -0.17) and trust in others is elevated (Z ≈ 0.83). Behavioral health habits outside of sleep are generally health-supporting: low alcohol and drug use, regular solo exercise (3+ times/week; Z ≈ 1.07), and stable academic performance (GPAs in the low-mid 3s). Taken together, the self-report data point to modest but non-clinical elevations in anxiety/depressive symptoms and poorer subjective sleep, which are components that commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular measures:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a pattern of relatively low overall cardiac setpoint and reduced daily amplitude alongside modestly elevated within-day fragmentation. Mesor and amplitude are both below the population mean (Mesor = 62.6 bpm, Z ≈ -1.55; Amplitude = 8.56, Z ≈ -0.72), indicating lower average heart rate and a blunted daily rhythm in heart-rate variability from trough to peak. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.33) while intradaily variability is elevated (Z ≈ 0.6), suggesting a reasonably stable day-to-day timing but more fragmented activity or physiological arousal within days. Resting heart rate is comparatively low (50.3 bpm; Z ≈ -0.93), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness; its small positive correlation (r ≈ 0.14) with PSS in the sample is modest and should be interpreted cautiously. Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced daytime peaks (notably mid-morning and late-afternoon) and expected nocturnal troughs; these peak times align with scheduled activity windows rather than clear markers of chronic hyperarousal. Overall, the wearable physiological profile signals adequate cardiovascular fitness and a dampened circadian amplitude with some intraday instability—features that can accompany increased perceived stress but are not strongly diagnostic on their own.

Sleep behavior and subjective-objective concordance:
Objective sleep duration is in the normative range (median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 18 min; Z ≈ 0.14) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 90 minutes), and median sleep onset around 00:31. Despite adequate objective duration, the participant reports poorer subjective sleep (PSQI elevated), indicating a mismatch between quantity and perceived quality. Sleep variability measures (start time SD and duration SD) are not extreme but show modest associations with PSS (correlations ≈ 0.14–0.17). The combination of sufficient sleep duration, later average sleep onset, and subjective sleep disturbance suggests sleep-related complaints that could contribute to or reflect higher perceived stress, even in the absence of gross objective sleep deprivation.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Synthesizing modalities, the strongest evidence pointing toward elevated perceived stress is the cluster of modestly higher trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, poorer subjective sleep quality, and increased intradaily physiological variability—each of which has a documented relationship with perceived stress and shows modest positive correlations with PSS in this sample. Offsetting factors include protective behavioral indices (regular exercise, low substance use), good academic performance, relatively high self-esteem and trust, and a low resting heart rate, which reduce the likelihood of very high perceived stress. Because several stress-related indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, lower happiness, and symptom measures) are above the population median while objective health behaviors and fitness are favorable, the overall profile is most consistent with a mild-to-moderate elevation in perceived stress relative to peers rather than a low-stress profile. On balance, the multimodal evidence modestly favors the participant being in the higher half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

Conclusion (group classification):
Based on the combined self-report and wearable-derived evidence—particularly the modest elevations in anxiety and depressive symptoms, the elevated PSQI, and increased intradaily variability—I classify the participant’s perceived stress as more likely to fall in the top half of the study population distribution.

These self-report measures that have the largest positive correlations with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES‑D r ≈ 0.28) indicate a psychological profile that is commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Conversely, protective indicators such as self‑esteem and happiness show negative correlations with PSS and are relatively low for this participant, which would be expected to accompany higher perceived stress rather than to buffer it.

Sleep behavior and circadian physiology: Subjective and wearable sleep data indicate relatively short and irregular sleep. Median nighttime sleep duration is just under seven hours (6 h 56 min, Z = -0.31) with high night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD = 151 min, Z = 1.13) and a late median sleep onset (≈01:04). PSQI score of 7 (Z = 0.13) meets the threshold commonly used to indicate disturbed sleep. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate point to reduced 24‑hour regularity (interdaily stability = 0.23, Z = -1.48; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = -1.54) and a reduced amplitude (Z = -1.08). Hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions and a large morning rise (6–7 AM deviation Z = 3.5), consistent with a consolidated nocturnal rest period but with notable variability in timing. Several sleep and circadian features (sleep variability, low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude) have small-to-moderate correlations with PSS in this dataset and, taken together, align more with profiles that report greater perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; Zs >1), limited recreational drug use, moderate alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94), and relatively high time spent listening to music and online. Socializing is present but moderate (1–2 hours/day). Regular exercise is a potential resilience factor, but its correlation with PSS in this sample is weak. Other behaviors that typically influence stress—substance use and social contact—are either moderate or infrequent and do not provide strong counterevidence to the indicators of elevated stress seen in the psychological and sleep/circadian data.

Evidence weighing for PSS group assignment: Evidence consistent with a lower or median PSS (bottom 50%) is limited. Protective signs include frequent exercise and absence of heavy drug use, and resting heart rate is average to slightly higher than cohort mean (59.3 bpm, Z = 0.14), which does not strongly indicate high stress. Evidence consistent with a higher PSS (top 50%) is stronger: elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (the two self‑report features with the largest positive correlations to PSS in this cohort), low self‑esteem and happiness, disturbed and irregular sleep timing, and circadian irregularity each point toward greater perceived stress. Multiple independent domains (affective traits, sleep disturbance, circadian instability) align in the direction associated with higher PSS, and several of those measures show nontrivial correlations with PSS in this sample.

Holistic conclusion: Balancing the domains, the preponderance of evidence (notably high trait anxiety, elevated depressive symptoms, low self‑esteem/happiness, disturbed and irregular sleep, and reduced circadian stability) is more consistent with a participant whose perceived stress falls in the upper half of the study distribution.

CES-D depressive symptom score is at the floor (0; Z = -1.38) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) is at the minimum of the scale (20; Z = -2.11), both of which are robust indicators of low reported negative affect and anxious disposition across the sampling period. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are relatively high (SelfEsteem Z = 1.1; Happy Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction is near the cohort average. Taken together, these self-report measures form a consistent picture of low symptomatology and favorable self-appraisal—features that, based on the provided correlations (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.30; SelfEsteem r ≈ -0.15), are associated with lower perceived stress in this sample.

Behavioral lifestyle and social features: The participant reports very low substance use and minimal participation in organized sports or group exercise. Leisure patterns are strongly oriented toward sedentary, screen-based activities (TV, video games, internet, music, and other sedentary hobbies all reported >4 hours with large positive Z-scores). Socializing time is also elevated (>4 hours, Z ≈ 2.53). These behaviors present a mixed behavioral risk profile: high sedentary recreation and little exercise are potential stress-related risk factors, but high reported social time and low substance use are protective. Correlational links between these specific habits and PSS in the dataset are small (many correlations near zero or weak), so their net contribution to perceived stress is likely limited relative to the stronger psychological indicators noted above.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate physiology: Objective circadian metrics demonstrate a well-entrained and regular cardiac rhythm. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are high (Z ≈ 2.4 and 2.24 respectively) and intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -2.29), indicating consistent day-to-day patterns and low fragmentation of activity/physiology across days—features typically associated with better regulation and lower stress. Cosinor parameters show a higher-than-average mesor and amplitude (Mesor Z = 1.35; Amplitude Z = 1.72) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:51 PM). Resting heart rate is modestly above the cohort mean (62.4 bpm; Z = 0.51), but hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected pronounced nocturnal decline and daytime elevations. Correlations between these circadian metrics and PSS are generally small (e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ -0.10; amplitude r ≈ -0.15; resting HR r ≈ 0.14), but the strong regularity and low fragmentation provide objective evidence consistent with lower perceived stress.

Sleep quantity and timing: Sleep recordings indicate normative duration and good consistency: median nightly sleep = 7 h 14 min (Z ≈ 0.06) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z ≈ -1.48) and few naps. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 3; Z ≈ -1.72) is rated as good. The primary deviation from a purely prototypical profile is a late median sleep onset time (~01:04 AM), though sleep onset variability is moderate and overall sleep stability is high. Across the dataset, better subjective and objective sleep metrics are associated with lower PSS, so the participant’s sleep profile supports lower perceived stress.

Synthesis and inference about perceived stress: Multiple independent domains converge on an inference of relatively low perceived stress. Low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, elevated happiness and self-esteem, objectively regular circadian rhythms, and good/consistent sleep together form a coherent pattern that has established associations with lower PSS in this cohort. Some behavioral features (high sedentary leisure, low exercise) could be risk factors for increased stress over longer periods, but their correlations with PSS here are weak and are outweighed by the stronger protective signals from psychological well-being and physiological regularity. Trust is notably low (Z ≈ -2.39), a potential social vulnerability, but its direct association with PSS is small in the provided correlations.

Overall classification: Considering the balance of evidence—particularly the very low CES-D and STAI scores, high happiness and self-esteem, regular circadian physiology, and good sleep—the participant is most consistent with the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

69057,26.0,0.927461139896373,"Multimodal psychological-behavioral summary:
The participant presents a mixed profile in which several psychological and behavioral indicators align with elevated perceived stress while others suggest partial physiological or behavioral resilience. Trait anxiety is notably elevated (STAI = 53, z = +1.16), and this measure shows one of the stronger positive correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale in the sample (r ≈ 0.31). Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are low-to-moderate (score = 12, z = -0.14) and therefore do not strongly indicate concurrent high mood-related burden. Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES = 35, z = -0.45), a small negative correlate of perceived stress (r ≈ -0.15). Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7), which is consistent with other behavioral findings and is relevant because sleep complaints commonly accompany higher stress.

Sleep and circadian patterns (wearable + self-report):
Objective sleep from the wearable shows very short typical nightly sleep (median = 5 h 35 min, z ≈ -1.99) and a markedly delayed median sleep onset (≈ 02:08). Sleep timing is relatively consistent (start-time SD ≈ 53 min, z ≈ -0.66) but the short duration is a prominent feature. The participant’s sleep fragmentation/variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 122 minutes, z ≈ +0.49) and PSQI-based disturbance together suggest that sleep quantity and quality could be a contributing factor to perceived strain. Circadian summary metrics indicate reduced interdaily stability (0.32, z ≈ -0.74) and elevated intradaily variability (0.60, z ≈ +0.39), consistent with less robust or more fragmented day-to-day rest–activity or autonomic rhythms. These circadian irregularities have modest positive associations with PSS in the sample (intradaily variability r ≈ +0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11), suggesting they may be relevant to stress perception for this participant.

Cardiovascular physiology and daily patterning:
Cardiac measures reflect a generally low average heart-rate baseline (resting HR = 43.6 bpm, z ≈ -1.73; mesor = 57.9, z ≈ -2.19), which likely indicates high cardiovascular fitness or vagal tone rather than hyperarousal. Resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ +0.15), but the participant’s low resting rate may act as a physiological buffer. Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show a pronounced daytime/evening elevation (largest positive deviation 5–6 pm = +22.8 bpm, z ≈ +1.79) and strong nocturnal troughs in the early morning. The pattern is typical of a delayed-sleep schedule with increased evening cardiovascular activation and deep overnight lowering; these hourly deviations themselves have small and generally inconsistent correlations with PSS.

Behavioral and social context:
Behavioral habits include regular exercise (exercised alone three+ times per week, z ≈ +1.07), moderate socializing (1–2 hours, z ≈ +0.16), and limited substance use (beer/wine 1–2×/month). Frequent exercise is a protective factor that is often associated with lower perceived stress and better autonomic profiles; its presence here is a notable mitigating factor. Self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are slightly below average (happiness z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction z ≈ -0.78), but not at extreme levels. The combination of social activity, routine exercise, and low depressive symptoms points toward behavioral resilience despite sleep restriction and elevated trait anxiety.

Integrated interpretation with respect to perceived stress (PSS):
Evidence supporting higher perceived stress: elevated trait anxiety (STAI, z ≈ +1.16) which has the strongest positive correlation with PSS in this dataset; subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) and objectively short nightly sleep (median ≈ 5.6 h, z ≈ -1.99); and circadian irregularity/fragmentation (reduced interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability) which are modestly associated with higher PSS. Evidence supporting lower/average perceived stress: low depressive symptom score (CES-D), frequent exercise and low resting heart rate (likely reflecting fitness), and only modestly reduced happiness/health satisfaction scores. Most quantitative correlations with PSS are small-to-moderate, so no single marker dominates the picture.

Conclusion regarding PSS group:
Taking the pattern as a whole, the balance of evidence suggests the participant is more likely to have elevated perceived stress relative to the study population. The elevated trait anxiety (a relatively strong correlate of PSS here), combined with marked objective sleep restriction and circadian irregularity—both of which are mechanistically and empirically linked to perceived stress—outweigh the mitigating signals from fitness and low depressive symptoms. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

64232,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"Psychological trait and symptom measures show a mixed but stress-relevant profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) is modestly elevated relative to the study sample and has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.31), which supports interpreting anxious disposition as a contributor to higher perceived stress for this participant. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are in the non-depressed range (score = 13, Z ≈ -0.03) and only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28), so depressive symptom burden does not strongly push the profile in either direction. Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17) and current self-reported happiness is relatively low (3.0, Z = -0.53); both of these dimensions show small negative correlations with PSS in the sample (happiness r ≈ -0.19), consistent with the expectation that lower subjective well-being accompanies greater perceived stress.

Subjective and objective sleep metrics present an important signal. The participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59), which typically aligns with higher perceived stress. Wearable-derived sleep quantity is notable for a relatively long median nightly sleep duration (8 h, Z = 1.01) but also for substantial inconsistency: sleep start time standard deviation is large (≈150 minutes, Z = 1.48) and sleep duration standard deviation is elevated (≈136 minutes, Z = 0.79). In the cohort these indices of sleep timing variability show small positive correlations with PSS (sleep start time SD r ≈ 0.16; sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.14), suggesting that the participant’s irregular sleep timing and variable nightly durations are more characteristic of individuals with higher perceived stress even though total time asleep is relatively high.

Cardiovascular and circadian features from the wearable indicate a generally normal resting cardiovascular baseline but reduced day-to-day regularity. Resting heart rate is within a typical range (≈59.4 bpm, Z = 0.15) and the mesor is slightly above average (77.3, Z = 0.46), with no strong correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.06–0.14). Nonparametric circadian measures point to relatively low interdaily stability (value = 0.22, Z = -1.56), indicating less consistent day-to-day structure in heart rate patterns; intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (Z = -0.46). These circadian irregularity metrics have only weak associations with PSS in the sample (|r| ≲ 0.17), but taken with the sleep timing variability they suggest fragmented or irregular daily schedules that are commonly linked to increased perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors provide both risk and protective signals. The participant reports engaging in sports frequently (three times a week or more, Z = 1.58), which in this sample is associated with lower PSS (r ≈ -0.13) and thus may buffer stress. Alcohol use is modest (beer and wine 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.9–1.0), and recreational drugs are reported at 1–2 times/month (Z = 3.52), the latter being an outlying value in the sample; correlations between substance use metrics and PSS are small in this cohort, so their direct contribution to perceived stress is uncertain. Social and recreational engagement is moderate (1–2 hours socializing, 1–2 hours internet), while sedentary hobbies and passive media use are minimal; lower reported happiness and slightly reduced self-esteem temper the potential protective effect of high exercise.

Integrative assessment and ranking relative to the cohort distribution. Several features that typically co-occur with higher perceived stress are present: an elevated trait anxiety score (STAI), subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 8), and pronounced variability in sleep timing and duration. Protective elements (ample median sleep duration and high sports participation) mitigate the risk signal to some degree, and objective cardiovascular baselines do not show a strong stress-related activation. On balance, the preponderance of evidence—particularly the trait anxiety together with disturbed subjective sleep and large sleep timing variability—leans toward a position in the higher half of the sample distribution for perceived stress. Therefore, a holistic judgment places this participant in the top 50% for PSS relative to the study population.

37404,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a relatively low burden of mood and trait anxiety symptoms. The participant’s CES-D score is 7 (Z = -0.66) and STAI–Trait is 35 (Z = -0.62), both below the sample mean and classified as ""not depressed"" / ""not anxious."" Self-esteem is high (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03) and academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.75–3.8). Subjective happiness and trust are modestly lower than peers (happiness Z = -0.53; trust Z = -0.46), but overall affective symptom measures and trait anxiety are more consistent with lower perceived distress than with elevated stress.

Lifestyle and behavioral indicators contain mixed signals but lean toward protective patterns. The participant reports regular exercise (exercised alone three times a week or more, Z = 1.07), minimal recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and limited sedentary/recreational screen time. Alcohol use is present (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94) but not extreme. Social time is somewhat lower than peers (socializing Z = -0.62), which could reduce some social buffering against stress. Academic success and frequent exercise are factors typically associated with lower perceived stress, whereas reduced socializing and a modestly lower happiness rating could modestly increase perceived stress risk.

Wearable-derived sleep duration is within a normative range (median 7 h 9 min, Z = -0.04), although subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep). Sleep timing shows some variability (sleep start SD ≈ 65 minutes, Z ≈ -0.39) but nap behavior is negligible. Thus objective sleep quantity is adequate while subjective sleep complaints are present, a combination that can be associated with intermittent sleep-related distress without pervasive sleep deprivation.

Cardiovascular and circadian metrics show fragmented and lower-amplitude daily rhythms. Interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = -1.56) and intradaily variability is elevated (0.74, Z = 1.37), with low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z ≈ -1.54) and a reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -1.54). Resting heart rate is modestly above the sample mean (60.8 bpm, Z = 0.32). These features indicate relatively irregular day-to-day structure and higher within-day variability of heart-rate patterns; such circadian fragmentation has been associated in the literature with greater physiologic stress and worse wellbeing. However, the participant’s mesor and many hourly deviations reflect a normal overnight trough and a typical evening acrophase (≈5:32 PM), suggesting basic circadian timing is intact despite reduced regularity and amplitude.

Integrating modalities with consideration of strength and direction of association with perceived stress: psychological self-report (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem, strong GPA, frequent exercise) provides the strongest evidence pointing toward lower perceived stress. Wearable signals (higher intradaily variability, low interdaily stability, blunted amplitude, and subjective PSQI = 7) provide countervailing evidence that some physiological rhythm disruption and subjective sleep disturbance are present and are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample (e.g., intradaily variability correlation with PSS ≈ 0.16; CES-D and STAI correlations with PSS are larger but the participant’s scores are low). Overall, the magnitude and consistency of low mood and trait-anxiety scores, coupled with protective lifestyle behaviors and adequate sleep duration, outweigh the moderate physiological circadian irregularity and subjective sleep complaint.

Conclusion — likelihood relative to the study distribution: considering the balance of low depressive and anxiety symptoms (both below the sample mean), high self-esteem and consistent exercise, alongside only moderate circadian/sleep irregularities, the preponderance of evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress (bottom 50%).

70492,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Psychological-self report profile: The participant reports a cluster of affective and trait indicators that, taken together, tend to align with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z ≈ +0.76) is elevated relative to the sample and shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D (score = 16, Z ≈ +0.28) sits near a typical screening cutoff and also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28). Self‑esteem is modestly below the sample mean (RSES score = 34, Z ≈ −0.59) and correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), consistent with self‑worth as a protective factor when higher. Subjective happiness is slightly above average (Z ≈ +0.55), but lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ −0.62) and the other affective measures together point toward more internal distress and vulnerability that are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress.

Sleep timing and variability: Objective sleep duration is near the sample median (median = 7h05m, Z ≈ −0.13), but sleep timing and regularity are notable risk features. Median sleep start time is extremely late (≈ 03:03 AM) and the participant shows high night-to-night variability in both sleep duration (SD ≈ 222 minutes; Z ≈ +2.75) and sleep start time (SD ≈ 138 minutes; Z ≈ +1.21). The PSQI score (6) indicates subjective sleep disturbance. The combination of late, inconsistent bedtimes and high variability is associated (in this dataset) with higher PSS (positive correlations with sleep timing variability), so the sleep profile is a salient contributor toward elevated perceived stress despite average total sleep time.

Circadian and heart-rate physiology: Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics present a mixed profile. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.6 bpm, Z ≈ −0.54), which by itself would not indicate elevated tonic autonomic arousal. However, circadian amplitude and MESOR are lower than the sample mean (amplitude Z ≈ −0.44; MESOR Z ≈ −0.60), and interdaily stability is modest rather than strong (value ≈ 0.43). Intradaily variability is near the sample center (Z ≈ −0.04) but correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), while measures of 24‑hour autocorrelation are lower (Z ≈ −0.28). Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs and daytime peaks, with particularly large negative deviations overnight; some of these nighttime deviations (early morning hours) have small positive correlations with PSS. Overall, the physiological signal is not uniformly elevated in arousal (low resting HR), but it does show reduced circadian amplitude and irregularity features that—within this study—associate with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns and lifestyle: The participant reports low habitual exercise (very infrequent solo exercise and little sports participation) and a moderately elevated frequency of beer consumption (1–2 times/week; Z ≈ +1.01). Time spent socializing and online are above average (socializing Z ≈ +0.95; internet use Z ≈ +0.85), while engagement in reading and active hobbies is low. These behaviors are mixed in relation to stress: low physical activity and higher alcohol frequency are risk factors that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress, whereas greater social time could be a buffer. Academic performance (GPA ≈ 3.4) is solid, which may mitigate some stress related to academics.

Holistic appraisal and PSS-group assignment: The strongest, most consistent indicators pointing toward higher perceived stress are elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (both moderately correlated with PSS), low self‑esteem and health satisfaction, subjective sleep disturbance combined with very late and highly variable sleep timing, and behavioral risk factors such as low exercise and relatively frequent alcohol use. Physiological data are mixed—resting HR is low (a counter-indicator), but circadian amplitude and regularity are reduced, and sleep/circadian irregularity metrics correlate positively with PSS. Balancing these signals, the preponderance of psychological symptoms and sleep/circadian irregularities that are positively associated with perceived stress outweigh the protective signs. On balance, the available multimodal evidence indicates this participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the sample distribution for perceived stress.

95543,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate a psychological profile consistent with relatively low perceived stress. Scores on symptom measures are markedly below the sample mean: depressive symptoms (CES-D) are very low (Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) is substantially low (Z = -1.81). Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI Z = -1.72), self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are above average (Happy Z = 1.64; Health Satisfaction Z = 1.3), and self-esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 1.52). The participant reports little to no substance use, regular social exercise (exercising with others three times/week), and no daily naps. Together, these self-reported indices (several of which have moderate correlations with PSS in the expected directions) provide converging evidence consistent with a lower-than-average perceived stress level.

Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a relatively regular and structured rhythm in heart-rate activity. Interdaily stability (Z = 1.08) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.57) are above average, and amplitude is above average (Z = 0.78), which together indicate a consistent day-to-day circadian pattern and robust day–night difference in physiological activity. Correlations provided suggest that greater circadian regularity and amplitude are modestly associated with lower PSS in this sample, supporting an interpretation that the participant’s circadian organization aligns with lower perceived stress.

Physiological arousal indicators are mixed but not strongly indicative of elevated stress. Resting heart rate and MESOR are somewhat higher than the sample mean (Resting HR Z = 1.02; MESOR Z = 1.22), which can reflect modestly higher baseline cardiovascular activity; these measures show small positive correlations with PSS in the dataset. Hourly aggregate deviations display the expected nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations in early morning) and an evening peak in mean heart rate (largest positive deviations in the 6–9 PM window), producing a clear daily rhythm. Importantly, the features most strongly associated in this dataset with lower PSS (higher amplitude and higher interdaily stability) are present, while elevations in resting heart rate are small in magnitude and not supported by subjective distress reports.

Sleep timing and variability present a nuanced picture: median nightly sleep duration is adequate (7 h 25 m, Z = 0.29) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = -0.92) and little napping. The participant’s median sleep start is late (about 02:25), but this timing is consistent (sleep-start SD Z = -1.08) and subjective sleep quality is good. Late but regular sleep timing can reflect lifestyle patterns common in student samples; correlations between later sleep timing and PSS in this dataset are small. Overall, objective sleep quantity and consistency, together with good subjective sleep, are more consistent with lower perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and pss_group decision: across domains, self-report measures (very low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, good subjective sleep, little substance use) provide strong evidence for lower perceived stress. Wearable circadian metrics reinforce this (high interdaily stability and amplitude), while small elevations in resting HR represent the main physiological signal that could point toward modest arousal but are not large and are not supported by subjective distress. On balance, the preponderance of psychological, behavioral, and circadian evidence indicates this participant is more likely in the bottom half of the study distribution for perceived stress (i.e., relatively low or average PSS).

67106,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report profile: The participant reports very low depressive symptomatology (CES-D score = 2, Z = -1.18) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 29, Z = -1.22), together with elevated self-reported well-being (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = 1.1; current happiness Z = 1.64) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (Z = 1.47). Academic indicators are strong (GPAs near the top of the scale) and substance use is absent. Recreational and social activities are relatively limited (very low time spent socializing, gaming, or internet use), and frequency of exercise is low; however, correlations between these activity items and PSS in the sample are small. Overall, the self-report domain presents a pattern more consistent with lower perceived stress: low affective symptom burden and favorable indicators of well-being that are negatively or only weakly related to PSS in the study correlations.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart-rate-based circadian metrics show high day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.64, Z = 1.9; autocorrelation at 24h Z = 2.07) and relatively low fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = -0.53). The participant’s resting heart rate and MESOR are slightly below the study mean (RHR = 56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22; MESOR Z = -0.21), and rhythm amplitude is modestly elevated (Z = 0.59) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:20 PM). Aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart rate troughs and clear afternoon–evening peaks, with especially high relative heart-rate elevations in the early evening. In the context of the study, greater circadian stability and higher 24-hour autocorrelation are associated with lower PSS (negative correlations), and the participant’s strong regularity and low intraday fragmentation therefore align with lower perceived stress.

Sleep pattern and variability: Objective sleep quantities indicate a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 hours 46 minutes (Z = -0.51), with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ~98 minutes) and a late median sleep onset (~01:29). The PSQI score of 6 is just above common clinical thresholds for disturbed sleep but has a mildly negative Z-score relative to the sample (Z = -0.33), indicating this participant’s subjective sleep complaints are not markedly elevated compared to peers. Correlations between sleep duration measures and PSS in the sample are small. The late sleep timing could reflect evening chronotype or schedule constraints; while shorter and late sleep can be risk factors for higher stress, in this case the associations in the broader data are modest and do not outweigh the other robust indicators of lower stress.

Integration and interpretation for perceived stress: Convergent evidence across modalities points toward relatively low perceived stress. Strongest contributors to this inference are the very low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms together with high self-esteem and happiness, and the wearable-derived signature of robust, regular circadian rhythms and low resting heart rate—features that the sample correlations link (albeit modestly) to lower PSS. Countervailing signals are limited: slightly short and late sleep and minimal socializing/exercise are potential stress-related risk factors, but their correlations with PSS are small in this dataset and the participant’s overall physiological and affective profile is more consistent with the lower half of the PSS distribution. Given the balance of evidence, the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study population with respect to perceived stress.

83612,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant shows elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 58, Z = 1.65) relative to the study sample, a feature that has a positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31) and is commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Depressive symptom frequency (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18) is near the sample mean and below common screening thresholds, indicating limited concurrent depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES = 29, Z = -1.29), a stable trait that modestly correlates with perceived stress in the sample (r ≈ -0.15) and can amplify subjective stress reactivity. Current self-rated happiness is somewhat above average (score = 4, Z = 0.55), and health satisfaction is near the sample mean, suggesting some countervailing subjective well-being. Overall, the self-report profile contains a mix of elevated anxiety and lower self-esteem (both linked to greater stress vulnerability) alongside otherwise average mood and health ratings.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac patterns: Heart rate–based circadian features indicate reduced regularity and greater fragmentation of daily physiology. Interdaily stability is low (0.28, Z ≈ -1.07) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (Z ≈ -1.29), while intradaily variability is elevated (0.70, Z ≈ 1.09). This combination signals relatively unstable day-to-day rhythm and more within-day fragmentation of activity/arousal, characteristics that in this sample show small-to-moderate positive associations with perceived stress (intraday variability r ≈ 0.16; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17). The participant’s MESOR and amplitude are modestly below the sample mean (MESOR Z ≈ -0.54; amplitude Z ≈ -0.48), and resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, Z ≈ -0.42), consistent with greater cardiovascular fitness or parasympathetic tone; resting HR shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14) in the sample but is itself on the lower side here. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor display the expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations during the early morning) and daytime peaks in the afternoon; small positive correlations between heightened early-morning deviations (3–6 AM) and PSS suggest that any residual nocturnal arousal or less pronounced nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation may relate to higher perceived stress in this sample.

Sleep and behavioral rhythms: Median nightly sleep duration is slightly below the sample mean (6 h 42 m, Z ≈ -0.59) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 67 minutes, Z ≈ -0.76). Median sleep onset is around 00:51 with about 84 minutes of variability, and there are effectively no naps reported. Subjective sleep quality on the PSQI is in the “good” range (score = 5, Z ≈ -0.8). The mixed pattern—somewhat short and variable sleep but not poor subjective sleep quality—may partially buffer or mask physiological indicators of stress, yet the circadian fragmentation metrics suggest that sleep timing regularity (rather than perceived sleep quality) is an area of disruption relevant to stress.

Lifestyle and social behavior: Substance use is low, exercise is modest (1–2 times per week alone and with others), and organized sports participation is minimal. Socializing time is below average (Z ≈ -0.62) and trust in others is relatively low (Z ≈ -1.10). Academic performance is high (GPA ≈ 3.7–3.82), which could reflect effective coping or selective pressures. Overall, the participant’s behavioral profile shows limited risky substance behaviors and reasonable fitness markers, but reduced social engagement and lower interpersonal trust—factors that can be associated with greater perceived stress or fewer social buffers against stress.

Holistic interpretation regarding perceived stress: Several convergent indicators point toward higher perceived stress relative to the study sample. The strongest single signal is elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.65), which correlates substantially with PSS in the sample and typically drives higher perceived stress scores. Circadian instability and intraday fragmentation (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, low 24-hour autocorrelation) are additional objective signals that, in this dataset, are associated with higher PSS and imply physiological irregularity consistent with elevated stress reactivity. Lower self-esteem and reduced social trust further align with vulnerability to higher perceived stress. Countervailing evidence includes generally good subjective sleep quality, low substance use, a relatively low resting heart rate (possible fitness), and modestly positive current happiness; these factors could moderate the subjective experience of stress. Taken together, the preponderance of evidence (notably high trait anxiety and circadian fragmentation) supports classification of the participant’s perceived stress in the upper half of the study distribution.

The Rosenberg self-esteem score is comparatively high (Z = 1.38) and current happiness is elevated (Z = 1.64); these scales show small negative correlations with PSS (self-esteem r = -0.15; happiness r = -0.19), supporting an expectation of lower perceived stress in this participant. Health satisfaction is also above average (Z = 1.22), further aligning with lower stress-related self-report indicators.

Wearable-derived physiological data show consistent circadian structure and relatively low basal cardiovascular arousal. Resting heart rate is low at 49 bpm (Z = -1.08), and the heart-rate mesor is slightly below the cohort mean (71.36 bpm, Z = -0.35). Cosinor-derived amplitude is modest (11.06, Z = 0.09) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (about 4:17 PM), and non-parametric rhythm metrics (interdaily stability = 0.40, intradaily variability = 0.52) are close to cohort averages (Zs ≈ -0.1–0.2). Aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions (largest negative deviations ~-27 bpm between 3–5 AM) and an afternoon/evening elevation peaking around 6–7 PM (+20 bpm), indicating intact sleep-related quiescence and a daytime activity-related rise in cardiovascular tone. The circadian and resting physiology profile (low RHR, preserved nocturnal dip, near-average regularity) is consistent with lower physiological stress load; metric correlations with PSS are small and mixed, but the low resting HR and structured rhythm modestly support lower perceived stress.

Sleep and behavioral patterns present a mixed picture but do not strongly indicate elevated perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 17 minutes (Z = -1.11), shorter than the cohort median, and the PSQI score is 6 (classified as disturbed sleep, Z ≈ -0.33), suggesting some subjective sleep difficulty. Sleep timing is relatively late (median start ~00:48) with moderate night-to-night variability (start-time SD ≈ 113 minutes, Z = 0.66), both of which can be associated with strain in some contexts; however, the correlations between these sleep metrics and PSS in the sample are small (e.g., sleep duration r ≈ -0.05, sleep start-time variability r ≈ 0.18). Lifestyle indicators—regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more, Z = 1.07), low recreational drug use, moderate socializing (2–3 hours, Z = 0.95), and high reading time (Z = 1.30)—are generally supportive of adaptive coping and lower perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and PSS-group assessment: across modalities, the strongest signals point toward relatively low perceived stress. Low depression and anxiety scores, elevated self-esteem and happiness, high health satisfaction, regular exercise, and physiological markers of low resting cardiovascular arousal and preserved nocturnal dipping all align with a lower-PSS profile. Sleep duration is below cohort average and PSQI indicates mild disturbance, and sleep timing variability is notable; these are the main signals that could temper the conclusion but, given their small correlations with PSS in this sample and the predominance of protective indicators, the preponderance of evidence favors a PSS score in the lower half of the study distribution. Therefore, the participant is most consistent with the bottom 50% of the cohort on perceived stress.

35987,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed profile of affective and behavioral risk factors for elevated perceived stress. The participant scores in the upper range for trait anxiety (STAI = 51, Z ≈ +0.96), a measure that shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), suggesting anxiety-proneness that is commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep problems are also evident (PSQI = 8, Z ≈ +0.59, classified as disturbed sleep), which is plausibly linked to greater perceived stress in student samples. Self-esteem is relatively low (Rosenberg = 28, Z ≈ -1.43), and satisfaction with physical health is below average (score 3/7, Z ≈ -0.95); both of these characteristics are conceptually and empirically associated with higher stress vulnerability. Depressive symptoms are low-to-moderate (CES-D = 10, Z ≈ -0.34) and do not indicate substantial current depressive burden, which slightly moderates the concern that mood disorder processes alone are driving stress reports.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are consistent with limited behavioral coping resources and with schedules that may compound stress. The participant reports minimal structured physical activity or sports (exercise items Zs ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and limited socializing (social time Z ≈ -0.62), factors that often buffer against perceived stress but are reduced here. Alcohol use is modest (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1.01) and recreational drug use absent. Academic performance shows a downward GPA trend across terms, which could contribute to situational stress, though causal direction is not determined from cross-sectional measures.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology provide a nuanced view. Objective sleep is shorter than average for the study sample (median sleep 6 h 32 min, Z ≈ -0.81) with a late median sleep start time (≈ 02:45), indicating a delayed sleep schedule. Sleep timing is fairly consistent across days (sleep start SD ≈ 54 min, Z ≈ -0.64), and naps are absent. The combination of late bedtimes and objectively short sleep aligns with the subjective report of disturbed sleep and represents a behavioral pattern that can increase perceived stress through sleep restriction and circadian misalignment.

Circadian and heart-rate features overall show relatively strong day-to-day regularity and robust amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm, which are typically associated with more structured routines and, in this sample, with lower PSS (Interdaily Stability = 0.62, Z ≈ +1.74; Amplitude Z ≈ +1.16; both correlations with PSS are modestly negative). Resting heart rate is slightly below sample mean (57.2 bpm, Z ≈ -0.11), and mesor is modestly elevated (78 bpm, Z ≈ +0.56) without strong correlations to PSS. Hourly aggregate deviations reveal pronounced evening and late-night heart-rate elevations (notably 9–11pm and around midnight, Zs up to ≈ +2.27) with larger negative deviations in the early morning (around 4–6am, Zs down to ≈ -1.30). This pattern suggests relatively high physiological arousal in the late evening coupled with low early-morning arousal; evening hyperarousal and late sleep onset are consistent with the participant’s late sleep schedule and may sustain perceived stress through reduced opportunity for sleep restoration. Non-parametric variability (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.81) is somewhat elevated and shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), indicating some within-day fragmentation that can relate to higher stress.

Weighing the multimodal evidence yields a coherent picture: trait anxiety is elevated and has one of the stronger positive associations with PSS in this dataset; subjective sleep disturbance and objective short, late-timed sleep are present; self-esteem and health satisfaction are low; and behavioral supports such as exercise and socializing are limited. These self-report and behavioral characteristics are counterbalanced to some degree by preserved circadian regularity and robust heart-rate amplitude—features that in this sample tend to relate to lower PSS—but those physiological strengths appear insufficient to offset the combination of elevated trait anxiety, disrupted sleep timing/quality, low self-esteem, and limited behavioral coping. On balance, the preponderance of indicators most strongly associated with higher perceived stress supports placement in the higher half of the study distribution for PSS.

79341,15.0,0.038860103626943004,"Self-report measures show a profile of broadly average mood and trait anxiety with selective strengths. The CES-D score (10) is below the population mean (Z = -0.34) and is classified as ""Not depressed,"" indicating few self-reported depressive symptoms over the past week. Trait anxiety (STAI = 41) is near the cohort average (Z = -0.03) and described as ""anxious"" in absolute terms, but it does not stand out as markedly elevated relative to peers. Self-esteem is high-normal (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11). Sleep quality self-report (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) is on the favorable side of the sample. Behavioral reports show health-promoting patterns: no recreational substance use reported, frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more; Z = 1.07), participation in sports, and modest socializing (1–2 hours/day). The one notable subjective low is momentary happiness (current score = 2, Z = -1.61), indicating lower self-reported positive affect relative to the sample; however, this stands alongside multiple indicators of adaptive behavior rather than high symptom burden.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics support a pattern of physiological regularity and low tonic arousal. Interdaily stability (0.52, Z = 0.91) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.44, Z = 0.98) are relatively high, consistent with a regular 24-hour structure in heart-rate-based rhythms. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.59, Z = 0.32), indicating some fragmentation within days, but not extreme. The MESOR (64.24, Z = -1.32) and resting heart rate (48.25 bpm, Z = -1.18) are lower than the cohort average, suggesting low resting cardiovascular tone and probable good fitness or lower sympathetic drive. Amplitude is slightly below average (10.19, Z = -0.19) and the acrophase (~4:54 PM) falls in a typical afternoon period. Hourly aggregated deviations from mesor show marked nocturnal decreases and pronounced daytime elevations, with the largest positive deviations around midday (e.g., 12–1 PM: +20.05, Z = 1.87) and consistent afternoon increases—patterns that reflect expected daily activity-linked heart rate increases rather than chronic hyperarousal.

Objective sleep behavior is consistent with the self-report and not strongly suggestive of stress-related sleep disruption. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 46 minutes (Z = -0.51), slightly below the sample mean but within a typical range, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration and start time are not extreme (SDs of 99 minutes and 68 minutes, Z near 0). Mean daily naps are essentially absent (0.0, Z = -0.86). The combination of regular circadian markers, reasonable total sleep, and lack of excessive napping aligns with preserved sleep–wake functioning rather than the fragmented or shortened sleep profiles often associated with higher perceived stress.

Integrating subjective and objective data yields a coherent picture: the participant demonstrates several resilience-related markers (regular circadian rhythm, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, minimal substance use, and generally low depressive symptom scores) that are inversely associated with perceived stress in the cohort correlations (e.g., interdaily stability and autocorrelation negatively related to PSS). Countervailing signals are limited and modest in magnitude: a lower momentary happiness rating, slightly elevated intradaily variability, and average trait anxiety. Correlations between many wearable features and PSS in the dataset are small in absolute terms, and where present tend to indicate that better rhythm regularity and lower tonic heart rate associate with lower PSS. On balance, the multimodal evidence more strongly supports a lower-to-average level of perceived stress rather than elevated perceived stress.

83536,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Psychological self-report and trait measures indicate a profile consistent with relatively low perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 4) and trait anxiety (STAI = 26) are both well below the study mean (z-scores -0.97 and -1.51, respectively), and these scales have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31), so the participant’s low scores on these measures point toward lower PSS. Self-esteem and momentary well-being are also favorable (Rosenberg-like self-esteem z = 0.4, current happiness 5/7 with z = 1.64), which, given their modest negative correlations with PSS in the sample, further support a lower perceived stress state. Health satisfaction is high (6/7, z = 1.3), and substance use is minimal; these behavioral features align with less psychosocial strain in this participant relative to peers.

Daily activities and social behaviors likewise trend in a direction that would generally predict lower perceived stress. The participant reports regular socializing (2–3 hours, z = 0.95) and substantial time listening to music (>4 hours, z = 2.06), the latter potentially reflecting a common coping or leisure activity. Exercise frequency is moderate (1–2 times per week, both alone and with others) while participation in organized sports is absent; overall activity levels and low substance use do not indicate behavioral markers that are typically associated with elevated PSS in this cohort.

Objective sleep and circadian features provide a mixed but not strongly adverse picture. Median nocturnal sleep duration is near 7 hours 5 minutes (z ≈ -0.13), which is within a normative range, but the PSQI is 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”), indicating some subjective sleep difficulties. The participant’s sleep start time is late (median ~02:25 AM) and shows moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes), suggesting an irregular sleep schedule. Irregular bedtimes and a PSQI >5 are characteristics that can relate to higher stress, but the objective total sleep time and lack of napping suggest adequate sleep opportunity overall.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signals largely align with a lower-stress profile, with some modest indicators of circadian fragmentation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.4 bpm, z ≈ -0.21), a pattern typically associated with better cardiovascular fitness and often lower stress; resting HR correlates modestly with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14), so a lower value is consistent with lower perceived stress. Mesor (≈74 bpm) and amplitude (≈10.6) are near the sample mean, and acrophase around early evening (≈5:12 PM) indicates a typical daytime peak. Non-parametric circadian metrics show average interdaily stability (0.41, z ≈ 0.0) but a somewhat elevated intradaily variability (0.65, z ≈ 0.74), which suggests more within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology; intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), so this element could contribute weakly to higher perceived stress. Hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal dips and expected daytime elevations; correlations between these hourly deviations and PSS are small and mixed, providing limited incremental evidence.

Weighing the evidence holistically: multiple robust indicators point toward lower perceived stress (very low depressive and trait anxiety scores, high happiness and health satisfaction, low resting heart rate, minimal substance use, and normative sleep duration). The primary countervailing signals are a slightly elevated PSQI, late and variable sleep timing, and mildly increased intradaily variability in wearable data—each of which has only small associations with PSS in this sample. Taken together, the preponderance and magnitude of indicators favor placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

67608,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a profile generally consistent with relatively low perceived distress. Scores on depressive symptom and trait-anxiety inventories are very low (CES-D = 1.0, z ≈ -1.28; STAI-Trait = 26, z ≈ -1.51), and positive indicators are elevated (subjective happiness z ≈ +1.64; self-esteem z ≈ +0.96). Health satisfaction and academic performance (GPA near 4.0 across terms) are also above average for the sample. These features—particularly the low depressive and anxiety scores and the high happiness and self-esteem—are robust protective signals that typically co-occur with lower perceived stress in student samples.

Behavioral and lifestyle data largely support a lower-stress interpretation but add nuance. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; sports 1–2 times per week) and only moderate alcohol use (1–2 times per week), both of which are commonly associated with better stress management. Conversely, measures of social activity are notably low (socializing with friends reported at ~15 minutes or less, z ≈ -2.2), and several recreational sedentary hobbies are absent. Limited social contact is a potential risk factor for perceived stress or reduced buffering resources, but in this case its correlation with PSS is small and other positive psychosocial indicators are strong, reducing the likely impact of low social time on overall perceived stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology present a mixed picture. Objective sleep quantity is within a normative range (median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 12 min, z ≈ 0.02) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 58 min, z ≈ -0.98) and highly consistent sleep onset timing (median start ≈ 01:14, start-time SD ≈ 26 min, z ≈ -1.24). Subjective sleep quality, however, is flagged as “disturbed” on the PSQI (score = 7), indicating that the participant experiences some perceived sleep problems despite adequate and consistent duration. Physiologically, the participant shows a low resting heart rate (≈ 53.6 bpm, z ≈ -0.54), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic arousal, and an acrophase in mid-late afternoon (≈ 4:08 PM) that is not atypical.

Circadian regularity and within-day activity patterns indicate two notable deviations that could relate to stress vulnerability. Intradaily variability (a nonparametric index of fragmentation between rest and activity) is elevated (value ≈ 0.77, z ≈ +1.58), suggesting frequent transitions or fragmentation in activity patterns across the day. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show prominent evening activation (large positive deviations at 8–9 PM, z ≈ +2.32, and 10–11 PM, z ≈ +1.49) together with pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate during early sleep hours. Elevated intradaily variability and evening physiological arousal can reflect circadian misalignment, late-evening behavioral activation, or stress-related hyperarousal; both metrics show modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample. Nonetheless, the participant’s strong baseline psychosocial resources and low resting heart rate moderate how concerning these physiological signals are for overall perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and ranking decision: weighing the multimodal evidence, the preponderance of signals indicates lower-than-average perceived stress. Very low scores for depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, regular exercise, strong academic outcomes, and low resting heart rate collectively point toward a PSS placement in the lower half of the study distribution. Contrasting signals—subjective sleep disturbance, late sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability, and marked evening physiological activation—suggest areas of circadian or sleep-related strain that could increase stress vulnerability under additional demands, but these factors do not, in isolation, outweigh the substantial protective indicators observed. On balance, the participant is more consistent with a PSS score in the bottom half (lower or average perceived stress) of the study population.

19735,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report measures indicate notable affective burden that is relevant to perceived stress. The participant endorses a high level of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 34, Z = 2.15) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56). Self-esteem is lower than the study average (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01), and momentary happiness and health satisfaction are modestly below the cohort mean. The PSQI score of 6 places subjective sleep quality in the disturbed range despite objectively adequate nightly sleep duration; taken together these self-report features are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress and tend to co-occur with higher PSS scores (the CES-D and STAI here show the largest positive correlations with PSS in the available data).

Lifestyle and activity reports add further context consistent with increased psychological burden and reduced social buffering. The participant reports relatively frequent alcohol use (1–2 times/week) and occasional recreational drug use (1–2 times/month; very high Z-score relative to peers), limited socializing (about 15 minutes or less per day, Z ≈ -2.2), minimal group exercise or sports, and little engagement in leisure media or social activities. These behavioral patterns (low social time, limited group-based exercise and low recreational engagement) reduce common protective resources against stress and align with the elevated internalizing symptoms reported on inventories.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics present a mixed but partly protective profile. Objective nightly sleep duration is fairly long (median 7 h 48 m, Z = 0.77) with modest variability in nap behavior, but the median sleep start time is very late (roughly 02:01), and the PSQI indicates subjective disturbance—this mismatch suggests that although total sleep time is adequate, sleep timing or quality may be suboptimal for daytime functioning. Heart-rate–derived circadian measures show a relatively large amplitude (Z = 1.13) and mesor near the cohort mean; interdaily stability and intradaily variability are close to average. The hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal drop and daytime elevations consistent with a clear diurnal rhythm. In the context of stress, higher amplitude and reasonable circadian stability are often associated with lower perceived stress (and those features here have small negative correlations with PSS), suggesting that physiological circadian robustness may partially buffer perceived stress even when self-reported mood is poor.

Integrative interpretation and PSS placement: the strongest, most direct signals in this profile come from self-report affect measures—marked depressive symptomatology and elevated trait anxiety—both of which are positively associated with higher PSS in the sample and have moderate effect sizes here. Behavioral indicators (low social contact, limited leisure, some substance use) reinforce a higher-stress risk profile. Wearable physiology shows some protective features (clear diurnal amplitude, adequate sleep duration, low resting heart rate) that moderate the picture but carry smaller associations with PSS in the cohort. On balance—weighted by the magnitude and psychological proximity of the self-report indicators—the evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress is more consistent with the higher half of the study distribution.

Self-esteem is elevated relative to peers (RSES Z ≈ 0.68), and overall satisfaction with physical health is high (6/7, Z ≈ 1.3). These trait-level measures are typically associated with lower perceived stress—indeed correlations in the dataset show positive relationships between PSS and both depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31) and a negative relationship with self-esteem (r ≈ -0.15). A counterpoint in the self-report set is current happiness, which is lower than average (current happiness Z ≈ -0.53), a small signal that momentary well-being may be reduced even as stable traits suggest resilience.

Sleep and subjective sleep quality: Objective sleep duration is relatively long (median 8 h 13 min, Z ≈ 1.28), but sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:35 AM) and both sleep duration and sleep start time show elevated night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 169 minutes, Z ≈ 1.55; sleep start SD ≈ 141 minutes, Z ≈ 1.27). Subjectively, the participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 8; Z ≈ 0.59). These mixed findings—ample total sleep but irregular timing and subjective disturbance—suggest that sleep patterns could be a modest source of strain: variability in sleep timing/duration has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), and the self-reported poor sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress in prior work.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular features: Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a comparatively robust and regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.56, Z ≈ 1.24) and intradaily variability is low (0.25, Z ≈ -2.08), consistent with a structured, low-fragmentation daily pattern. Amplitude of the rhythm is relatively high (14.04, Z ≈ 1.05) and MESOR is slightly above average (76.44, Z ≈ 0.34). The acrophase near early evening (~5:58 PM) and hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nadirs overnight (~-20 bpm around early morning) and peaks in the afternoon/evening (~+14–16 bpm), reflecting preserved day–night separation in physiological arousal. Correlational directions in the dataset link greater circadian stability and amplitude with lower PSS (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; amplitude r ≈ -0.17), so the participant’s strong rhythmicity points toward lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate is slightly above average (61.4 bpm, Z ≈ 0.39); since RHR has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), this is a weak indicator in the direction of greater perceived stress but is of modest magnitude.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising alone ≥3×/week; exercise-related Z-scores > 0.9), which is generally protective and weakly associated with lower PSS in this sample. Alcohol use is moderate (beer 1–2×/week) and recreational or non-prescribed drug use is absent. Leisure patterns show relatively high video-game use (1–2 hours daily; Z ≈ 2.47), and moderate internet and sedentary hobby engagement; however, correlations between these recreational habits and PSS are small or mixed in direction, so they do not strongly shift the stress inference.

Integration and implications for perceived stress: Multiple convergent signals point toward relatively lower perceived stress. Low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, elevated self-esteem and health satisfaction, regular and high-amplitude heart-rate circadian rhythms, low intradaily variability, and frequent exercise are all associated (in the provided correlations and in broader literature) with lower PSS. Opposing indicators are present but smaller in magnitude: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8), late and inconsistent sleep timing, slightly elevated resting heart rate, and somewhat lower momentary happiness. Taken holistically, the dominant pattern is one of trait-level resilience and coherent physiological rhythms that would be expected to correspond with perceived stress at or below the study median. The sleep irregularity and subjective sleep complaints provide a plausible pathway by which stress could be increased, but these are outweighed by the stronger and more consistent lower-risk signals across psychometrics and circadian measures.

96613,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Psychological self-report and symptom measures point toward relatively low internalizing symptom burden and psychological vulnerability in this participant. Scores on the CES-D (7.0; Z = -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 34.0; Z = -0.72) are both below sample means, indicating infrequent depressive symptoms and lower chronic anxiety proneness compared with peers. Self-esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 0.96), and overall satisfaction with physical health is high (health satisfaction Z = 1.05), which are traits typically associated with lower perceived stress. Momentary reported happiness is modestly below average (Z = -0.53), and the PSQI score is just above the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), which introduces a subjective sleep-related complaint; however the magnitude of depressive and anxious symptom scores is small and their population correlations with PSS are moderate (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), suggesting that the low symptom reports would tend to predict lower PSS.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology from the wearable provide a mixed but largely stress-protective profile. The participant shows long, regular nocturnal sleep (median sleep duration 8h29m, Z = 1.61) with low variability in sleep start times (SD = 34 minutes, Z = -1.06), indicating consistent sleep timing despite a late median sleep onset (around 01:31). Mean daily naps are infrequent but slightly elevated (0.15/day, Z = 0.94). Resting heart rate is notably low (47.8 bpm, Z = -1.23), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or high vagal tone, which—given the observed small positive correlation between resting HR and PSS—would be associated with lower perceived stress. Circadian cosinor features show a relatively high amplitude (Z = 1.26) and a clear afternoon/evening acrophase (≈5:26 PM), along with modest interdaily stability (Z = 0.33). Higher intradaily variability (Z = 0.67) indicates some daytime fragmentation of activity or physiology; because intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), this feature provides a weak signal toward somewhat elevated stress but is outweighed by the other circadian indicators of robust rhythm and low resting HR.

Behavioral and social factors further contextualize perceived stress. The participant reports frequent group-based exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more; Z = 1.23) and moderate socializing (1–2 hours; near sample average), which are protective social-behavioral features associated with lower perceived stress. Sedentary leisure time is relatively high (sedentary hobby 1–2 hours, Z = 1.41) and solitary exercise is absent (Z = -1.93), but the strong presence of social physical activity mitigates risks associated with sedentary pursuits. Alcohol use (beer 1–2 times per week; Z = 1.01) is above average but not extreme; its weak negative correlation with PSS here suggests limited direct predictive weight. Overall, behavioral data emphasize social engagement and physical conditioning that tend to reduce perceived stress.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, elevated self-esteem and health satisfaction, long and regular objective sleep, and low resting heart rate are convergent indicators associated with lower perceived stress relative to the study sample. Minor contra-indications include a borderline PSQI sleep complaint, modest intradaily variability indicating fragmentation, elevated sedentary hobby time, and some alcohol use; these factors provide small opposing signals but do not outweigh the stronger indicators of lower stress. On balance, the preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant’s perceived stress (PSS) is more likely to lie in the bottom half of the study distribution.

Self-esteem is higher than average (RSES Z = 0.68), and overall satisfaction with physical health is relatively high (health satisfaction Z = 0.97). These trait-level indicators are typically associated with reduced perceived stress. Contrastingly, subjective sleep quality is modestly disturbed (PSQI = 7; classification “Disturbed Sleep”), and current self-reported happiness is somewhat lower than the sample mean (Z = -0.53). Behavioral reports show frequent group exercise (exercised with others three or more times per week, Z = 1.23) but very limited time socializing outside of exercise (socializing with friends ~15 minutes or less, Z = -2.20). Alcohol use is present at a moderate level (beer 1–2×/week, Z = 1.01); use of non-prescribed drugs is minimal. Overall, self-report data emphasize psychological resilience (low depression/anxiety and higher self-esteem) alongside some sleep disturbance and restricted social time.

Wearable-derived circadian, heart rate, and sleep patterns
Objective wearable metrics show a robust and regular heart rate circadian rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.58, Z = 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.51, Z = 1.57) are substantially above the population mean, and intradaily variability is relatively low (0.38, Z = -1.16). Cosinor-derived amplitude is high (15.81, Z = 1.63) with a mesor somewhat above average (78.8 bpm, Z = 0.66); resting heart rate is around the sample mean (58.1 bpm, Z ≈ 0). The aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced overnight declines in heart rate and a marked daytime/late-afternoon peak (largest positive deviation at 3–4 pm, value = +23.2, Z = 2.58), consistent with consolidated sleep and strong daytime activity. Sleep objectively is of adequate duration on median (7 h 29 m, Z = 0.37) with modest day-to-day variability in duration (SD ≈ 100 min) and a relatively consistent, though late, sleep start time (median start ≈ 01:27 AM; start-time SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z = -0.63). Mean daily naps are rare. In sum, the wearable data indicate stable, high-amplitude circadian organization and consolidated sleep duration, despite a late habitual sleep onset.

Integration relative to perceived stress (PSS)
Several of the participant’s strongest signals align with lower perceived stress as indexed across the study: lower self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, higher self-esteem, high health satisfaction, frequent structured social exercise, and objective markers of circadian regularity and high amplitude (all of which correlate in the sample with lower PSS or are theoretically stress-protective). Specifically, higher interdaily stability and amplitude tend to associate with reduced perceived stress in the population (correlations in the dataset are negative), and this participant’s values are well above average on both metrics. Objective sleep duration is adequate and sleep timing is consistent night-to-night, which also typically supports lower perceived stress. Conversely, there are a few signals that could be consistent with elevated stress for some individuals: subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI > 5), habitual sleep onset is late (around 1:30 AM), and self-reported momentary happiness and socializing time outside exercise are low—features that sometimes accompany higher perceived stress. Resting heart rate and mesor are near average or slightly elevated, which has a modest positive correlation with PSS in the sample, but these effects are small compared with the protective pattern of circadian regularity and low trait symptoms.

Evidence weighing for top- versus bottom-half placement on PSS
Evidence for lower or average perceived stress (bottom 50th percentile):
- CES-D and STAI trait scores below the sample mean (Zs -0.24 and -0.43).
- Elevated self-esteem (Z = 0.68) and high health satisfaction (Z = 0.97).
- Strong objective circadian regularity (interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation Zs > 1.4) and high amplitude (Z = 1.63), which in the sample trend toward lower PSS.
- Adequate median sleep duration and low intradaily variability (less fragmented patterns), both protective against stress.

Evidence for higher perceived stress (top 50th percentile):
- PSQI indicating subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7).
- Late habitual sleep onset (~1:27 AM) and low self-reported happiness and minimal non-exercise socializing (large negative Z for socializing), which can accompany higher perceived stress.
- Small positive correlations between resting heart rate / some overnight HR deviations and PSS, though these correlations are modest.

Holistic conclusion
Balancing all modalities, the preponderance of evidence points toward lower-than-average perceived stress. Trait symptom measures (depression and anxiety proneness), elevated self-esteem and health satisfaction, frequent social exercise, and objectively strong and regular circadian organization are the most salient and consistent signals and they are the features most strongly associated with reduced PSS in the sample. Subjective sleep complaints and late sleep timing are notable caveats but appear less dominant in the overall pattern. On balance, this participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half (lower or average) of the study distribution for perceived stress.

71089,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report psychological profile and inferred perceived stress: The participant reports modestly elevated symptoms on trait measures that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (trait) score is 46 (z ≈ 0.46), and the CES-D depressive symptom score is 16 (z ≈ 0.28); both measures have positive correlations with PSS in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28). In contrast, global self-esteem is relatively low (Rosenberg score = 27, z ≈ -1.57), a characteristic that tends to co-occur with greater stress vulnerability even though its sample correlation with PSS here is modest (r ≈ -0.16). Taken together, these self-report indices indicate a pattern of elevated internalizing symptoms and reduced self-regard that would be expected to map onto higher perceived stress at the group level.

Behavioral lifestyle factors and subjective sleep: Several lifestyle features present a mixed picture for stress risk. The PSQI total is 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”), but the wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 12 min, z ≈ 1.26) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 63 min, z ≈ -0.85) and consistent sleep timing (median start ~00:50, start-time SD 39 min, z ≈ -0.96). These objective sleep regularity and quantity metrics are generally protective against perceived stress, even if the participant subjectively endorsed some sleep disturbance. Physical activity is minimal (no reported exercise or sports; exercise frequency z-scores strongly negative), and recreational screen/internet use is relatively high; low exercise and high sedentary/recreational screen time are behavioral patterns that can contribute to elevated stress perception over time. Social engagement appears moderate (2–3 hours socializing, z ≈ 0.95), which may provide some buffering against stress.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure: Cardiac indices indicate modestly elevated cardiovascular tone: resting heart rate = 71.2 bpm (z ≈ 1.55) and MESOR = 86.93 (z ≈ 1.77), both somewhat higher than the study mean and weakly positively associated with PSS (resting HR r ≈ 0.14). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir and daytime elevation; there is no clear sign of blunted diurnal amplitude (amplitude z ≈ 0.83) that would indicate severely dysregulated physiological rhythms. Importantly, circadian regularity metrics are relatively strong: interdaily stability = 0.57 (z ≈ 1.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation = 0.47 (z ≈ 1.23), while intradaily variability is low (z ≈ -0.81). Higher interdaily stability and lower intradaily fragmentation are associated with lower perceived stress in this sample (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), suggesting that the participant’s well-structured daily rhythm and consistent sleep timing are factors that mitigate stress-related physiological arousal.

Integrated interpretation and likely PSS placement: Evidence is mixed but tilts toward higher perceived stress. Psychological symptom measures (elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, low self-esteem) and physiologic indicators of increased cardiovascular tone provide signals that commonly correspond to greater perceived stress. Protective factors—regular, sufficient sleep and strong circadian stability—likely blunt some of that signal. Given the relative magnitudes (notably moderate positive correlations of STAI and CES-D with PSS, and the participant’s above-average anxiety/depression z-scores combined with elevated resting heart rate), the balance of evidence favors placement in the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress rather than the lower half. Therefore, the participant is more likely to have a PSS score in the top 50% of the study population.

22688,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant’s questionnaire profile is characterized by low symptom burden on mood and anxiety scales and relatively positive self-evaluations. CES-D (score = 5; Z = -0.86) and STAI–Trait (score = 27; Z = -1.41) are both well below sample means, indicating infrequent depressive symptoms and low trait anxiety relative to peers. Self-esteem and momentary well-being are elevated (SelfEsteem Z = 1.1; Current Happiness Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction is above average (Z = 1.22). These measures typically correlate negatively with perceived stress (self-esteem and happiness correlations with PSS are modestly negative: -0.15 and -0.19 respectively), and the low CES-D and STAI scores (correlations with PSS 0.28 and 0.32) point in the direction of lower perceived stress in this participant.

Behavioral and social context: Lifestyle items show limited solitary sedentary hobbies and no recreational drug use, moderate alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times per week), and frequent social exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more; Z = 1.23). Social and physical activity patterns (regular group exercise and some daily socializing) are psychosocial resources that are typically associated with reduced perceived stress. Academic performance is high (GPA consistently ~3.9) and may reflect competence and control in the academic domain, which also tends to relate to lower perceived stress in student samples.

Sleep and recovery-related physiology: Actigraphy-derived sleep metrics show relatively long and consistent sleep: median nightly sleep ~8 h 2 min (Z = 1.05) with low nap frequency and moderate night-to-night timing stability (sleep start SD ~47 minutes, Z = -0.79). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) is classified as good. Nocturnal heart rate shows pronounced nocturnal dipping (hourly deviations from mesor reach -15 to -19 bpm during early morning hours), which is a physiological sign of nightly recovery and lower nocturnal autonomic arousal. These objective and subjective sleep/recovery indicators generally support a lower perceived stress profile (PSQI correlates modestly with PSS in many samples, and robust nocturnal dipping is often associated with better stress recovery).

Circadian rhythmicity and daytime physiology: Summary circadian features are mixed but not strongly indicative of elevated stress. Mesor (~73.9 bpm, Z ≈ 0) and resting heart rate (~60.4 bpm, Z = 0.27) are near the sample average; amplitude is modestly below average (Z = -0.66). Nonparametric circadian metrics show low interdaily stability (Z = -1.15) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = -1.79), suggesting less rigid day-to-day regularity in heart rate timing. Intradaily variability is low (Z = -1.8), indicating relatively low fragmentation of activity within days. The combination—less stable day-to-day timing but low within-day fragmentation—could reflect a moderately flexible schedule (some variability in daily timing) without marked physiological fragmentation. Correlations between these circadian metrics and PSS are small in magnitude (ranging roughly ±0.17), so their contribution to inferring perceived stress is secondary to the strong self-report indicators and sleep/recovery signs.

Weighing evidence for PSS placement: Evidence supporting a lower or average perceived stress level (bottom half of the sample) is substantial: very low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, good subjective and objective sleep duration and nocturnal cardiac recovery, and engagement in social exercise. Potential signals that could pull in the other direction are modest: somewhat reduced interdaily stability and lower circadian amplitude (which can be associated with stress in some contexts) and a resting heart rate slightly above the sample mean. However, these physiological caveats are small in magnitude (Z-scores generally between -1.8 and +0.3) and their correlations with PSS are weak. Overall, the preponderance of psychological and behavioral indicators aligns with relatively low perceived stress. Based on the balance of multimodal evidence, the participant’s PSS is most consistent with being in the bottom half of the study distribution.

38815,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report profile: The participant endorses modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) while reporting low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24). Subjective sleep quality is somewhat disturbed (PSQI = 7, just above the common clinical cutpoint), although median self-reported/recorded sleep duration is near 7 hours (median 7 h 3 m, Z = -0.16). Self-esteem is near the sample mean (RSES = 38), current happiness is above average (current happiness Z = 0.55), and global health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 1.05). The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more, Z = 1.07) and limited recreational drug use; alcohol use is moderate (beer 1–2×/week). Taken together, self-report shows a mixed risk–resilience profile: elevated trait anxiety and some sleep disturbance point toward higher perceived stress risk, but relatively low depressive symptoms, higher happiness and health satisfaction, and consistent exercise are protective against higher perceived stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac features: Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a relatively low mean level (MESOR = 65.9, Z = -1.10) and a pronounced daily amplitude (amplitude = 12.6, Z = 0.58) with an acrophase in the early evening (≈ 5:55 PM). Resting heart rate is low (47.5 bpm, Z = -1.27), consistent with aerobic fitness or low tonic cardiac arousal. Nonparametric rhythm metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.31, Z = -0.82) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (0.56, Z = 0.10). Aggregated hourly deviations show the largest positive deviations from mesor in the mid- to late-afternoon/evening (notably ~4–7 PM), and the deepest trough in early morning hours; correlations between these hourly deviations and PSS are generally small. Together, the wearable signal suggests robust day–night amplitude and low resting cardiac tone (protective), but somewhat irregular day-to-day structure and modest within-day fragmentation (which can be associated with greater perceived stress).

Sleep and behavioral stability: Objective sleep timing is moderately late (median sleep start ~00:50) and sleep timing variability is modestly lower than average for this sample (sleep start SD Z = -0.35), but night-to-night sleep duration is relatively inconsistent (sleep SD = 136 minutes, Z = 0.80). Mean daily nap frequency is low (0.12, Z = 0.61). Elevated sleep variability and intradaily variability have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample, suggesting these patterns could contribute to perceived stress; however the participant’s overall sleep duration is within a normative range and naps are infrequent.

Integrated interpretation relative to perceived stress: Several indicators associated with higher perceived stress are present but modest in magnitude—trait anxiety is above the sample mean and there is evidence of disturbed sleep and greater day-to-day sleep duration variability, both of which correlate positively (though weakly-to-moderately) with PSS in the study. Offsetting these risk indicators are multiple protective features: low resting heart rate and low MESOR (suggesting low tonic physiological arousal), higher circadian amplitude (linked in this sample to lower PSS), higher self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, low depressive symptoms, and frequent exercise. The effect sizes of the protective markers and their consistency across modalities (subjective well-being, fitness/HR indices, activity amplitude) outweigh the relatively small-to-moderate signals that point toward elevated stress. On balance, the multimodal evidence is most consistent with a perceived stress level in the lower-to-average range of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

72885,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Summary of self-report affective and trait indicators:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46) and modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 15; Z = 0.18), together patterns that in this sample are positively associated with higher perceived stress (STAI–PSS correlation ≈ 0.31; CES-D–PSS correlation ≈ 0.28). Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 31; Z = −1.01), a trait that shows a small negative association with PSS in the cohort (r ≈ −0.15), indicating that lower self-regard may modestly relate to greater perceived stress. Subjective happiness is slightly above average (current happiness score = 4; Z = 0.55) and the CES-D classification labels the participant “not depressed,” which temper but do not eliminate concerns about elevated stress given the concurrent anxiety and sleep disturbance indicators.

Sleep timing and subjective sleep quality:
Sleep metrics point to substantial sleep disruption. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is short (5 h 59 min; Z = −1.5) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is high (PSQI = 11; Z = 1.98), indicating clinically notable sleep disturbance subjectively. Sleep onset is very late (median start ≈ 03:44), and sleep timing variability (SD of start ≈ 81 minutes) is non-negligible. Short sleep duration, late sleep timing, and high PSQI scores are established correlates of greater perceived stress; in this dataset PSQI has a strong relationship to stress, and here the participant’s PSQI and short sleep provide robust evidence consistent with elevated perceived stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features:
Heart-rate circadian summary metrics indicate reduced regularity and dampened amplitude: interdaily stability is low (0.25; Z = −1.32), amplitude from cosinor is below average (7.68; Z = −1.0), and mesor and resting heart rate are modestly below the sample mean (mesor = 68.6 bpm, Z = −0.74; resting HR = 54.4 bpm, Z = −0.45). Low interdaily stability and reduced amplitude reflect a weaker, less robust heart-rate circadian rhythm across days, a pattern often associated with irregular schedules and greater stress vulnerability. The hourly aggregate deviations show relative elevation during a late-night hour (1–2 am: +6.66 above mesor; Z = 2.04) alongside large negative deviations in the early morning hours (4–7 am: −11 to −17 bpm), consistent with a shifted and compressed sleep–wake/physiological rhythm congruent with very late sleep timing. Overall, the wearable physiology supports a profile of altered circadian structure and atypical timing rather than a pattern of sustained high tonic cardiovascular arousal.

Behavioral context and lifestyle correlates:
Behavioral data include several potentially stress-relevant patterns. Recreational drug use is reported at a relatively high frequency (1–2 times/week; Z-scores strikingly elevated), and solitary or absent exercise and low socializing with peers are evident (exercise with others “not at all,” socializing less than peers). Daily recreation includes elevated video game time (1–2 hours; Z = 2.47). These behaviors may reflect coping strategies or lifestyle choices that accompany irregular schedules and poorer sleep; correlations between these specific activities and PSS in this sample are modest, but their combined presence alongside sleep disturbance and trait anxiety increases the likelihood of higher perceived stress.

Weighing evidence for low/median versus high perceived stress:
Evidence consistent with a lower or average PSS score: the participant’s CES-D remains below clinical thresholds and current happiness is slightly above sample mean; resting heart rate and mesor are lower than average, which can sometimes index lower tonic physiological arousal. Some individual correlation coefficients (e.g., trust, health satisfaction) show weak relationships with PSS, limiting definitive conclusions from any single measure.

Evidence consistent with elevated PSS: multiple independent indicators point toward higher perceived stress—elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.46), markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11; Z = 1.98), short and very late sleep (median sleep ≈ 6 hours; median sleep start ≈ 03:44), reduced interdaily stability and circadian amplitude (Z’s ≈ −1.3 and −1.0), low self-esteem (Z = −1.01), and behavioral markers (frequent recreational drug use, limited social exercise) that often co-occur with stress. Several of these features have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the study (e.g., STAI, CES-D, aspects of sleep disturbance), and the convergence across psychological, subjective sleep, and circadian physiology domains increases confidence that perceived stress is elevated relative to the cohort median.

Overall conclusion:
Taken holistically, the balance of evidence—especially the combination of elevated trait anxiety, pronounced subjective sleep disturbance with very late sleep timing and short duration, low circadian regularity and amplitude, and behavioral factors—supports classification in the higher half of the sample distribution for perceived stress. While a few measures (e.g., non-elevated CES-D classification and lower resting HR) could be seen as moderating factors, they do not outweigh the convergent indicators linked to higher PSS in this participant.

71193,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Self-report measures indicate substantial affective and cognitive burden that would be expected to elevate perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score is 39 (Z = 2.67) and STAI–Trait is 60 (Z = 1.85); both scores are well above the study mean and the provided correlations with the PSS (CES-D r = 0.28; STAI r = 0.31) point toward positive associations with higher perceived stress. Complementary self-report indicators mirror this pattern: low self‑esteem (RSES = 28, Z = −1.43), low momentary happiness (score = 2.0, Z = −1.61), and a PSQI of 8 (Z = 0.59, classified as disturbed sleep) together suggest elevated subjective distress and poorer perceived sleep quality. These self-report signals are large in magnitude (especially the depressive symptom score) and align with constructs that tend to co-occur with higher PSS scores.

In contrast, wearable-derived circadian and sleep-related physiology shows a pattern more consistent with preserved circadian organization and adequate sleep duration — features typically associated with lower perceived stress. Heart-rate cosinor/non‑parametric metrics indicate relatively high rhythm stability and amplitude (interdaily stability = 0.60, Z = 1.57; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.54, Z = 1.82; amplitude Z ≈ 0.96) and a resting heart rate near the sample mean (59 bpm, Z = 0.10). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced overnight troughs and large afternoon peaks (notably strong positive deviations around 2–4 pm with Z-scores ≈ 2.0–2.3), reflecting a robust day–night contrast rather than blunted diurnal variation. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 2 min, Z = 1.05) with low night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 41 minutes, Z ≈ −0.93), and naps are infrequent. Several of these wearable features have small negative correlations with PSS (e.g., interdaily stability r = −0.12; autocorrelation r = −0.18; amplitude r = −0.17), suggesting physiological markers that would usually predict lower perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle data are mixed and offer modest additional context. The participant reports little alcohol or drug use and minimal team or social exercise, reports limited socializing, relatively high sedentary hobby time and 1–2 hours/day of video gaming. Low socializing and low exercise have modest associations with worse mood/stress in many samples; however, the dataset’s provided correlations for these specific items are small and inconsistent. Academic performance (GPAs reported) and BMI are within typical ranges and do not provide clear stress signal here. Subjective health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z ≈ −0.53), consistent with the elevated self‑reported affective symptoms.

Holistic integration favors elevated perceived stress. The clearest and largest signals in this profile are the markedly elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES‑D and STAI), both of which are positively correlated with PSS and have large Z-scores relative to the sample. Although the wearable circadian and sleep physiology indicate a relatively well‑structured rhythm and adequate sleep duration (factors that tend to protect against perceived stress), these objective signals are smaller in their correlations with PSS and are in tension with the strong self‑reported affective burden and disturbed subjective sleep. Given the magnitude of the self-report symptom elevations and their direct, positive associations with perceived stress, the balance of evidence indicates the participant is likely to have a PSS score in the upper half of the study distribution.

98760,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Psychological trait and symptom indicators point toward comparatively low affective burden and adaptive self-evaluations. Self-report measures show a low depressive symptom score (CES-D = 7; Z = -0.66) and below-average trait anxiety (STAI = 33; Z = -0.82). Self-esteem and momentary positive affect are elevated relative to the sample (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = 0.82; current happiness Z = 1.64). Academic functioning is high (term GPAs ≈ 3.9–4.0) and reported substance use is absent across categories (Z-scores strongly negative). These profiles—low depression and anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, no substance use—are all features that, in the study sample, tend to co-occur with lower perceived stress.

Behavioral lifestyle features are mixed with respect to stress risk. The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three or more times per week; Z = 1.07) and minimal recreational screen time or socializing, indicating active health behavior but limited social engagement (socializing Z ≈ -1.41). Health satisfaction is slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.53). The sleep questionnaire, however, signals relative sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9; Z = 1.05), and median nightly sleep duration from the wearable (6 h 52 min; Z = -0.39) is modestly below the cohort mean. The self-report and wearable-derived sleep features suggest subjective sleep problems and a constrained sleep opportunity that could contribute to perceived stress even when mood and anxiety scores are low.

Wearable circadian and cardiac metrics indicate a generally robust but delayed and somewhat variable daily pattern. Cosinor-derived amplitude is relatively large (amplitude = 15.86; Z = 1.64), and interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.47; Z = 0.5), both features that are associated in the sample with lower PSS (amplitude and stability correlations with PSS are negative). Resting heart rate is low (53 bpm; Z = -0.61), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and typically associated with lower stress in this cohort. At the same time, intradaily variability (0.67; Z = 0.88) is elevated, and the participant shows pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (large positive deviations from mesor across 6–9 pm; Zs up to ≈2.9) alongside very low nocturnal heart rates. The combination of strong day-night contrast (high amplitude) with higher short-term variability suggests structured wake activity but some within-day fragmentation or late-evening arousal, which may reflect late-evening activity or circadian delay (median sleep start ~01:58). In the study, intradaily variability and late/variable sleep timing show small positive correlations with PSS, whereas larger amplitude and greater interdaily stability correlate with lower PSS.

Weighing evidence for low versus elevated perceived stress: indicators supporting lower perceived stress are stronger and more consistent—low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, and robust circadian amplitude/interdaily stability. Indicators that could elevate perceived stress are primarily sleep-related and circadian-timing features: clinically elevated PSQI (score = 9), late median sleep onset (~02:00), modestly shortened sleep duration, and elevated intradaily variability and evening arousal. Those sleep and timing features have modest associations with higher PSS in the sample but are more circumscribed than the multiple trait and physiological markers indicating lower stress. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with perceived stress at or below the cohort median than with relatively elevated perceived stress.

Conclusion (holistic): Considering the preponderance of low symptom scores, adaptive self-evaluations, fitness-associated physiology, and circadian amplitude/stability, tempered by sleep disturbance and late sleep timing, the overall evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

95374,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report measures indicate elevated affective symptom burden and sleep complaints that align with higher perceived stress. The CES-D score is 28 (Z = 1.53; classified here as “Depressed”), and the STAI–Trait score is 47 (Z = 0.56), both of which are positively correlated with PSS in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05), and current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61). The participant reports little-to-no exercise and no substance use, and spends notable time socializing (3–4 hours/day, Z = 1.74) and on video games (1–2 hours/day, Z = 2.47). These self-report features—elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, disturbed sleep, low happiness, and low engagement in physical activity—are all commonly associated with higher perceived stress and, in this dataset, have positive associations with PSS.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics provide additional evidence of sleep irregularity despite average total sleep time. Median sleep duration is approximately 7 h 15 m (Z = 0.09), but night-to-night variability is high (sleep duration SD = 219 minutes, Z = 2.68), and sleep onset is very late on average (median start ≈ 03:11), with substantial variability (start-time SD Z = 1.43). The participant also naps more frequently than peers (mean daily naps = 0.22, Z = 1.75). High variability in timing and duration of sleep—paired with a PSQI indicating disturbed sleep—suggests inconsistent sleep patterns and sleep fragmentation, factors that tend to co-occur with greater perceived stress (and here show small positive correlations with PSS).

Cardiovascular and circadian measures show a pronounced day–night contrast but an evening-shifted pattern of physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is relatively low (51.4 bpm, Z = -0.8), while cosinor-derived amplitude is high (amplitude Z = 2.06), indicating a large diurnal range in heart rate. The heart-rate acrophase is in the evening (≈ 7:41 PM), and aggregated hourly deviations show marked elevations in the late evening (notably 7–8 PM, Z = 3.42, and 12–1 AM, Z = 2.04). Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are modest-to-high (Z ≈ 0.42 and 1.06, respectively), indicating consistent scheduling across days, but intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z = 0.17). The evening-centered peaks in heart rate, together with very late sleep onsets and high evening recreational screen time (video games, TV), are consistent with heightened physiological arousal late in the day, which can exacerbate subjective stress and impair sleep onset.

Integrative interpretation and evidence weighing for perceived stress: multiple independent signals converge on elevated perceived stress. Affect measures (CES-D, STAI) that correlate positively with PSS are above the sample mean; subjective sleep disturbance and objective sleep timing variability are elevated; behavioral markers (low exercise, late evening screen use) are consistent with stress-related coping patterns; and physiological data show evening physiological activation despite a low resting heart rate. Counterbalancing evidence includes average total sleep duration, a low resting heart rate (which can reflect fitness), good academic performance (GPAs in the mid–high 3.6–3.75 range), and absence of substance use—features that do not support very high stress. On balance, however, the preponderance of affective symptoms, disturbed sleep timing and variability, and evening physiological arousal support placement in the higher half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

71985,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological trait and symptom profile:
Self-report measures show a broadly normative internalizing symptom profile with some mixed signals. The CES-D score (14) is near the population mean (Z = 0.07) and falls in the ""not depressed"" range, while trait anxiety (STAI = 41, Z = -0.03) is essentially average for the cohort. Self‑esteem is modestly below average (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59), and current happiness is somewhat above average (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55). Subjective sleep quality is reported as relatively good (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Taken together, these survey measures do not indicate elevated depressive or anxiety symptom burden relative to the study population; the only notable self-report vulnerability is slightly reduced self‑esteem and comparatively low health satisfaction (2.67, Z = -1.2).

Daily behavior and lifestyle:
Behavioral indicators point to a generally health‑preserving pattern. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07) and minimal substance use (no beer, wine/liquor, or recreational/non‑prescribed drugs; Z-scores strongly negative). Time use shows moderate screen-based leisure (internet 2–3 h, watching videos 1–2 h) and an elevated self-reported video-game time (Z = 2.47), but also modest socializing (1–2 h). These habits (regular exercise, low substance use, some social contact) are commonly associated with better stress regulation and align with the participant’s normative symptom scores.

Sleep and circadian organization:
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show relatively stable and restorative patterns. Nightly sleep duration is typical for the cohort (median 7 h 18 m, Z = 0.14), with no recorded daytime napping (Z = -0.86). Sleep start time is around 00:21 with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 99 minutes, Z = 0.35). Objective circadian regularity is strong: interdaily stability is high (0.66, Z = 2.07) and 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z = 1.74), indicating a consistent day-to-day activity/physiology schedule. Intradaily variability is near average (Z = 0.03). This combination—adequate sleep duration, low nap frequency, and highly regular circadian structure—is generally protective against perceived stress and aligns with the reported good subjective sleep quality.

Physiological activity and heart rate patterns:
Cardiovascular indicators suggest good cardiovascular fitness and a pronounced diurnal pattern. Resting heart rate is low for the sample (50 bpm, Z = -0.97), and the mesor is below average (66.36, Z = -1.04). The cosinor-derived amplitude is higher than average (13.91, Z = 1.01), and the typical hourly deviations show marked nocturnal heart rate suppression (values about -20 to -25 bpm overnight) and clear daytime elevations peaking in mid‑afternoon (e.g., 1–2 pm value = +19.0, Z = 1.88). These features indicate a robust day–night separation in physiological arousal. Several of these circadian/physiological features (high interdaily stability, higher amplitude, clear daytime peaks) are negatively correlated with PSS in the cohort, suggesting that this physiological profile tends to co-occur with lower perceived stress.

Integration with perceived stress indicators:
Multiple independent data streams point toward relatively lower perceived stress in this participant compared with the study population. Objective markers of circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = 2.07; 24‑hour autocorrelation Z = 1.74), higher circadian amplitude (Z = 1.01), low resting heart rate (Z = -0.97), adequate and subjectively good sleep (PSQI Z = -0.8; median sleep duration near mean), frequent exercise (Z = 1.07), and low substance use together form a convergent pattern that, in the cohort, is associated with reduced PSS (many of these features show negative correlations with PSS). Self-reported measures (CES-D, STAI) are near average rather than elevated, and current happiness is above average—both also consistent with lower perceived stress. The main countervailing signals are somewhat lower health satisfaction (Z = -1.2) and a mildly reduced self‑esteem (Z = -0.59), which could reflect localized concerns but do not by themselves indicate broadly elevated perceived stress in the context of the other objective and subjective data.

Conclusion regarding PSS percentile group:
Weighing objective wearable markers (strong circadian regularity, robust amplitude, low resting HR), behavioral protections (frequent exercise, minimal substance use), and near‑average to favorable self‑report symptoms, the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant’s perceived stress is more likely in the lower half of the cohort distribution (bottom 50%). The data do not show multiple convergent signals of elevated perceived stress; instead they show features that, in this sample, correlate with lower PSS.

43125,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Psychological self-report profile and implications for perceived stress:
The participant reports markedly elevated depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 37, Z = 2.47) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53, Z = 1.16). Both of these self-report indices are established correlates of perceived stress and in this dataset show positive correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.29, STAI r ≈ 0.32), indicating that higher scores on these measures tend to co-occur with greater perceived stress. Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73) and current happiness is modestly below average (Z = -0.53); these lower positive-affect and self-evaluation indicators are consistent with the raised depressive/anxiety burden and provide additional subjective evidence for elevated psychosocial strain rather than an absence of stress.

Sleep timing, subjective sleep quality, and circadian/physiological regularity:
Objective sleep duration is within the typical range (median 7 h 28 m, Z = 0.35) but the participant shows a markedly delayed sleep schedule (median sleep start ~02:00) with relatively low night-to-night variability in start time (SD ~45 min, Z = -0.82). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52), indicating disturbed sleep despite overall adequate duration. Circadian metrics from heart rate show a relatively high amplitude (Z = 1.36) and a typical evening acrophase (~6:29 PM), with moderate interdaily stability (IS = 0.44, Z = 0.25) and modest 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 0.48); intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (Z = -0.39). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced reductions in early-morning hours (large negative deviations around 2–7 AM) and elevated activity-related deviations in late evening and around midday. Taken together, these profiles suggest a robust but delayed circadian rhythm with subjective sleep disturbance and late sleep timing—patterns that commonly co-occur with elevated stress and affective symptoms even when total sleep time is adequate.

Behavioral health, substance use, and social/physical activity patterns:
The participant reports minimal physical activity or organized sports and does not exercise alone or with others (exercise frequencies Z ≤ -1.58 to -1.93). Recreational drug use and frequent beer use are reported at comparatively high levels (recreational drugs 1–2×/week, Z = 5.44; beer three times/week, Z = 1.72). Socializing time is below average and sedentary hobbies/reading are reported as not done. These behavioral patterns—low exercise, limited social engagement, and elevated substance use—are consistent with coping strategies that can accompany higher perceived stress and with reduced behavioral resilience. Correlations between these specific behaviors and PSS in the dataset are generally small, but the combination of elevated substance use, low exercise, and reduced social engagement strengthens the inference from the affective symptom measures that perceived stress is likely elevated.

Physiological baselines and their relation to stress:
Resting heart rate is slightly below the sample mean (RHR = 54.8 bpm, Z = -0.4), and the mesor is somewhat above average (78.48, Z = 0.62). Hourly deviation patterns indicate pronounced evening increases in heart rate relative to the mesor and deep overnight reductions consistent with consolidated sleep. Correlations of several early-morning heart-rate deviations with PSS are small-to-moderate positive (e.g., 3–6 AM r ≈ 0.19–0.21), suggesting that individuals with higher early-morning arousal tend to report higher stress; however, this participant's wearable shows large negative deviations in those early hours, indicating low physiological arousal while asleep. Overall, the physiological data do not contradict the self-report evidence of psychosocial strain but also do not provide a simple autonomic signature of high perceived stress in isolation.

Holistic assessment and ranking relative to the study population:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest signals pointing toward elevated perceived stress are the markedly high depressive symptom score (CES-D Z = 2.47), elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.16), and poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = 1.52). These measures are known and observed in this dataset to correlate positively with PSS and reflect substantial emotional and cognitive load. Behavioral indicators (high recreational substance use, low exercise and social activity) further align with patterns typically associated with higher perceived stress. Physiological and wearable measures (circadian amplitude, sleep timing, heart-rate patterns) are consistent with a delayed and somewhat strained schedule but do not offset the strong self-report indicators. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress level would lie in the higher half of the study distribution.

98117,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate substantial affective symptom burden and features commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. The participant’s depressive symptom score on the CES-D is 33 (z = 2.05), and trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) is 53 (z = 1.16); both are well above the study mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is also poorer than average (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), self-reported happiness is low (current = 2.0, z = -1.61), and self‑esteem is below average (Rosenberg = 32, z = -0.87). These clustered self-report elevations in negative affect and sleep disturbance are consistent with heightened perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators further reinforce the pattern of psychosocial strain. The participant reports minimal socializing (≈15 minutes or less; z = -2.20), no reported alcohol or recreational drug use (substance use z-scores are low), and little to no participation in exercise or sports (exercise z-scores strongly negative). Daily screen-based activities are elevated—internet use is >4 hours (z = 2.19) and watching videos 2–3 hours (z = 1.91)—which, together with low social engagement and low physical activity, are behavioral configurations often associated with greater stress and poorer mood in young adults.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures show marked irregularity in sleep timing and variability that align with higher stress. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 37 m; z = -0.71), but more striking are the very large standard deviations: sleep duration SD = 234 minutes (z = 3.02) and sleep-start-time SD ≈ 280 minutes (z = 4.33), indicating highly variable and delayed sleep timing (median start ~04:03). Both sleep-timing irregularity and variability have positive correlations with PSS in this sample (sleep variability r ≈ 0.14–0.18), suggesting these features are likely contributors to greater perceived stress for this participant.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm features show modestly elevated tonic arousal and an evening-shifted activity pattern. Resting heart rate = 66.4 bpm (z = 0.98) and mesor ≈ 81 (z = 0.96) are above average; the acrophase of heart-rate rhythm is in the early evening (≈6:27 PM) and aggregate hourly deviations show a pronounced evening peak (notably +14 bpm around 5–6 PM). Together these indicate a higher daytime/evening cardiovascular level and later peak activity, consistent with the late sleep timing. Non-parametric circadian features are mixed: interdaily stability is near average (0.4, z ≈ -0.08) while intradaily variability is relatively low (z ≈ -1.73), so within-day fragmentation is not high despite strong night-to-night timing irregularity. Several of the wearable metrics that are elevated here (resting HR, mesor, sleep variability) show small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.21), again pointing toward higher perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation and PSS group assignment: across modalities the preponderance of evidence indicates elevated psychosocial stress. High depressive and trait-anxiety scores, poor subjective sleep quality, very high night-to-night sleep timing and duration variability, low social contact and physical activity, elevated evening cardiovascular arousal, and behavioral patterns (heavy internet/screen time) collectively align with profiles associated with higher perceived stress. There are a few mitigating signs (very low substance use, moderate interdaily stability), but these do not outweigh the consistent signal from affective, sleep, social, and physiological domains. On balance, the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

24883,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures indicate a profile with relatively low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 9, z ≈ -0.45) and only modest elevations in trait anxiety (STAI = 42, z ≈ 0.07). Self‑esteem is notably elevated relative to the sample (RSES z ≈ +1.5), and academic performance is high (GPA values ≈ 3.9–4.0). Together these features constitute psychological resources that typically buffer perceived stress: low depressive symptom burden, preserved self-worth, and high academic functioning. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and liquor 1–2×/week), recreational drug use is absent, and health satisfaction is somewhat below the sample mean (z ≈ -0.7), which suggests some ambivalence about physical health but not a clear indicator of high distress.

Daily activities and social behavior show limited engagement with typical social and physical buffers: the participant reports very little exercise with others, minimal sports participation, and low time spent socializing or in other recreational hobbies. These behavioral patterns reduce routine social contact and structured physical activity, which can weaken coping resources during stressful periods. The combination of minimal social/recreational engagement and low exercise frequency represents a potential behavioral risk for elevated perceived stress, even though substance use is only moderate and not excessive.

Sleep and circadian physiology point to a delayed and somewhat irregular schedule. Median sleep onset is very late (≈ 03:00), median nightly sleep duration is just under seven hours (6 h 53 m, z ≈ -0.38), and the PSQI score of 6 meets a common cut-point for disturbed sleep. Wearable-derived circadian measures show reduced amplitude and reduced interdaily stability (amplitude z ≈ -1.11; interdaily stability z ≈ -0.99), indicating a relatively flattened and less-regular 24-hour heart-rate rhythm across the recording period. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated relative heart rate around midnight–2am (large positive deviations) and larger negative deviations across early morning hours; interpreted alongside the 3:00 AM median sleep start, this pattern is consistent with evening/nighttime arousal and a delayed sleep schedule rather than a stable diurnal rest–activity pattern. Sleep timing irregularity (sleep start SD ≈ 69 minutes) and the disturbed PSQI align with small positive correlations to perceived stress in the dataset, but effect sizes reported in the available correlations are modest.

Physiological markers do not suggest marked chronic autonomic activation: resting heart rate is relatively low (52.2 bpm, z ≈ -0.71), and overall mesor is slightly lower than the sample mean (69.0 bpm, z ≈ -0.67). Low resting heart rate is commonly seen in physically conditioned individuals but can also reflect other factors; given the participant reports low exercise frequency, the low resting rate here should be interpreted cautiously. Circadian regularity metrics (low intradaily variability and autocorrelation at 24 h near sample mean) point to reduced day-to-day structure but not robust signs of sustained physiological hyperarousal across the sample period.

Weighing evidence for likely perceived stress level: factors that would support lower or average PSS (bottom half) include low depressive symptoms, only average trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, strong academic performance, and absence of substance misuse. Factors that would support higher perceived stress (top half) include disturbed sleep, a very late and irregular sleep schedule, limited social engagement, and some circadian flattening — each associated in the literature with greater perceived stress, but in this participant the wearable and self-report correlations to PSS provided are small-to-moderate and many objective indices (resting HR, mesor) are lower than average. Overall, protective psychological resources and the absence of substantial mood symptomatology outweigh the moderate behavioral/circadian risk indicators in terms of expected association with PSS in this sample.

Conclusion: integrating survey and wearable data, the preponderance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress is more likely to fall in the lower or average range of the study distribution (bottom 50%). This conclusion recognizes some behavioral and sleep-related risk factors that could elevate stress transiently but finds them insufficient, given the participant’s low depressive symptoms, elevated self-esteem, and only modest trait anxiety, to place the participant in the top half of PSS scores.

66815,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report psychological profile: On standardized self-report measures the participant shows relatively low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and trait anxiety near the study mean (STAI = 41, Z ≈ -0.03). Self-esteem is above average (RSES Z = 0.54) and momentary happiness and interpersonal trust are notably high (happiness Z = 1.64; trust Z = 1.47). Sleep quality by questionnaire is slightly better than the sample average (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8, classified as ""Good Sleep""). Together, these survey indicators point toward generally favorable psychological functioning and subjective well-being rather than an elevated symptom profile; the two strongest survey correlates with PSS in the dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28) are only modestly elevated for this participant, not suggesting strong risk for high perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports minimal substance use (alcohol and recreational/non-prescribed drugs all “not at all,” Z-scores notably low) and an active social-exercise pattern (exercising with others three or more times per week, Z = 1.23). Sedentary and screen-based recreational activities are minimal relative to peers. Academic performance (GPAs near 3.9) and healthy BMI (≈23) further indicate stable functioning in academic and health domains. These behavioral markers (regular social exercise, low substance use, high academic performance) are typically associated with lower perceived stress or protective resilience in student samples.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: Objective sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of about 7 h 6 min (Z = -0.11) with low night-to-night variability (sleep-duration SD ≈ 40 minutes, Z = -1.38). Median sleep start time is late (about 01:49), but the timing is moderately consistent (sleep-start SD ≈ 56 minutes, Z = -0.6) and subjective sleep quality is good. Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate indicate comparatively stable rhythms (interdaily stability = 0.51, Z = 0.83) and a relatively large circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = 1.64). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -0.78) but the overall profile suggests a robust day–night modulation of physiology. These objective features (stable rhythms, strong amplitude, consistent ~7 h sleep) are typically associated with lower perceived stress in group-level analyses (interdaily stability and amplitude correlations with PSS are negative or small).

Cardiovascular patterning and activity timing: The participant’s resting heart rate is unusually low (45.8 bpm, Z = -1.47), consistent with high aerobic fitness or low baseline arousal. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show large negative deviations overnight (deep dips between ~2–8 AM) and pronounced positive deviations in late afternoon/evening—most notably a very large peak around 5–6 PM (value = +38.4, Z = 4.07) and elevated values through the evening (e.g., 9–10 PM value Z = 3.01). Given the participant’s high evening exercise-with-others frequency and low resting heart rate, these elevated evening heart-rate deviations are plausibly explained by scheduled physical activity rather than sustained stress-related autonomic arousal. Correlations between many of these hourly deviations and PSS are small; overall the low resting HR, strong amplitude, and stable circadian markers more strongly point away from high chronic physiological stress.

Integration and PSS-group inference: Across modalities the preponderance of evidence aligns with lower-than-average perceived stress. Survey indicators (low CES-D, near-average STAI, high happiness/trust, good PSQI) and behavioral markers (regular social exercise, low substance use, high academic performance) are consistent with bottom-half PSS scores. Objective physiology supports this: low resting HR, stable and high-amplitude circadian rhythm, and consistent ~7-hour nightly sleep argue against a profile of chronically elevated perceived stress. There are a few neutral or mixed signals (late sleep timing, modest intradaily variability), but they are not large and do not outweigh the convergent evidence suggesting relatively lower perceived stress. On balance, the participant is most consistent with a PSS score in the bottom half of the study distribution.

89161,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report measures indicate a profile of generally low affective symptom burden and relatively high subjective wellbeing. The participant reports very low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4, Z ≈ -0.97) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z ≈ -1.02). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (RSES Z = +1.52; Current Happiness Z = +1.64), and health satisfaction is above average (Z = +1.38). Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range on the PSQI (score = 5, Z ≈ -0.8). Taken together, these survey indicators that most strongly correlate with perceived stress (notably trait anxiety and depressive symptoms) point toward relatively low perceived stress compared with the study population.

Behavioral and lifestyle reports largely align with low-to-moderate stress exposure but include a few potential risk signals. The participant reports substantial social and leisure engagement (listening to music and socializing both high Z-scores, +2.06 and +2.53 respectively) and moderate alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week). One outlier in the self-report set is a very high Z-score for “Recreational Drugs” (Z = +5.44) despite an explicit “Not at all” response for “Non-prescribed Drugs,” which is inconsistent and should be treated cautiously; if accurate, elevated recreational drug use could represent an atypical coping behavior. Internet use is above average (3–4 hours, Z ≈ +1.52), which can accompany late-evening schedules but is not by itself diagnostic of elevated stress. Overall, most behavioral indicators (socializing, exercise frequency, reported health satisfaction) support lower perceived stress, with the recreational-drug item an anomalous datapoint to flag for follow-up.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics show a largely robust physiological baseline with some indicators of circadian fragmentation and late-evening arousal. Resting heart rate and MESOR are below the study mean (Resting HR ≈ 53.9 bpm, MESOR ≈ 67.6 bpm; Zs ≈ -0.51 and -0.86), consistent with generally good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic physiological arousal. However, intradaily variability is elevated (IV value 0.73, Z ≈ +1.30), indicating more fragmentation of activity/HR across the day, and interdaily stability is modestly below average (Z ≈ -0.16), indicating only mildly reduced day-to-day regularity. The amplitude of the circadian HR rhythm is slightly reduced (Z ≈ -0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly low (Z ≈ -0.11). These rhythm features suggest that while baseline physiological arousal is low, the participant’s daily activity/HR profile is somewhat more fragmented than typical peers.

Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal HR declines and daytime elevations, with notable relative peaks in late evening hours. Nighttime heart rate deviations are appropriately negative and reach nadirs in early morning hours (e.g., ~-20 bpm around 6–7am). Daytime elevations peak around midday (12–1 pm +15.6 bpm). Two late-evening hours—10–11pm and 11–12am—show relatively large positive deviations from the mesor (10–11pm value Z ≈ +1.65; 11–12am Z ≈ +1.29). Given the participant’s median sleep start time near 01:56 AM, these elevated late-evening HR values likely reflect a phase-shifted/wakeful late-evening period rather than nocturnal sleep. Elevated HR in the late evening can reflect residual arousal, activity, or circadian phase delay; in this case it coheres with self-report of late bedtimes but not with markers of high chronic distress.

Sleep pattern metrics show adequate and consistent sleep duration but a late and relatively stable sleep schedule. Median nightly sleep duration is healthy at about 7 hours 26 minutes (Z ≈ +0.32), and night-to-night variability in duration and sleep start time are lower than population averages (sleep duration SD Z ≈ -0.94; sleep start SD Z ≈ -0.79), indicating regular sleep quantity and consistent timing—albeit timing that is late on average (median start ~01:56). Napping was negligible. Overall, sleep quantity and regularity are not consistent with elevated perceived stress; the principal concern is late sleep timing rather than short or inconsistent sleep.

Integrated interpretation and implication for perceived stress (PSS) placement. The strongest direct predictors of higher PSS in this dataset—higher trait anxiety and depressive symptoms—are low for this participant, which is a primary signal for lower perceived stress. Elevated self-esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction further support placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Wearable signals of concern (intradaily variability, late-evening HR elevations, somewhat reduced circadian amplitude) are present but modest in magnitude and may reflect lifestyle (late-night schedule and high evening social/media engagement) rather than pervasive psychological strain. The isolated, highly elevated recreational-drug Z-score is anomalous in the context of other low symptom reports and therefore should be treated as uncertain without corroboration. Balancing the strong and consistent self-report indicators of low affective symptoms and wellbeing with the modest physiological signals of rhythm fragmentation, the preponderance of evidence favors a perceived stress level in the lower (bottom) half of the study population distribution.

14847,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant endorses elevated affective symptoms that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are above the sample mean (score 24, Z = 1.11; classification: ""Depressed"") and trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86; classification: ""anxious""). Both measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the study (CES-D r = 0.28; STAI r = 0.31), indicating these elevations are likely to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES = 35, Z = -0.45) and current happiness is modestly above average (happy = 4.0, Z = 0.55), but the stronger signal from depressive and anxiety symptomatology points toward increased psychosocial strain.

Sleep and circadian functioning: Subjective and wearable-derived sleep indices indicate disturbed and irregular sleep timing. The participant reports poor sleep quality on the PSQI (score = 10, Z = 1.52; classification: ""Disturbed Sleep""), and Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep is shorter than the cohort median (6h38m, Z = -0.69) with substantial night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 134 minutes, Z = 0.75). Sleep onset is very late (median start ≈ 02:24) with moderate variability (start SD Z = 0.46), and daytime napping is relatively frequent (mean naps/day = 0.24, Z = 1.90). Nonparametric circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (value 0.35, Z = -0.49) and markedly elevated intradaily variability (0.83, Z = 2.01). These circadian irregularities (intradaily variability correlating r = 0.16 with PSS; sleep variability r = 0.14) are consistent with patterns that often accompany higher perceived stress.

Cardiovascular and activity-derived signals: Aggregate heart-rate parameters are broadly within cohort norms for mean level (Mesor ≈ 74.7, Z = 0.10) and resting heart rate (58.4 bpm, Z = 0.03), suggesting no large tonic sympathetic elevation. The cosinor amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude Z = -0.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -0.78), consistent with blunted or less-regular daily HR rhythm. Hourly deviation values show expected nocturnal dips and daytime elevations; several early-morning nadirs (e.g., -22.5 at 5–6am) are present, and small positive correlations between some overnight deviations and PSS (up to r ≈ 0.22) suggest subtle links between nocturnal cardiovascular dynamics and perceived stress in this participant. Overall, physiological rhythms point to preserved resting cardiovascular function but reduced circadian robustness.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07) and substantial social/leisure time (listening to music and socializing both elevated, Z ≈ 1.1 and 0.95). Substance use is minimal. Health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 0.97). These behavioral factors are potential protective influences and may mitigate perceived stress to some extent. However, the combination of late and irregular sleep timing, high nap frequency, and elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms outweigh these protective signals when considering likely perceived stress.

Synthesis and PSS group classification: Evidence for elevated perceived stress (top half) includes above-average depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 1.11), elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.86), poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = 1.52), and pronounced circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = 2.01). Several of these measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the study sample (CES-D r = 0.28; STAI r = 0.31; PSQI and circadian measures showing smaller positive associations), supporting an interpretation of higher perceived stress. Evidence that would support lower or average PSS (bottom half) is weaker: exercise frequency, some social/leisure engagement, and normative resting heart rate provide modest buffering but do not counterbalance the stronger symptom and circadian signals. On balance, the multimodal data converge on a likelihood that this participant’s PSS score falls in the top 50% of the study distribution.

43382,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Psychological symptom profile and self-report indicators:
The participant reports elevated depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 28; Z = 1.53) and above-average trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46). Both scales show positive correlations with PSS in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), indicating that higher scores on these measures are associated with greater perceived stress in the study population. Complementing these risk indicators, the participant’s Rosenberg Self-Esteem score is below the cohort mean (score = 32; Z = -0.87), a trait that is modestly inversely associated with PSS (r ≈ -0.16). In contrast, momentary positive indicators (self-rated happiness and health satisfaction) are relatively high (happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 1.22) and these variables are weakly negatively correlated with PSS, providing some countervailing evidence of positive subjective well‑being despite elevated symptom reports.

Sleep timing and quantity:
Wearable-derived sleep shows a relatively short median nightly sleep duration (6 h 10 min; Z = -1.27) and a late median sleep onset (approximately 01:28), with moderate night-to-night variability in both duration and start time (SDs ~120 and ~101 minutes, Z-scores ~0.4). Shorter sleep and irregular sleep timing are commonly linked to higher perceived stress, though in these data the direct correlation between median sleep duration and PSS is small (r ≈ -0.05), suggesting only a weak direct association in this cohort. The participant’s pattern of late sleep onset combined with limited total sleep hours is nevertheless behaviorally relevant as a potential contributor to perceived strain.

Behavioral and social habits:
The participant reports minimal substance use and low engagement in physical exercise and organized sport (exercise frequencies reflect large negative Z-scores), as well as relatively limited daily socialization and recreational internet or gaming time. Low physical activity and reduced social engagement are factors that can be associated with elevated stress and poorer mood regulation; in this dataset exercise and socializing show small correlations with PSS, so their contribution is likely modest but behaviorally relevant. The participant’s low BMI (17.85) is notable as a health marker but its direct relation to perceived stress is not specified here.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology from wearables:
Cardiac circadian metrics indicate a reasonably coherent 24-hour structure: interdaily stability is slightly higher than average (value 0.45; Z = 0.33) and the autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively elevated (Z = 0.73), consistent with regular day-to-day heart-rate rhythms. Intradaily variability is lower than average (Z = -0.74), implying fewer abrupt within-day fluctuations. These measures—greater regularity and lower fragmentation—are typically associated with lower perceived stress in the cohort (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), which provides physiological evidence leaning slightly toward lower stress. Resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the sample (resting HR Z = 0.62; mesor Z = 1.27), which may reflect higher baseline autonomic arousal; correlations between these measures and PSS are small-to-moderate (resting HR r ≈ 0.14; mesor r ≈ 0.07), offering modest support for greater perceived stress.

Integration and interpretation relative to perceived stress:
Evidence supporting relatively elevated perceived stress (top half of the distribution) includes substantially elevated depressive symptoms and above-average trait anxiety—both variables that correlate positively with PSS—and behavioral markers that may reduce stress-buffering (very low physical activity and limited socializing). Physiological markers present a mixed picture: elevated resting/morning mesor heart rate suggests greater baseline arousal, but circadian regularity (higher interdaily stability and autocorrelation and lower intradaily variability) points toward well-entrained rhythms that are typically associated with lower stress. Subjective positive indicators (higher momentary happiness and health satisfaction) also argue against extreme perceived stress. Overall, the strongest, most robust signals in this profile are the elevated depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety, which more directly and consistently track with higher PSS in this sample than the modest protective signals.

Top vs bottom half judgment:
Considering the relative magnitude and relevance of the available measures—particularly the CES-D and STAI elevations, together with low exercise and short sleep duration—balanced against the weaker protective signals (circadian regularity, higher momentary happiness), the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the top 50% of the study population for perceived stress.

75438,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Summary of self-report psychological profile and behaviors:
The participant’s symptom and trait self-reports indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and a generally resilient psychosocial profile. CES-D score (7, z = -0.66) and STAI–Trait score (36, z = -0.52) are both below the study means, consistent with few depressive symptoms and modest trait anxiety. Rosenberg self-esteem is above average (score 33, z = -0.73) and global health satisfaction is higher than the cohort mean (z = 0.63). The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (≥3×/week) and moderate social engagement (2–3 hours/day), both behaviors that are commonly associated with lower perceived stress. Alcohol use is present at low-to-moderate levels (wine 1–2×/week), recreational/non-prescribed drug use is minimal, and academic performance shows generally above-average GPAs in most semesters. These self-report features collectively point toward resources and behaviors that would typically be associated with lower perceived stress.

Sleep and subjective sleep quality:
Objective sleep from the wearable and subjective sleep quality show mixed signals. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 2 min; z = -1.43), and the PSQI score (6) crosses the common cutoff for “disturbed sleep,” suggesting some subjective sleep difficulties. Sleep timing is late on average (median sleep start ≈ 01:43), with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 66 minutes). There are no recorded daytime naps. Short sleep duration and late, irregular bedtimes can contribute to elevated stress or impair recovery, but the PSQI z-score is only modestly below the cohort mean (z ≈ -0.33) and correlations of these sleep metrics with PSS in this dataset are small. Thus, while sleep may represent a potential vulnerability, it is not a strongly weighted indicator of high perceived stress in the available correlational evidence.

Wearable circadian and cardiovascular indicators:
Heart rate–derived circadian measures show a generally well-entrained daytime activity profile with a low resting heart rate (53 bpm; z = -0.61) and a clear daytime acrophase at mid-afternoon (≈3:28 PM), reflecting an afternoon peak in mean heart rate. Amplitude and mesor are slightly below average but within a modest range. Interdaily stability is lower than the cohort mean (value 0.33; z = -0.66), indicating some day-to-day variability in circadian timing, whereas intradaily variability is also low (z = -1.09), suggesting limited fragmentation within days. Hourly aggregated deviations show expected deep nocturnal reductions in heart rate and substantial positive deviations across midday (strongest around late morning–early afternoon), consistent with active daytime periods. Correlations between these circadian/cardiovascular metrics and PSS are generally small in magnitude; the slightly lower interdaily stability could be a mild risk correlate for higher perceived stress, but the low resting heart rate and structured midday activity are more consistent with lower physiological arousal at rest.

Integration and interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Putting multimodal evidence together, the strongest signals in this profile point toward lower-to-average perceived stress. Low depression and trait anxiety scores, higher self-esteem, active exercise habits, substantive social time, and low resting heart rate are all factors typically associated with lower PSS scores in this cohort. Countervailing signals that could modestly elevate perceived stress include objectively short sleep duration, late sleep timing, and somewhat reduced interdaily circadian stability; however, the associations of these specific features with PSS in the provided correlations are small. Overall, the magnitude and consistency of protective features (low CES-D/STAI, good self-esteem, frequent exercise, social engagement, low resting HR) outweigh the modest sleep/circadian vulnerabilities in predicting perceived stress.

Evidence for low/median versus high PSS:
- Evidence supporting a low or median PSS (bottom 50): Low CES-D and STAI trait scores (both z < 0), higher self-esteem (z < 0 but in direction of better self-regard), high health satisfaction (z = 0.63), frequent exercise and socializing, low resting HR, and overall behavioral patterns that align with protective factors; many of these variables have empirically positive associations with lower PSS in the dataset.  
- Evidence supporting a high PSS (top 50): Short median sleep duration (z = -1.43) and a PSQI > 5 indicating subjective disturbed sleep, plus reduced interdaily stability, which can be associated with greater stress; however, these signals are modest in their correlations with PSS here and are isolated relative to the broader protective profile.

Holistic conclusion:
Balancing the relative magnitudes and directions of the available measures, the participant’s profile is more consistent with perceived stress in the lower half of the study distribution. Protective psychosocial and physiological indicators (notably low depressive and anxiety symptoms, good self-esteem, regular exercise, social engagement, and low resting heart rate) provide stronger and more consistent evidence than the modest sleep and circadian irregularities that could increase stress. Therefore the participant is most likely in the bottom 50% of PSS scores in this study population.

99733,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report profile: The participant reports low affective symptom burden and relatively positive self-appraisals. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D (score = 5, z = -0.86) and trait anxiety on the STAI (score = 31, z = -1.02) are both well below the study mean, and Rosenberg self-esteem is above average (score = 33, z = -0.73). Subjective sleep quality is also favorable (PSQI = 4, z = -1.26), and general health satisfaction is slightly above the sample mean. These survey indicators collectively point toward relatively low psychological distress and adequate perceived functioning during the semester. Correlations between these specific self-report scales and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) are positive but modest (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), suggesting they are related to perceived stress but do not fully determine it.

Behavioral and lifestyle context: The participant reports minimal substance use and limited evening social/leisure time (short durations across TV, gaming, internet, socializing), and engages in solo exercise at a low-to-moderate frequency (1–2 times per week). Academic performance (GPA) is in the typical undergraduate range. Low reported recreational and substance behaviors combined with reasonable health satisfaction and some exercise provide behavioral context consistent with lower perceived stress, or at least with fewer overt coping behaviors that often co-occur with elevated stress.

Sleep and daily schedule from wearables: Objective sleep is somewhat shorter than the study mean (median nightly sleep ≈ 6 hr 43 min, z ≈ -0.58) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 86 min). Median sleep onset is relatively late (≈ 00:38) with moderate variability in sleep start times. Napping is rare. Subjective sleep quality was reported as good (PSQI), so although total sleep time is slightly below average, the participant does not report marked disturbance. Small positive correlations link sleep-timing variability to PSS (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.17), suggesting that irregular sleep timing could modestly contribute to higher perceived stress, but the magnitude is limited.

Circadian and cardiac physiology (wearable-derived): Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate mixed regularity. Interdaily stability is near the sample mean (value = 0.39, z ≈ -0.16) while intradaily variability is elevated (value = 0.70, z ≈ 1.09), consistent with more frequent transitions between activity/rest states across the day (greater rhythm fragmentation). Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is modestly reduced (z ≈ -0.43), and 24-hour autocorrelation is somewhat low, indicating less robust 24-hour rhythmicity. Resting heart rate (62.6 bpm, z ≈ 0.53) and MESOR are slightly above average. The hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal heart rate suppression and a pronounced midday elevation (peak deviations around noon–1pm), consistent with daytime activation and overnight recovery. Several small positive correlations link intradaily variability and resting heart rate with PSS (r ≈ 0.16 and 0.14 respectively), implying these physiological signs of rhythm fragmentation and mild autonomic elevation are modestly associated with higher perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress: Overall, self-report measures and behavioral indicators consistently favor relatively low perceived stress—low depression and anxiety scores, good subjective sleep quality, positive self-esteem, minimal substance use, and reasonable health satisfaction are strong signals toward the lower half of the PSS distribution. Wearable-derived signals introduce some caveats: elevated intradaily variability, slightly blunted circadian amplitude, somewhat higher resting heart rate, and somewhat short but irregular sleep suggest physiological and behavioral irregularities that have small positive associations with PSS. However, these wearable indicators show only modest correlations with perceived stress in this dataset and do not override the stronger self-report pattern. Taking the multimodal evidence together, the preponderance of information supports placement in the lower half of the study population for perceived stress.

27407,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report and symptom indices indicate a mixed profile with features that are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) is above the study mean and shows a positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), suggesting a stable tendency toward anxious responding that often co-occurs with greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is notably poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52), a relatively strong deviation from the study mean; poor PSQI scores are commonly linked to higher PSS. Depressive symptoms are low-to-moderate (CES-D = 13, Z ≈ 0), and self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31), which together suggest that while mood disturbance is not pronounced, there are psychosocial features (anxiety, lower self-esteem, poor subjective sleep) that align with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators present a largely adaptive pattern that can mitigate stress but do not fully counterbalance the subjective symptom indicators. The participant reports regular but modest exercise (sports/exercise 1–2 times per week), very limited substance use, and strong academic performance (GPAs consistently high), which are factors typically associated with resilience and lower perceived stress. Social and recreational time is limited (short durations across many leisure activities), but happiness is reported above average (self-rated happiness Z = 0.55), suggesting some positive affect despite other stress-related signals. Overall, lifestyle data provide mixed evidence—protective behaviors are present but do not eliminate signs of subjective distress.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian metrics indicate high physiological fitness and a coherent circadian organization but also an atypical daily arousal profile. Resting heart rate is low (46.3 bpm, Z = -1.41) and mesor is below the cohort mean (65.2, Z = -1.20), consistent with good aerobic conditioning and lower baseline cardiac load. Nonparametric rhythm measures (interdaily stability ≈ 0.4, intradaily variability ≈ 0.51) are near the cohort center or slightly lower in fragmentation, suggesting relatively regular day-to-day structure and limited circadian fragmentation—factors typically protective against chronic stress. Parametric results show a measurable amplitude and an evening acrophase (~5:46 PM), and hourly mean deviations from mesor reveal pronounced evening heart rate elevations (large positive deviations around 7–9 PM, Zs up to ~2.25) with strong nocturnal reductions. This pattern—low resting tone plus distinct evening arousal peaks—could reflect scheduled evening activity/social or timing of stress-related arousal; several of the wearable metrics correlate modestly with PSS in sample-level analyses, but the physiological profile here overall suggests good cardiac fitness and reasonably stable rhythms.

Objective sleep timing and duration further clarify risk for higher perceived stress. The participant has a late sleep onset (median start ≈ 02:02 AM) and relatively short median sleep duration (≈ 6 h 14 m, Z = -1.17). Sleep timing is fairly consistent night-to-night (start time SD ≈ 51 minutes, Z ≈ -0.71), but total sleep shows moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 120 minutes). Subjectively poor sleep quality (PSQI high) combined with objectively shortened sleep is a convergence of evidence frequently associated with elevated perceived stress and impaired coping. The late chronotype and truncated sleep window can exacerbate daytime fatigue and perceived overwhelm even in the presence of good physical fitness.

Holistic synthesis and PSS group assignment: weighing all modalities, the strongest signals for higher perceived stress are the above-average trait anxiety (STAI), markedly disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), and objectively short, late sleep timing—all of which have established links to higher PSS and are supported by positive sample correlations. Offsetting factors include low resting heart rate, stable circadian regularity, regular (if modest) exercise, limited substance use, and generally high academic functioning and self-rated happiness. On balance, the combination of subjective anxiety and notably poor sleep quality—both of which are robust correlates of perceived stress—outweigh the protective physiological fitness and lifestyle indicators. Therefore the participant is more consistent with the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

43794,26.0,0.927461139896373,"Multimodal self-report profile and behavioral context:
The participant’s self-report data show a mixed picture. Trait anxiety is relatively elevated (STAI trait = 55, Z = +1.35), which is a known correlate of higher perceived stress (study correlation with PSS = 0.31). Depressive symptom burden is low–moderate (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) and classified as “not depressed,” which reduces the likelihood that PSS elevation is driven by concurrent depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem is below the cohort mean (Rosenberg = 32, Z = -0.87), and general health satisfaction is comparatively low (Z = -1.45); both of these features are consistent with greater vulnerability to experiencing stress. Sleep quality by self-report is disturbed (PSQI = 8, Z = +0.59), and alcohol use is modest (wine ~1–2 times/week, Z = +0.94) while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Academic performance appears strong across reported terms (GPAs mostly high), suggesting preserved functioning in the academic domain.

Wearable-derived sleep, activity, and circadian physiology:
Fitbit-derived metrics indicate normal median sleep duration (median = 6h 59m, Z = -0.24) but notable irregularity: high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 156 minutes, Z = +1.25) and a late, variable sleep onset (median start ~01:03, start-time SD = 122 minutes, Z = +0.86). Interdaily stability of heart-rate circadian pattern is low (value = 0.20, Z = -1.73) and amplitude of the circadian rhythm is reduced (amplitude Z = -1.76), indicating a weak and less-regular 24-hour structure in cardiac physiology. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 70.8 bpm, Z = +1.50), while mesor is modestly above average (MESOR Z = +0.41). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations around 5–7am) and daytime elevations, but the overall low amplitude and low day-to-day stability point to attenuated circadian robustness. Intradaily variability is near the cohort mean (value = 0.55, Z = +0.03).

Interpretation of indicators relevant to perceived stress:
Markers that most consistently align with higher perceived stress are present. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z +1.35) is the strongest single self-report predictor here and correlates positively with PSS in the study. Objective physiological indicators tied to stress and autonomic activation—an elevated resting heart rate (RHR Z +1.50) and reduced circadian amplitude/stability (amplitude Z -1.76; interdaily stability Z -1.73)—also point toward greater physiological arousal and circadian irregularity, patterns often observed with higher perceived stress. Sleep is fragmented in timing (late median onset, large start-time SD) and variable across days (high sleep-duration SD), and these sleep irregularities have small positive correlations with PSS in the cohort, supporting the possibility of higher perceived stress. Lower self-esteem and poorer health satisfaction add psychosocial support for elevated stress perception.

Evidence consistent with lower or average perceived stress:
There are some features that argue against very high perceived stress. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D low), and daytime functioning markers such as high GPAs suggest maintained performance under demands. Median nightly sleep duration is close to normative at ~7 hours, and substance use is generally low. Several behavioral leisure measures (e.g., high reported time listening to music) may reflect coping or mood-regulatory activities. Several wearable metrics (e.g., intradaily variability near the cohort mean, some daytime heart-rate deviations not extreme) are not strongly indicative of pathological stress physiology.

Synthesis and conclusion regarding PSS group:
Balancing the multimodal evidence, the participant exhibits multiple converging signals associated with higher perceived stress: notably elevated trait anxiety, objectively higher resting heart rate, diminished circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability, and marked irregularity in sleep timing and duration. Protective signs (low depressive symptoms, preserved academic performance, typical median sleep duration, limited substance use) moderate but do not outweigh the indicators that most directly link to increased perceived stress. Given the strength and consistency of the anxiety and physiological/circadian markers that are empirically correlated with PSS in this sample, the most parsimonious classification is that this participant’s perceived stress is more likely in the upper half of the study distribution.

51437,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report measures indicate a generally low self-reported affective burden and resources consistent with comparatively lower perceived stress. Depressive symptom score (CES-D = 4; Z = -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI = 35; Z = -0.62) are both well below the study mean, and self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.96), each of which would be expected to be associated with lower PSS scores (CES-D and STAI show modest positive correlations with PSS of 0.28 and 0.31 respectively; self-esteem correlates modestly negative with PSS at -0.15). Academic functioning and health satisfaction are also above average (GPA ~3.7; health satisfaction Z = 0.3), and the participant reports frequent solitary exercise and regular sports participation (exercise Zs 1.07 and 1.58), behaviors that are typically protective against perceived stress (exercise correlations with PSS are small and negative). Taken together, the subjective profile and lifestyle indicators provide converging evidence for relatively low perceived stress.

Objective physiological and circadian metrics, however, show signs of physiological arousal and circadian disruption that are more commonly associated with elevated stress. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the study population (RHR = 73 bpm; Z = 1.77) and correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.14). Heart-rate–derived circadian amplitude is low (amplitude Z = -1.59, correlation with PSS r = -0.17), while intradaily variability is elevated (intradaily variability Z = 1.51, correlation with PSS r = 0.16) and interdaily stability is reduced (Z = -0.82). These features—higher fragmented activity within-day, lower day–night amplitude, and reduced stability between days—are consistent with blunted and less regular circadian structure and modestly aligned with higher PSS in the sample correlations. Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show marked elevations late at night (notably a large positive deviation around midnight, 12–1am value Z = 3.91), and elevated heart-rate deviations again before midnight (11–12am Z = 1.52), suggesting nocturnal heart-rate elevations and likely wakefulness or heightened physiological arousal during typical sleep hours.

Sleep behavior is a likely bridge between the subjective and objective signals. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 15 min; Z = -1.16) and the PSQI score indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6; just above the commonly used threshold of 5), yet variability in sleep start time is not unusually large (start-time SD Z = -1.12). The median sleep onset near 2:14 AM indicates a substantially delayed sleep timing. Short, late, and subjectively disturbed sleep coupled with nocturnal heart-rate elevations provides a plausible mechanistic pathway by which physiological stress markers could be elevated despite low reported mood and anxiety: sleep timing and reduced nocturnal recovery can increase resting heart rate and intradaily instability even in people who do not endorse high distress on depression/anxiety scales.

Integrative interpretation for perceived stress: subjective self-report instruments that most directly tap perceived mood and chronic anxiety are consistently below sample averages and point toward lower perceived stress (these instruments historically align closely with PSS scores). Objective wearable signals show physiological features that modestly align with higher stress (higher RHR, circadian fragmentation, nocturnal arousal), but the magnitudes of the correlations between these wearable features and PSS in the study are small to moderate (r approximately 0.1–0.2). Given that PSS measures perceived stress and the participant’s self-report profile (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, active exercise habits, good academic performance) provides stronger direct evidence of low perceived stress, the balance of evidence favors a PSS level in the lower half of the study distribution. The objective signs of physiological arousal and disturbed sleep suggest areas for monitoring or behavioral intervention (sleep timing and nocturnal recovery) but do not outweigh the consistent self-report indicators of relatively low perceived stress.

21932,13.0,0.023316062176165803,"Psychological trait and symptom measures point toward relatively low perceived distress in this participant. Self-report depression (CES-D = 4, z ≈ -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI = 28, z ≈ -1.31) are well below the study mean, indicating limited current depressive symptoms and low chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES z = 1.66), and academic performance is high (GPAs near 4.0), both of which are generally associated with greater perceived coping resources and lower perceived stress. These self-report indicators collectively constitute strong evidence consistent with the participant falling in the lower half of the PSS distribution.

Objective sleep and subjective sleep reports diverge in ways that are informative for stress interpretation. Fitbit-derived sleep shows long and relatively stable sleep duration (median 8 h 14 m, z = 1.31; duration SD ~50 min, z = -1.15) and a moderately consistent sleep start time (median start ≈ 00:38, start-time SD ≈ 55 min, z = -0.61). In contrast, the PSQI score is 8 (z ≈ 0.59), crossing the common threshold for disturbed sleep and indicating the participant perceives sleep difficulties. This pattern — objectively adequate and regular sleep duration but subjectively reported poor sleep quality — can reflect non-sleep-related contributors to perceived sleep disturbance (e.g., minor sleep fragmentation, worry, or sleep perception biases). The weak correlation between median sleep duration and PSS (r ≈ -0.03) suggests sleep length alone is not strongly linked to perceived stress for this person, but subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) is a signal that may modestly elevate perceived stress relative to objective indicators.

Cardiovascular and circadian measures indicate generally healthy basal physiology with some circadian fragmentation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.1 bpm, z ≈ -0.48) and MESOR is slightly below the study mean (69.7 bpm, z ≈ -0.58), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic arousal. Cosinor amplitude is modestly above average (amplitude z = 0.44) and acrophase around mid-to-late afternoon (≈ 5:20 PM), indicating a pronounced daytime rise in heart rate. Nonparametric circadian metrics show moderate interdaily stability (0.49, z ≈ 0.67) but elevated intradaily variability (0.68, z ≈ 0.95), which reflects more frequent within-day transitions between activity and rest states. Intradaily variability correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.17), and several early-morning hourly deviations (e.g., 4–7 AM) show small positive correlations with PSS. These findings suggest that although baseline cardiovascular tone is low, greater within-day rhythm fragmentation and some early-morning heart rate patterns are the wearable-derived features most associated with higher perceived stress in this case.

Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations emphasize distinct daytime and late-evening peaks. The largest positive deviations from mesor occur at midday (12–2 PM, with z-scores >2) and at 10–11 PM (z ≈ 3.14), while the deepest negative deviations occur across the pre-dawn hours (roughly 2–7 AM). The large evening deviation at 10–11 PM is notable; despite the participant’s objectively long sleep, a pronounced late-evening heart rate elevation could reflect late-evening activity, arousal, or episodic physiological activation. Importantly, many of the large daytime and evening positive deviations correlate negatively (or near-zero) with PSS, whereas some early-morning negative deviations correlate modestly positively with PSS. Overall, these aggregated hourly patterns indicate clear daily structure with pockets of heightened evening and midday arousal, but they do not uniformly map onto higher perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators further tilt the balance toward lower perceived stress. The participant reports low substance use, modest and regular exercise (mostly 1–2 times per week), limited sedentary recreational habits (many “do not do” responses), and above-average health satisfaction (z ≈ 0.55). Combined with high academic performance and limited substance use, these behaviors are consistent with protective factors against elevated perceived stress. Conversely, the subjective report of disturbed sleep (PSQI >5) and the elevated intradaily variability are the primary pieces of evidence that could point to higher perceived stress, but both signals are modest in magnitude and partially offset by other indicators of well-being.

Evidence for a low/median PSS score (bottom 50): strong. Low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, high self-esteem, low resting heart rate, stable and long sleep duration, high GPA, low substance use, and generally healthy lifestyle behaviors are all consistent with lower perceived stress and suggest placement in the bottom half of the PSS distribution. Evidence for a high PSS score (top 50): limited and modest. The participant’s PSQI indicates subjective sleep disturbance and intradaily variability and some early-morning heart-rate deviations show small positive correlations with PSS; these are the main wearable/self-report signals associated with higher perceived stress but are relatively small in magnitude and inconsistent across other domains.

Holistic conclusion: weighing the strong and convergent indicators of low depressive and anxiety symptoms, elevated self-esteem, good objective cardiovascular and sleep quantity metrics, and adaptive lifestyle behaviors against the modest signals of subjective sleep disturbance and circadian fragmentation, the preponderance of evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study population’s perceived stress distribution.

36385,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Psychological symptom profile and self-report indicators:
The participant reports elevated internalizing symptomatology relative to the study sample. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29, Z = +1.63) are well above the sample mean, and trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = +0.76) is moderately elevated. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 31, Z = −1.01). Together these self-report indices show a cluster of higher negative affect and lower self-regard; both depressive symptoms and trait anxiety have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), indicating these features tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) meets a common threshold for disturbed sleep, though its z-score is only slightly below average (Z ≈ −0.33), and current self-reported happiness is modestly above average (Z ≈ +0.55), suggesting some mixed subjective well-being signals alongside the symptom elevation.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian patterns:
Cardiovascular and circadian metrics indicate generally preserved diurnal structure with some markers of increased physiological activation. Resting heart rate is moderately elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 64.05 bpm, Z = +0.70), and the cosinor MESOR is slightly above average (MESOR Z = +0.41). Non-parametric circadian metrics are in an average-to-slightly-more-regular range (interdaily stability 0.44, Z = +0.25; intradaily variability 0.56, Z = +0.10), so the participant shows a coherent daily rhythm without marked flattening. Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected night-time reductions (large negative deviations overnight) and daytime/evening elevations, with the largest positive deviations in the evening (e.g., ~7–10 pm), consistent with typical behavioral activation patterns. Several early-morning hourly deviations (around 3–6 am) show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample, and resting HR and some circadian variability measures have weak positive associations with perceived stress; collectively this points to low-to-moderate physiological arousal that can accompany elevated stress but is not extreme.

Sleep timing, quantity, and variability:
Fitbit-derived sleep quantity is high relative to peers (median nightly sleep ≈ 8 h 47 min, Z = +2.0), but sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep start ≈ 00:54, sleep start SD ≈ 140 minutes, Z = +1.26). Night-to-night variability in sleep onset and moderately elevated sleep-duration variability (sleep SD Z ≈ +0.73) suggest irregular schedules. In the context of elevated depressive symptoms, comparatively long sleep duration plus variable sleep timing can reflect compensatory sleep or dysregulated sleep–wake timing; importantly, greater sleep-timing variability has a small positive correlation with PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.17), indicating this pattern tends to accompany higher perceived stress.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle context:
Behavioral data show moderate social and recreational engagement (listening to music high, socializing ~1–2 hours/day, exercise 1–2× per week) and restrained substance use (occasional alcohol, no recreational/non-prescribed drug use). Academic performance is strong (multiple GPA values ≥3.5), suggesting preserved functioning in achievement domains. Health satisfaction is somewhat lower than average (Z ≈ −0.70), which could reflect health-related concerns contributing to stress appraisal. Overall, behavioral coping resources (socializing, exercise) are present but modest in frequency; high engagement with music may serve as a coping behavior.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress (PSS):
The overall profile combines moderately-to-substantially elevated affective symptom burden (notably CES-D and STAI), lower self-esteem, moderately elevated resting cardiovascular tone, and irregular sleep timing—features that in the present sample are associated with higher perceived stress. Several individual metrics that correlate positively with PSS (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, sleep-timing variability, modestly elevated resting HR and intradaily variability) point toward greater perceived stress rather than low/average stress. Protective or mitigating signals (long total sleep duration, some social/recreational engagement, preserved circadian structure, and high academic performance) are present but do not fully counterbalance the symptom cluster. Taken holistically, the pattern is more consistent with the participant falling in the upper half of the sample distribution for perceived stress.

54030,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Self-report profile and psychological symptom indicators:
The participant’s self-reported symptom and trait measures point to relatively low psychological distress and positive self-appraisals. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI = 27, Z = -1.41) are well below the study mean, indicating infrequent depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with peers. Concurrently, measures of self-esteem (Rosenberg, Z = 1.52) and current happiness (Z = 1.64) are substantially higher than average, and health satisfaction is modestly above the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.72). Substance use is essentially absent and social activity and sports participation are at or above typical levels, which together suggest engagement in socially supportive and health-promoting behaviors. Taken together, the pattern of low internalizing symptoms and elevated positive affect/self-regard is most consistent with relatively low perceived stress on subjective measures.

Wearable-derived circadian and variability metrics:
Physiological circadian metrics show a mixed picture of low rhythmic amplitude and poor day-to-day stability. The cosinor amplitude (Z = -1.29) and mesor (Z = -0.73) are below average, while interdaily stability (Z = -1.07) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = -1.20) are also reduced, indicating that the heart rate rhythm is lower in amplitude and less consistent across days than typical for the sample. Intradaily variability is high (IV value 0.88, Z = 2.36), indicating relatively frequent and abrupt transitions between activity/rest states within days (greater fragmentation). These features—dampened amplitude combined with elevated within-day fragmentation and reduced day-to-day regularity—suggest circadian irregularity and more variable behavioral/physiological state transitions, which can reflect irregular sleep/wake patterns or variable daily schedules rather than chronic subjective distress per se.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Wearable sleep metrics indicate late and irregular sleep timing with shorter-than-average nightly sleep. Median bedtime (sleep start) is very late (~02:56 AM), with a median sleep duration of about 6 hours 18 minutes (Z = -1.09), and a relatively large night-to-night duration standard deviation (~143 minutes, Z ≈ 0.96). Nap frequency is somewhat elevated (mean daily naps 0.22, Z = 1.75). The PSQI score (5.0, Z ≈ -0.8) is at the customary cutoff between “good” and disturbed subjective sleep, suggesting the participant subjectively rates sleep as generally acceptable even though objective metrics show short, late, and variable sleep. Late sleep timing and variable duration align with the circadian irregularity seen in heart rate-derived measures; these patterns are often associated with lifestyle or scheduling factors (e.g., evening activities, irregular social/academic timing) and can be independent from current perceived stress.

Hourly heart rate deviations and evening arousal:
The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal dips (notable negative deviations across 1–8 AM) and daytime elevations, but with a relatively large positive deviation at 10–11 PM (Value = 14.19, Z = 1.22). Resting heart rate is near-sample-average/low (58.4 bpm, Z ≈ 0.03) and mesor is slightly below average, indicating no generalized elevation of baseline cardiovascular arousal. The elevated relative heart rate in the late evening window suggests episodic evening physiological activation (which could reflect social activity, screen exposure, or late-day stimulants) that coincides with the participant’s late sleep onset. Overall, heart rate data do not show sustained hyperarousal across the day but do reflect temporal shifts toward later-evening activation.

Integration with perceived stress (PSS) implications:
When integrating subjective and objective data, self-report indicators (markedly low depressive and anxiety symptoms, elevated self-esteem and happiness, minimal substance use, and adequate social engagement) strongly favor a lower perceived stress level relative to the study sample. Wearable signals indicate circadian irregularity and short, variable sleep with some evening physiological activation—features that can be associated with elevated stress in some contexts but here appear more coherent with late-night habits and schedule irregularity rather than parallel subjective distress (given the low symptom scores and positive affect). Correlations provided in the dataset between many of these wearable features and PSS are modest in magnitude, reducing confidence that the physiological irregularities necessarily reflect higher perceived stress for this person. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (especially the robustly low STAI and CES-D and high well-being scores) indicates this participant’s perceived stress is likely in the lower half of the study distribution.

34062,26.0,0.927461139896373,"Self-report data indicate a generally low burden of internalizing symptoms and protective psychosocial resources. The participant’s CES-D (7) and STAI-Trait (36) scores are both below the study mean (negative z-scores), suggesting relatively few depressive symptoms and lower trait anxiety compared with peers. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (self-esteem z = 1.38; happiness z = 1.64), and self-rated health satisfaction is high (z = 1.8). Together these measures point to a profile characterized by greater perceived self-efficacy and positive affect, features that are commonly associated with lower perceived stress in student samples.

Subjective sleep quality diverges from the objective sleep duration recorded by the wearable. The participant reports poor sleep on the PSQI (score = 10, z = 1.52), indicating experienced sleep disturbance, whereas Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours and 6 minutes (near the cohort mean, z ≈ -0.11). Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is moderate (sleep start SD ≈ 95 minutes; duration SD ≈ 80 minutes). This pattern—adequate average sleep time but higher subjective disturbance and some variability in start times—suggests sleep-related complaints that may reflect sleep fragmentation, non-restorative sleep, or sleep-related worry not fully captured by duration alone. Importantly, PSQI elevations typically correlate with perceived stress, so subjective sleep problems are a relevant indicator of stress-related experience even when objective sleep quantity appears sufficient.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular features show a mix of orderly and atypical elements. Resting heart rate and overall mesor are low for the sample (resting HR = 45.7 bpm, mesor z ≈ -2.08), a pattern commonly seen in physically fit individuals and consistent with the participant’s frequent exercise report. Amplitude is slightly lower than average (z ≈ -0.4) and interdaily stability is somewhat reduced (z ≈ -0.41), while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (z ≈ 0.17). These signs indicate lower mean cardiovascular tone with somewhat less regular day-to-day circadian structure and somewhat greater fragmentation within days. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected large nocturnal decreases in heart rate and pronounced morning and early evening peaks (notably 7–9 AM and 5–7 PM with high positive z-scores), consistent with routine daytime activity bursts. A small number of early-morning hours (3–6 AM) show stronger negative deviations with small positive correlations to PSS, suggesting that lower overnight cardiovascular tone at those hours was modestly associated with higher perceived stress across the sample; however, these correlations are small and the participant’s overall low resting HR argues more for fitness than stress-related hyperarousal.

Lifestyle and behavioral indicators generally support lower perceived stress. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more) and moderate socializing (1–2 hours), both of which are protective factors for stress. Alcohol use is moderate (beer/wine 1–2 times per week) and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use is reported. Engagement in sedentary hobbies and reading is low, but this appears to coexist with active routines and positive subjective well-being. These behavioral patterns, together with low depression/anxiety scores and a low resting heart rate, argue for adaptive coping and physical fitness rather than chronic stress-driven behavior.

Holistic integration of the multimodal evidence points toward a relatively low-to-average perceived stress level for this participant. Key contributors to this conclusion are the low depression and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise and low resting heart rate, and only modest objective sleep deficits. Countervailing indicators—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10) and some reduction in circadian regularity—signal that the participant does experience sleep-related difficulties and some rhythm fragmentation, which can be linked to stress, but these factors are not accompanied by elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, or physiological hyperarousal that typically align with higher PSS scores. Given the pattern and the small-to-moderate correlations between several markers and PSS in the cohort, the overall balance of evidence is consistent with the participant having a PSS score at or below the study median.

18111,28.0,0.961139896373057,"Self-report instruments indicate elevated negative affect and symptom burden that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score (27; Z = 1.42) is well above the sample mean and classified in the range suggesting notable depressive symptoms; trait anxiety on the STAI is also elevated (48; Z = 0.66). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8; Z = 0.59) and current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0; Z = -1.61). Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES Z = -0.31) and health satisfaction is modestly lower than typical (Z = -0.53). Together, these self-report indicators (particularly depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, which correlate positively with PSS in this dataset) point toward a psychological profile that often co-occurs with increased perceived stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show a pattern of behavioral irregularity rather than chronic sleep deprivation. Median nightly sleep duration is within a typical range (7 h 16 m; Z = 0.10), but night-to-night variability is elevated (SD = 113 min; Z = 0.27) and median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:20 AM). The participant also records more frequent napping than most peers (mean daily naps 0.27; Z = 2.27). These features — a late and variable sleep schedule plus frequent naps — are consistent with irregular sleep timing and compensatory daytime sleep, conditions that can amplify subjective stress and are aligned with the elevated PSQI score.

Circadian and heart-rate-derived rhythm measures further support a picture of reduced temporal organization of physiology. Interdaily stability (0.24; Z = -1.4) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.21; Z = -0.95) are low, and cosinor-derived amplitude is attenuated (6.21; Z = -1.48), indicating a blunted and less regular heart rate rhythm across days. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.58; Z = 0.24), suggesting more fragmentation within days. Resting heart rate is within typical limits (58.2 bpm; Z ≈ 0.01), but aggregate hourly deviations show pronounced evening and late-evening heart rate elevations (largest positive deviations around 8–9 pm and 9–10 pm; Zs up to 1.85), together with marked nocturnal declines — a pattern compatible with physiological arousal concentrated later in the day and consolidated recovery at night. Reduced circadian stability and blunted amplitude are features that have modest negative correlations with wellbeing measures and, in this sample, are plausibly associated with greater perceived stress.

Behavioral context and lifestyle features add supporting evidence toward elevated perceived stress. The participant reports modest social and recreational engagement (socializing 1–2 hours; increased internet use 2–3 hours) and low participation in sports, with alcohol use at a weekly frequency. These behaviors, when combined with elevated depressive and anxiety scores and irregular sleep/circadian patterns, align with risk profiles for higher perceived stress in university samples. Correlations provided in the dataset show that depressive symptoms and trait anxiety have the strongest positive associations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and several objective rhythm measures (e.g., lower amplitude, lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability) have small-to-moderate relationships in the expected directions.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: elevated depressive symptomatology and trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, low positive affect, late and irregular sleep timing with frequent naps, plus objective markers of circadian blunting and day-to-day irregularity together form a consistent signal associated with higher perceived stress. Although some measures (median sleep duration, resting heart rate) are within normative bounds, the balance of self-report and wearable indicators — particularly those that show moderate correlations with PSS in this sample — support classification in the upper half of the study population for perceived stress.

59097,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report measures indicate notable affective symptom burden that is commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score of 28 (Z = 1.53) is well above the sample mean and classified as “depressed,” and the trait anxiety score (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) is above average; both scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is slightly below the sample mean (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31) and current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61), with happiness negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.19). Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59) also signals greater sleep-related complaints; collectively these self-report indicators point toward a psychological profile that typically co-occurs with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle data present a mixed pattern. Alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ +1) is somewhat above average for the sample, while recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise frequency is low for solo and group exercise (1–2 times a month) but engagement in sports is relatively higher (1–2 times a week, Z = 0.91). Socializing time is higher than average (2–3 hours daily, Z = 0.95), which can be a protective behavioral resource. Trust and health-satisfaction scores are slightly below/near average. These behavioral features offer both potential stress-amplifying elements (regular alcohol use, low routine exercise) and possible buffers (frequent socializing, organized sports participation), but their correlations with PSS in this dataset are modest.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics indicate a relatively strong and regular daily physiological rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.23) are high while intradaily variability is low (0.33, Z = -1.52), a combination that reflects consistent day-to-day structure and low fragmentation of heart-rate activity. Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is elevated (14.74, Z = 1.28), and the aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced overnight trough and clear daytime elevations centered in the afternoon-evening (acrophase ~4:49 PM). Resting heart rate is near sample average (≈58.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.05). In this cohort these circadian stability and amplitude markers tend to associate weakly with lower PSS (small negative correlations), suggesting that the participant’s structured rhythm and clear daytime activation are physiologically resilient features that could mitigate perceived stress.

Sleep from the wearable shows long and regular objective duration but late timing and a subjective quality mismatch. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 hr 23 min, Z = 1.5) with low night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ -0.99; sleep duration SD Z ≈ -0.62) and no naps recorded. However, the median sleep start time is late (≈1:07 AM) and the PSQI indicates disturbed subjective sleep. This pattern—adequate objective time asleep but late timing and self-reported poor sleep quality—can contribute to fatigue or poor daytime functioning in ways that correlate with higher perceived stress, even when objective duration appears sufficient.

Integrated interpretation and PSS placement: affective symptomatology (elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety) and subjective reports of poor sleep constitute the strongest indicators that the participant experiences elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample; these measures also have the largest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset. Wearable signals (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, pronounced amplitude, and near-average resting HR) are notable protective features that point to behavioral and physiological regularity and may reduce stress vulnerability, but their correlations with PSS are smaller in magnitude. On balance—given the sizable positive affective symptom burden, low self-reported happiness, and subjective sleep disturbance combined with only modest protective wearable signals—the overall evidence favors placement in the higher half of the PSS distribution (top 50%) within this study population.

24833,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report indicators point toward relatively low-to-average perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score (10; z = -0.34) and trait anxiety (STAI = 33; z = -0.82) are both below the study mean, and self-esteem is relatively elevated (RSES z = 0.82). Health satisfaction is higher than average (z = 0.8). Leisure and social behaviors are modestly engaged (socializing 1–2 hours/day; listening to music 1–2 hours) and substance use is present at a weekly level but not extreme. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7) is in the “disturbed” range nominally, but its z-score is close to the population mean (z = 0.13). Taken together, these self-report measures—particularly reduced trait anxiety and depressive symptoms alongside higher self-esteem—generally align with lower perceived stress relative to the sample.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics present a more mixed picture that could reflect behavioral irregularity with modest physiological arousal. Circadian regularity (interdaily stability) is substantially lower than the sample average (value 0.17; z = -1.98) and 24-hour autocorrelation is also low (z = -1.79), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (z = 0.46). Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (z = -1.58). These features indicate a less stable, more fragmented heart-rate rhythm across days. Resting heart rate is somewhat higher than average (64.7 bpm; z = 0.78), which—together with the modestly increased intradaily variability—can reflect greater tonic autonomic activation or recent behavioral arousal. Correlations between these wearable metrics and PSS in the study are small (generally |r| < 0.2), so while the pattern of circadian disruption and elevated resting HR has been linked with stress in prior work, the effect sizes here are modest.

Sleep timing and quantity provide additional context relevant to perceived stress. Objective median sleep duration is slightly below sample average (6 h 55 m; z = -0.32) and the participant’s median sleep start time is late (approximately 2:10 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 85 minutes). Nighttime heart-rate deviations show the expected overnight decline but indicate relatively late timing of activity/arousal relative to typical diurnal schedules (acrophase ~5:40 PM, reduced amplitude). Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI >5) together with late and variable bedtimes suggests potential sleep timing disruption that can contribute to perceived stress and daytime dysregulation, though again the magnitude of associations with PSS in the sample is small.

Integrative interpretation for perceived stress: self-report trait measures (low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, higher self-esteem, good health satisfaction) provide the strongest evidence that this participant reports lower perceived stress relative to the study population. Wearable signals—reduced interdaily stability, reduced circadian amplitude, slightly elevated intradaily variability, late and variable sleep timing, and modestly elevated resting heart rate—suggest behavioral circadian irregularity and mild physiological activation that are often associated with greater stress. However, the wearable correlates have relatively small effect sizes with PSS in this dataset, and only some wearable features are pronounced (notably interdaily stability). Weighing self-report and physiological data holistically, the balance of evidence favors placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution: the participant’s trait psychological profile strongly indicates lower perceived stress, while the physiological/circadian markers provide cautionary but not decisive evidence for elevated stress.

Conclusion
On balance—taking stronger weight from the participant’s low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, and higher self-esteem alongside weaker, modest wearable indicators of circadian irregularity—the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom 50% of the study population on the Perceived Stress Scale.

84502,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures present a mixed but overall moderate profile with respect to indicators commonly associated with perceived stress. The participant reports elevated symptoms of depression on the CES-D (score = 18; Z = 0.49), and substantially disturbed subjective sleep on the PSQI (score = 10; Z = 1.52). Current self-rated happiness is below the sample mean (Z = -0.53). At the same time, trait anxiety is slightly below the sample mean (STAI = 38; Z = -0.33), self-esteem is above average (RSES Z = 0.40), and satisfaction with physical health is relatively high (Z = 0.72). Behavioral self-reports indicate limited substance use, frequent social exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23), and moderate internet and socializing time. Taken together, the self-report profile suggests some affective symptoms and perceived sleep problems that could increase perceived stress, but also personal resources (lower trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, good health satisfaction, social exercise, low substance use) that typically buffer stress perception.

Objective wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics largely indicate regularity and adequate duration rather than the patterns typically associated with high perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 31 minutes (Z = 0.41) with modest night-to-night variability, and mean daily naps are absent (Z = -0.86). Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms is relatively high (value = 0.55; Z = 1.16) and 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z = 0.81), indicating a well-structured daily pattern across the recording period. Intradaily variability is near the population average (Z = 0.03). These circadian features (greater stability and autocorrelation) are correlated modestly with lower PSS in the sample, which suggests the participant’s regular rhythms are likely protective against higher perceived stress.

Cardiovascular indicators reflect relatively low baseline arousal and clear daily structure, with some pronounced daytime peaks consistent with activity schedules. Resting heart rate is low (52.6 bpm; Z = -0.66) and overall mesor is below average (Z = -0.94), both consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic physiological arousal. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is slightly above average (Z = 0.53) and acrophase is in the mid-afternoon. Hourly aggregated deviations show strong negative deviations overnight and large positive deviations in the late afternoon to early evening (notably 4–6 pm with Z-scores >2), consistent with typical daytime activity rather than sustained physiological hyperarousal. Correlations between many of these wearable circadian/activity features and PSS are small and generally in the direction that higher regularity and stronger daily amplitude are associated with lower PSS.

Weighing the evidence for placement in the population distribution of perceived stress: indicators that would support higher PSS (moderate depressive symptoms on CES-D and notably poor subjective sleep on PSQI) are present but of modest magnitude relative to the sample (CES-D Z ≈ 0.5; PSQI Z ≈ 1.5). Countervailing evidence for lower or average perceived stress is relatively strong: lower trait anxiety, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction, low resting HR, regular circadian rhythms (high interdaily stability and autocorrelation), absence of substance use, consistent sleep duration, and frequent social exercise. Many of these protective features are specifically associated with lower PSS in the sample correlations and have Z-scores indicating above-average resilience. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with a perceived stress level at or below the sample median rather than in the top half of the distribution.

78783,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures show a mixed profile with several features that conventionally relate to elevated perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) is modestly above the study mean and has a positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), indicating a tendency toward greater chronic anxiety that would be expected to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are near the sample mean (score = 13, Z ≈ 0), whereas self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11), which are mitigating influences. However, current self-rated happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61) and health satisfaction is below average (Z ≈ -1.11); both of these subjective well-being indicators tend to track inversely with perceived stress and therefore point toward elevated stress burden for this participant.

Sleep-related self-report and objective sleep metrics converge on disturbed and irregular sleep, a domain strongly related to perceived stress. The PSQI score of 8 indicates clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance (Z = 0.59). Fitbit-derived sleep shows a late median sleep onset (≈ 02:51 AM), a median nightly duration just under 7 hours (6 h 52 min, Z = -0.39), and marked night-to-night variability in both sleep duration (SD ≈ 151 min, Z = 1.13) and sleep-start times (SD ≈ 173 min, Z = 1.99). The participant also has an elevated rate of daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.26, Z = 2.23). These objective sleep irregularities and late timing are commonly associated with higher perceived stress and are consistent with the participant’s self-reported poor sleep quality.

Cardiovascular and circadian-derived wearable metrics indicate a well-conditioned resting cardiovascular profile but a fragmented circadian structure in activity/heart rate. Resting heart rate is relatively low (≈ 52.8 bpm, Z = -0.64) and mesor is below the sample mean (mesor ≈ 69.7, Z = -0.58), which generally reflect good cardiovascular fitness and are protective against stress-related morbidity. At the same time, non-parametric circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (value = 0.36, Z = -0.41) and mildly elevated intradaily variability (value = 0.58, Z = 0.24), consistent with day-to-day irregularity and fragmentation of daily rhythm. Cosinor-derived amplitude is slightly elevated (Z ≈ 0.49) with an acrophase in the early evening (≈ 6:24 PM), and aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal dips and marked evening peaks — a profile aligning with late sleep timing and pronounced arousal/activity in the evening. The circadian irregularity measures have small correlations with PSS in this dataset (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), but the overall pattern (late timing + irregularity) tends to accompany higher perceived stress in young adults.

Behavioral and social factors present both protective and risk elements. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (≥ three times/week; Z = 1.07) and substantial socializing time (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95), each of which are commonly associated with lower perceived stress. Substance use is low to moderate, and recreational drug use is absent. Conversely, low happiness and poor subjective health, along with large fluctuations in sleep timing and increased daytime napping, are behavioral signals typically linked to higher perceived stress. Correlational patterns in the dataset (e.g., positive correlations between sleep variability and PSS, and between trait anxiety and PSS) reinforce the interpretation that the sleep/circadian irregularities and anxiety proneness are relevant contributors to perceived stress for this participant.

Integrative interpretation and PSS-group classification: weighing the available evidence, the participant shows several indicators that tilt toward elevated perceived stress: modestly higher trait anxiety (STAI), subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI), objectively late and irregular sleep timing with frequent napping, low current happiness, and reduced health satisfaction. Offsetting factors include relatively high exercise frequency, above-average socializing, high self-esteem, and a low resting heart rate. On balance, the pattern of affective (low happiness), anxiety-proneness, and pronounced sleep/circadian irregularity provides stronger evidence for placement above the median PSS in this sample. Therefore, the participant is more consistent with the top half of the study population on perceived stress.

25197,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Psychological self-report and trait measures indicate a mixed profile with several signals that point toward elevated perceived stress. The participant reports a relatively high trait anxiety score (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) — one of the strongest survey-level correlates of PSS in the study (correlation ≈ 0.31) — suggesting a greater propensity to experience and report feelings of anxiety and stress. Current depressive symptoms are low–moderate (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) and thus do not strongly push toward higher perceived stress in this case, while self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.82), a factor that is inversely associated with PSS (corr ≈ -0.16) and would be expected to buffer stress perception. Self-rated happiness is lower than average (Current happiness Z = -0.53), and subjective sleep quality is impaired (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep), both of which are modestly consistent with higher perceived stress in the sample. Alcohol use at the reported frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week) is above average for this cohort (Z ≈ 1.0) but shows negligible correlation with PSS in the study. In sum, trait anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep are the strongest self-report indicators that would point toward elevated perceived stress, while higher self-esteem provides partial counterweight.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology provide additional, largely non-conflicting information. Nighttime heart rate deviations show pronounced reductions overnight and a low resting heart rate (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68), consistent with relatively low basal physiological arousal; these physiological features have only small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (resting HR corr ≈ 0.14). Circadian rhythm analysis shows a relatively large amplitude (Z = 0.64) and reasonably stable day-to-day structure (interdaily stability near average, Z = 0.09; intradaily variability lower than average, Z = -0.53). Higher amplitude and lower intradaily fragmentation are associated with slightly lower perceived stress in the cohort (correlations ≈ -0.17 and +0.16 respectively), so the participant’s stronger amplitude and lower fragmentation are features consistent with lower or average perceived stress. Objective sleep duration is slightly below the sample mean (median 6 h 34 min, Z = -0.77) with low nap frequency and relatively consistent sleep start times (median start ≈ 01:45 AM, SD ~56 min, Zs modestly negative), a pattern that signals shorter and later nocturnal sleep but regularity across nights. The subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) combined with objectively shorter, late sleep could contribute to higher perceived stress, whereas the preserved circadian amplitude and low fragmentation point toward resilient behavioral-physiological structure.

Weighing evidence across modalities yields a mixed but asymmetric picture: the strongest predictors of higher PSS in this participant are elevated trait anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep coupled with lower self-reported happiness. Countervailing signals include high self-esteem, high health satisfaction, low resting heart rate, high circadian amplitude, and low intradaily variability — features that in the cohort are modestly associated with lower or average PSS. Because trait anxiety (STAI) is among the most strongly correlated predictors of PSS in this dataset and is meaningfully elevated here (Z ≈ 0.86), and because subjective sleep disturbance and lower happiness also align with higher stress, the overall balance of evidence favors the participant having perceived stress in the upper half of the study distribution. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall into the top 50% of PSS scores rather than the bottom 50%.

Trait anxiety is elevated relative to the study sample (STAI–Trait = 47; Z = 0.56), indicating greater anxiety proneness that is moderately positively associated with higher PSS in this cohort (correlation ≈ 0.31). Subjective well-being and health indices are generally positive: current happiness and health satisfaction both sit above the sample mean (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.55). Together, these self-reports indicate some chronic anxiety proneness but otherwise a psychological profile characterized by low depressive symptoms, preserved self-regard, and above-average subjective health and happiness.

Lifestyle and behavioral indicators: The participant endorses frequent physical activity (sports three times weekly or more, Z = 1.58; exercise alone three times weekly or more, Z = 1.07) and minimal substance use (alcohol and drugs reported as “not at all,” with Z-scores well below the sample mean). Academic performance is strong (GPAs near 4.0) and body mass index is in a healthy range. Socialization time is low (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41), and many sedentary leisure activities are absent; these indicate a relatively active, structured schedule with limited time spent in social or sedentary recreational pursuits. High physical activity and low substance use are generally protective against perceived stress, whereas limited social contact could reduce an available buffer against stressors.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian patterns: Nighttime cardiac suppression is pronounced (aggregate deviations from mesor −15 to −19 bpm across late-night hours; strongly negative Z-scores), and resting heart rate is lower than the sample average (RHR = 54.9 bpm; Z = -0.39), consistent with good baseline cardiovascular fitness or parasympathetic tone. Sleep objectively appears long and regular: median nightly sleep ≈ 8 h 49 min (Z = 2.03) with good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4; Z = -1.26). Circadian regularity metrics are mixed—interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z = -0.24) while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z = 0.39), indicating somewhat greater fragmentation of day–night activity patterns. Prominent daytime heart-rate elevations are observed in the mid-morning and midday windows (e.g., 9–11am deviations Z > 1.9–2.1), which may reflect routine periods of activity, arousal, or task-related engagement. Correlations between several wearable indices and PSS are small in magnitude; intradaily variability and early-morning HR deviations show weak positive associations with PSS (r ≈ 0.16–0.21), while many nighttime deviations correlate weakly and negatively with PSS.

Integrated interpretation with respect to perceived stress (PSS): Evidence for higher perceived stress is primarily the moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and small positive correlations between some disruption/fragmentation indicators (intradaily variability, morning HR reactivity) and PSS. By contrast, multiple protective signals point toward lower or average perceived stress: low depressive symptoms, good subjective and objective sleep (long duration and low PSQI), regular exercise, low substance use, low resting heart rate, and above-average self-reported happiness and health satisfaction. The limited social time is a potential risk factor but is counterbalanced by other strengths (exercise, sleep, academic functioning). Overall, the balance of convergent data (strong sleep, high activity, low depressive symptoms, low substance use, and only modest physiological fragmentation) suggests the participant’s perceived stress is more consistent with the lower or mid-range of the cohort distribution rather than the upper half.

Protective or neutral self-report features include near-average self-esteem (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11) and regular engagement in solitary exercise (three times per week or more; exercise Z ≈ 1.07), which may buffer stress but do not appear to override the elevated symptom scores.

Objective sleep and sleep variability patterns from the wearable data align with the self-report sleep disturbance and suggest circadian irregularity that can be associated with perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is just under seven hours (6 h 57 min; Z ≈ -0.29), but night-to-night variability in sleep duration is high (SD = 159 minutes; Z = 1.32), and bedtimes are late on average (median sleep start ≈ 01:44). The standard deviation of sleep start times is also elevated (99 minutes; Z ≈ 0.36). The combination of late, irregular sleep timing and large variability in sleep duration is often linked to poorer subjective sleep quality and greater day-to-day stress reactivity; here, sleep variability has a small positive correlation with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.13).

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features point to a relatively blunted and less stable 24-hour pattern of cardiovascular activity. Parametric circadian measures show a modestly lower MESOR (mean HR ≈ 71 bpm, Z ≈ -0.41) and reduced amplitude (≈ 9.2 bpm, Z ≈ -0.52), while non-parametric markers indicate decreased interdaily stability (0.34, Z ≈ -0.57) and low 24-hour autocorrelation (0.24, Z ≈ -0.70). Intradaily variability is slightly lower than the population mean (value 0.51, Z ≈ -0.25). These features together imply a less robust, less regular heart-rate rhythm across days. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53 bpm, Z ≈ -0.61), which may reflect cardiovascular fitness or vagal tone but does not negate the reduced rhythm regularity. Several of these circadian/HR metrics have small correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.16, interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11, intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), supporting their relevance to perceived stress but indicating modest effect sizes.

Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and daytime/evening increases, with notable evening elevations (e.g., 7–10 pm deviations among the largest positive values). The participant’s acrophase is in the late afternoon/early evening (≈ 5:03 PM), consistent with higher cardiovascular activity later in the day and a late sleep schedule. While many of the hourly deviations show weak or mixed correlations with PSS, the pattern of elevated evening arousal combined with late sleep onset and high sleep variability is consistent with a behavioral-physiological profile that can sustain or reflect higher perceived stress.

Weighing evidence for low versus high perceived stress: indicators supporting higher PSS include elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D), elevated trait anxiety (STAI), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), large night-to-night sleep variability, late and irregular sleep timing, and reduced circadian stability/amplitude — several of which correlate positively (or inversely for amplitude/stability) with PSS in the sample. Indicators that could point away from elevated stress are a relatively low resting heart rate (potentially reflecting fitness), regular engagement in exercise, and near-average self-esteem; these factors are weaker in magnitude and show small correlations with PSS in this dataset. On balance, the substantive elevations in depressive and anxiety symptom scores together with objective sleep irregularity and blunted circadian rhythm metrics argue that the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

67192,31.0,0.9948186528497409,"The self-report profile indicates elevated internalizing symptoms and reduced subjective well-being that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score is 32 (Z = 1.95), and trait anxiety on the STAI is 58 (Z = 1.65); both values place this individual well above the sample mean on depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness. Complementary self-report indicators—low self-rated happiness (current = 2.0, Z = -1.61), low health satisfaction (Z = -2.03), and reduced trust (Z = -2.39)—further signal a relatively negative appraisal of well-being. These survey-derived measures have non-trivial positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (CES-D ~0.27, STAI ~0.31), which supports an interpretation that the participant’s subjective symptom burden would be associated with higher perceived stress relative to peers.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular metrics are consistent with elevated physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is 71.8 bpm (Z = 1.62) and the cosinor MESOR is 88.67 (Z = 2.01), both substantially above the study mean. Elevated mesor and resting heart rate can reflect higher tonic sympathetic drive or lower cardiovascular recovery, which often co-occurs with higher stress and negative affect. The hourly aggregated deviations show an expected nocturnal dip but comparatively large positive deviations in evening hours (notably 10–11 pm: +16.29, Z = 1.55; 9–10 pm: +12.47, Z = 0.77; and 6–7 pm: +13.07, Z = 0.10), suggesting relatively greater evening cardiovascular activation. Taken together with the positive albeit modest correlations of these metrics with PSS (resting HR correlation ~0.12), the wearable signals align with a physiological profile frequently observed in higher-stress individuals.

Sleep and circadian features show a mixed pattern that supports potential stress-related disruption in timing rather than gross sleep deprivation. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 16 minutes (Z = 0.10), which is near the sample average; however, the median sleep start time is late (about 01:15 AM) with high night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 110 minutes, Z = 0.59; sleep duration SD ≈ 108 minutes, Z = 0.16). The PSQI indicates subjectively disturbed sleep (score = 7), suggesting that despite average total sleep time the participant perceives poor sleep quality. Circadian regularity metrics (interdaily stability Z = 0.91; autocorrelation at 24 hours Z = 1.23) indicate relatively preserved day-to-day rhythm regularity, while intradaily variability is not elevated (Z ≈ -0.32). This pattern—late and variable sleep timing, subjective sleep complaints, and preserved 24-hour structure—is compatible with behavioral and psychological contributors to perceived stress (evening arousal, irregular sleep timing) without extreme sleep restriction.

Behavioral and lifestyle data provide additional context but do not contradict the overall stress signal. The participant reports substantial socializing (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.53) and higher engagement with video games (Z = 2.47); these activities may reflect social support or coping behaviors, but self-reported happiness remains low. Alcohol and drug use are minimal, and exercise frequency is modest (1–2 times per week). Low BMI (17.79) and notably low health satisfaction could reflect health concerns or body-image related stressors. Overall, lifestyle markers do not show strong protective effects that would offset the large negative affect and physiological arousal indicators.

Holistic synthesis and PSS group assignment: several convergent lines of evidence point toward higher perceived stress relative to the study population. High depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety, elevated resting heart rate and mesor, subjective sleep disturbance accompanied by late and inconsistent sleep timing, and low happiness and health satisfaction together indicate a profile more consistent with the upper half of the PSS distribution. Correlations in the dataset further support these links (CES-D and STAI are positively associated with PSS). Although some wearable circadian metrics show preserved regularity and social activity is high, these features do not outweigh the strong signal from mood, anxiety, and physiological arousal. On balance, the participant is more likely to fall into the top 50% of perceived stress in this study sample.

97448,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report measures indicate a profile consistent with relatively low affective symptom burden and adaptive behavioral habits. The participant’s CES-D score (3) and STAI–Trait score (33) are both well below the study mean (z-scores −1.07 and −0.82 respectively), indicating minimal recent depressive symptoms and relatively low trait anxiety. Self-esteem and trust measures are at or above average (self-esteem z = 0.4; trust z = 1.47). Academic performance and exercise frequency are strong (GPAs uniformly high; exercise alone three times a week or more, z = 1.07). Alcohol use is moderate (1–2 times per week for beer and liquor; z ≈ 1), and there is no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Together these self-reported characteristics (low depressive/anxiety symptom scores, active exercise, high trust, good academic performance, limited substance use) align with lower perceived stress in most population-level models.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac measures further support an organized physiological profile that is more consistent with lower perceived stress. Circadian regularity metrics—interdaily stability (0.53, z = 1.0) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.46, z = 1.15)—are elevated, indicating a regular, stable daily rhythm in heart-rate signals across recording days. Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is also high (z = 1.29) while mesor and resting heart rate are modest-to-low (resting HR = 50.8, z = −0.87), which together suggest robust day–night separation of cardiovascular activity and good cardiovascular fitness. Intradaily variability is near the sample median (z ≈ −0.04), indicating few abrupt within-day rhythm disruptions. These features (stable rhythms, relatively low resting HR) are typically associated with lower stress burden or better physiological regulation rather than chronic hyperarousal.

Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime/evening elevations; specifics of this participant include marked negative deviations overnight/early morning (large negative deviations z ≲ −1 at 1–8 AM) and pronounced positive deviations in the mid-afternoon to late evening (notably 2–3 PM, 8–10 PM with high z-scores). The participant’s acrophase is in the late afternoon (around 5:00 PM). Importantly, in the reference correlations provided many of the evening positive deviations and larger amplitude features trend weakly toward lower PSS in the sample (negative small correlations), and early-morning negative deviations are not signaling elevated stress in this individual. Overall, the heart-rate waveform and timing indicate a person with coherent circadian timing and no persistent daytime cardiac hyperarousal pattern that would clearly signal elevated perceived stress.

Sleep-derived metrics are mixed but do not strongly point to high perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 h 12 min (z ≈ 0.02), which is normative, and night-to-night variability in duration is relatively low (SD ≈ 63 min, z = −0.86). However, subjective sleep quality (PSQI score = 6) crosses the common threshold for “disturbed sleep,” which could reflect some sleep complaints; median sleep start time is late (01:44 AM), suggesting a delayed schedule or evening social/academic activity. The combination of objectively adequate total sleep time and low variability, with only mildly elevated subjective sleep disturbance, yields only a modest signal toward stress-related sleep disruption rather than a strong indicator.

Holistic synthesis and inference regarding perceived stress: the strongest and most consistent signals (very low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, regular and high-amplitude circadian heart-rate rhythm, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, good academic performance, limited substance use) collectively point toward a relatively low-to-average perceived stress level. The principal countervailing elements are a PSQI just above the standard cutoff and a late sleep onset, but these are isolated and modest in magnitude and do not outweigh the multiple markers of low affective symptom burden and orderly physiological rhythms. Given the available multimodal evidence and the provided correlations to PSS across the sample, the balance of features is most consistent with placement in the bottom half (lower or average perceived stress) of the study distribution.

67177,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Psychological self-report indicators converge on elevated internalizing symptoms that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) and depressive symptom score (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28) are both above the study mean and have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28). Self-esteem is comparatively low (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01) and shows a modest negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), while a very low self-reported “happy” score (current = 2.0, Z = -1.61) further indicates reduced positive affect. Together these self-report measures form a profile of higher internal distress and lower positive resources — patterns that, given their moderate correlations with perceived stress in the study cohort, point toward an above-median PSS.

Daily habits, subjective sleep, and social/health satisfaction provide additional context consistent with increased perceived stress. The PSQI (score = 7, classified as disturbed sleep; Z = 0.13) indicates poorer subjective sleep quality despite a median Fitbit-recorded sleep duration close to 7 hours (6 h 54 m, Z = -0.35). Sleep start is relatively late (median ~00:22) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD of sleep start ≈ 87 minutes, Z ≈ 0.08). The participant reports minimal physical activity and little exercise participation (exercise frequencies coded “Not at all,” Z-scores between -1.58 and -1.93) and limited social/leisure engagement; health satisfaction and trust are also low (Z ≈ -1.2 and -1.1 respectively). Low exercise, disturbed subjective sleep, and reduced social/health satisfaction are behavioral features that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress and therefore support an inference of elevated PSS.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics show a partially contrasting pattern that offers potential resilience effects. Heart-rate-based circadian regularity is relatively strong: interdaily stability is high (0.56, Z = 1.24) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.49, Z = 1.40), while intradaily variability is lower than average (0.44, Z = -0.74). Amplitude of the circadian rhythm is above average (13.32, Z = 0.82) and the mesor and resting heart rate are somewhat elevated (mesor Z = 1.11; resting HR = 65.2, Z = 0.84). These features — greater day-to-day regularity and a discernible amplitude — have modest negative correlations with PSS in the sample, suggesting that the participant’s consistent daily structure and clear day–night contrast could mitigate perceived stress. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal decreases and daytime/evening elevations (acrophase ~4:34 PM), with only small correlations to PSS at individual hours.

Integrated evaluation and PSS-group assignment: weighing the evidence, self-report psychological indicators (notably elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, low positive affect, low self-esteem), behavioral risk factors (little exercise, disturbed subjective sleep, low satisfaction), and their moderate correlations with PSS point toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study population. Wearable circadian regularity provides a notable counterweight — a potential protective factor — but its negative correlations with PSS are smaller in magnitude than the positive correlations linking anxiety and depression to PSS. On balance, the preponderance of signals supporting higher perceived stress (and the direct, moderate correlations of those signals with PSS) indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

87328,15.0,0.038860103626943004,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant’s self-report scales consistently indicate low internalizing symptom burden and relatively positive self-regard. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are at the floor (score = 0; Z = -1.38) and trait anxiety on the STAI is notably low (score = 23; Z = -1.81). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated relative to the study sample (self-esteem Z = 1.66; current happiness Z = 1.64). These trait- and state-level survey indicators are directionally associated with lower perceived stress in the study correlations (CES-D and STAI correlate positively with PSS; self-esteem and happiness correlate negatively), suggesting that, from a symptom and self-concept standpoint, the participant is unlikely to report high perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs) and engages in modest regular sports activity (1–2 times per week; Z = 0.91) but otherwise low frequency of planned exercise. Social and sedentary recreation are prominent: high amounts of socializing (>4 hours, Z = 2.53) and prolonged passive media use (watching TV/videos 3–4 hours, Z = 2.54). Health satisfaction is relatively low (Z = -1.20) and body mass index is in the overweight range (BMI = 27.12). These behavioral features provide a mixed picture: strong social engagement and low substance use are typically protective against perceived stress, whereas lower health satisfaction and greater sedentary leisure could reflect areas of discontent or passive coping that might relate to stress in some contexts.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart rate–based circadian metrics indicate a robust and regular daily rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.53; Z = 1.0) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.51; Z = 1.57) are above typical values, and amplitude is relatively high (16.28; Z = 1.78). Resting heart rate is low-to-moderate (54.4 bpm; Z = -0.45). The hourly aggregate deviations show large nocturnal nadirs and pronounced evening peaks (notably a large positive deviation around 6–7 pm; Z = 2.62), consistent with a strong diurnal separation of rest and activity. In the study’s correlational patterns, stronger circadian amplitude and stability tended to relate to lower PSS (negative correlations around -0.11 to -0.16), and the participant’s above-average rhythmicity therefore aligns with lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with PSS (0.14), but this participant’s resting HR is below the sample mean, again consistent with lower stress-related cardiovascular arousal.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep quality: Objectively the participant averages approximately 7 hours 25 minutes of nightly sleep (median duration Z = 0.30) with relatively low night-to-night variability in start time (start SD Z = -0.72) and moderate variability in duration (duration SD Z = -0.57). Napping is infrequent (mean daily naps 0.18; Z = 1.21). However, the median sleep start time is late (about 01:26), and the PSQI score is 7 (classification “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating some subjective sleep difficulties despite adequate aggregate duration. Study correlations show small or mixed associations between these sleep measures and PSS (sleep variability positively correlated with PSS at r ≈ 0.14), so any sleep-related contribution to perceived stress would be modest. Taken together, objective regularity and sufficient duration argue against major sleep-related stress exposure, while the elevated PSQI and late timing point to some subjective sleep complaints that could mildly elevate perceived stress for this individual.

Holistic interpretation and PSS placement: Integrating the multimodal data yields a coherent pattern favoring relatively low perceived stress. Low trait anxiety and negligible depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, strong social engagement, robust circadian rhythmicity and low resting heart rate are each individually associated with lower PSS scores in the study and are prominent in this participant’s profile. Countervailing signals (PSQI >5 indicating subjective sleep disturbance, lower health satisfaction, and some sedentary leisure) are present but modest in magnitude and less directly predictive of elevated perceived stress given the stronger, convergent evidence for low symptom burden and physiologic stability. Therefore, on balance the evidence supports placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

49497,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Psychological symptom profile and self-report indicators:
The participant’s self-report measures show pronounced internalizing symptomatology and self-evaluative risk factors that are strongly consistent with elevated perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden is very high (CES-D = 49, Z = 3.71) and trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 64, Z = 2.24); both scales are positively correlated with PSS in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), suggesting these symptoms would likely co-occur with higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is substantially below the sample mean (RSES = 22, Z = -2.28), and single-item measures of happiness and interpersonal trust are low (happiness Z ≈ -1.61; trust Z ≈ -1.42). Subjective sleep quality is also poor (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05), which in combination with the symptom profile further points to elevated psychological burden rather than the lower-stress end of the distribution.

Behavioral context and potential coping patterns:
Several behavioral markers indicate limited social buffering and use of potentially maladaptive coping strategies. The participant reports little social exercise and relatively limited socializing (socializing time Z ≈ -1.41) while reporting regular solitary exercise. Recreational substance use is unusually high relative to peers (recreational drugs Z = 5.44; non-prescribed drugs Z = 13.79), and alcohol use is above average (beer/wine ~1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0). Internet use is elevated (3–4 hours, Z ≈ 1.52). These patterns—low social engagement, frequent solitary activities, and elevated substance use—are behaviorally consistent with attempts to manage mood or stress and are not typical of low-stress profiles.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Objective wearable data indicate circadian irregularity and fragmented daily structure. Interdaily stability is low (0.21, Z = -1.65) while intradaily variability is moderately elevated (0.63, Z = 0.60), together indicating weak day-to-day consistency and greater within-day fragmentation of heart-rate rhythms. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (amplitude Z ≈ -1.56) despite a mesor near the sample mean (mesor Z ≈ 0.23). The participant’s median sleep midpoint and timing are late (median sleep start ~01:14) and highly variable (sleep start SD = 204 minutes, Z = 2.65), with median nightly sleep duration below sample average (6.5 hours, Z ≈ -0.85) and elevated night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z ≈ 1.06). These objective features—irregular timing, shortened average sleep, and greater variability—are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress and poorer mood.

Physiological arousal patterns from heart rate:
Resting heart rate is within the typical range for the sample (≈60.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.29). Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal heart-rate declines and daytime elevations, but notable relative increases around mid-morning (9–11am) and an evening elevation at ~10–11pm. Correlations between some heart-rate/circadian metrics and PSS are modest (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16; resting HR r ≈ 0.14), so while physiological signals show more fragmented and lower amplitude rhythms—consistent with stress-linked dysregulation—the wearable physiology provides supporting rather than definitive evidence on its own.

Holistic interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Convergent lines of evidence point toward elevated perceived stress for this participant. Strong, direct indicators include markedly elevated depressive and trait-anxiety scores and low self-esteem, which are reliably associated with higher PSS in the study sample. Behavioral indicators (irregular and late sleep schedule with high variability, elevated substance use, low social activity) and wearable-derived circadian disruption (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, increased intradaily variability) form a consistent pattern associated with higher stress. Physiological measures provide supplementary support (some daytime/evening HR elevations and rhythm fragmentation) but correlate only modestly with PSS in this sample. Taken together, the self-report psychopathology and the behavioral/circadian disruption produce a coherent profile that aligns with the higher half of the population distribution for perceived stress.

Final classification:
Given the strong and convergent evidence from high depressive and anxiety symptom scores, low self-esteem, disturbed and irregular sleep, elevated substance use, reduced social engagement, and wearable-indicated circadian disruption, the participant’s overall perceived stress is most consistent with the top half of the study population distribution.

33785,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report measures indicate a notable burden of internalizing symptoms that are typically associated with elevated perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score is 27 (Z = 1.42), classified as “depressed,” and trait anxiety (STAI) is 56 (Z = 1.45), classified as “anxious.” Both of these measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), suggesting that the participant’s above-average depressive and anxiety symptom levels would tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) and has a modest negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.16), providing additional self-report evidence consistent with greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is slightly disturbed (PSQI = 7, Z = 0.13), which can contribute to stress perception, although this score is only mildly elevated relative to the cohort.

Behavioral and lifestyle reports provide a mixed picture but do not offset the psychological symptom signal. The participant exercises alone frequently (three or more times per week; Z = 1.07), and median nightly sleep duration (7 h 20 min; Z = 0.18) is near the cohort mean—both factors that are typically associated with lower stress. Alcohol and drug use are low, and self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are modestly above average (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.38), which could mitigate stress. However, high engagement in sedentary hobbies and video gaming (sedentary hobby Z = 2.01; video games Z = 2.47) and relatively low self-esteem may reflect coping patterns or social behaviors that do not buffer stress as effectively. Correlations of these activity items with PSS are small and mixed, so their net effect on perceived stress is uncertain but unlikely to outweigh the elevated symptom measures.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics indicate overall circadian regularity and generally normal cardiovascular baselines, which argue against extreme physiological stress signatures. Non-parametric circadian features show moderate interdaily stability (value = 0.48, Z = 0.58) and very low intradaily variability (value = 0.25, Z = -2.08); autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (Z = 1.06). Mesor and amplitude of heart rate are slightly above the population mean (mesor Z = 0.39; amplitude Z = 0.54), resting heart rate is low-normal (58.7 bpm, Z = 0.07), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a robust nocturnal dip and daytime elevations consistent with a regular activity-rest rhythm (acrophase ~4:49 PM). These features are generally associated with stable daily organization and do not show strong relationships with PSS in the sample (small correlations reported), suggesting physiological rhythms are relatively intact despite elevated self-reported symptoms.

Holistic synthesis and PSS-group determination: the strongest and most consistent signals in this profile are elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (both Z > 1.4), which have the largest and most consistent positive correlations with PSS in the dataset. Secondary self-report indicators (lower self-esteem, modestly disturbed sleep) further point toward increased perceived stress. Contrasting evidence (regular sleep duration, frequent exercise, stable circadian physiology, low substance use, modest happiness/health satisfaction) would tend to lower perceived stress but are either only mildly protective or have weak correlations with PSS in this sample. On balance, the weight of evidence—particularly the elevated internalizing symptom scores that are empirically linked to higher PSS—supports that this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of the study population on perceived stress.

33009,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report profile and trait symptoms:
The participant’s self-report measures present a generally low-to-average affective symptom burden. A CES-D score of 9 (z = -0.45) indicates relatively few recent depressive symptoms, and trait anxiety on the STAI (score = 40, z ≈ -0.13) is near the sample mean though labeled “anxious” by the instrument’s categorical flag. Self-esteem is at the upper end of the scale (RSES = 40, z = 0.26), which is typically protective against perceived stress (RSES correlates negative with PSS, r ≈ -0.15). Subjective happiness and health satisfaction are somewhat below study-average (happiness z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction z ≈ -0.45), which could modestly elevate perceived stress, but the overall pattern of affective self-report reads as low-to-moderate symptomatology rather than high symptom burden.

Objective sleep and sleep-related subjective reports:
Wearable-recorded sleep duration is robust (median 7 h 54 m, z = 0.89) with low night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 55 min, z = -1.03), indicating relatively consistent and sufficient sleep quantity. The participant reports somewhat disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 7, nominally above the common cutoff), suggesting some subjective sleep-quality concerns that are not mirrored in reduced duration. Sleep timing is somewhat late (median sleep start ≈ 00:51) but stable (start-time SD z ≈ -0.61). The combination—adequate, regular duration but mildly elevated subjective disturbance—points to limited sleep-related contribution to elevated perceived stress overall; sleep quantity and regularity favor lower perceived stress, while the PSQI flags a small subjective disturbance risk.

Circadian heart-rate structure and physiological markers:
Cardiovascular circadian features show signs of reduced rhythmic robustness. Cosinor amplitude is lower than the study mean (amplitude z ≈ -0.92) and interdaily stability is below average (z ≈ -0.49), while intradaily variability is elevated (z ≈ 0.53). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (z ≈ -0.45). These non-parametric and parametric indicators together indicate a weaker, more fragmented heart-rate rhythm across days. Resting heart rate is low-normal (58.1 bpm, z ≈ -0.01). Importantly, aggregated hourly deviations show a typical nocturnal decline in heart rate (large negative deviations overnight) but the pattern of correlations with PSS suggests that blunted nocturnal dipping (i.e., relatively higher overnight HR, or smaller negative deviation) is associated with higher PSS in this sample (positive correlations in early-morning hours, r ~ 0.14–0.22). Similarly, higher intradaily variability and reduced amplitude have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.16 and r ≈ -0.17 for amplitude [negative relation], respectively). Taken together, the participant’s wearable-derived circadian profile (weakened amplitude, lower stability, higher fragmentation) aligns with physiological patterns that, in this sample, modestly co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators:
Reported lifestyle behaviors are generally moderate and do not strongly indicate high stress-related coping. Alcohol use is relatively infrequent (beer 1–2/month; wine/liquor 1–2/week). The participant exercises with moderate frequency (1–2×/week alone and with others) and reports low sedentary recreational engagement (limited TV, gaming, music listening). Academic performance (GPAs) is solid. These lifestyle features are more consistent with adaptive functioning than with severe stress-related impairment.

Holistic synthesis and impact on perceived stress classification:
Evidence is mixed but leans toward average-to-lower perceived stress. Several strong indicators point toward lower PSS relative to the sample: low depressive symptom score, high self-esteem, adequate and regular sleep duration, low resting heart rate, stable academic performance, and moderate, non-excessive substance and exercise behaviors. In contrast, wearable-derived circadian metrics reveal a less robust and somewhat fragmented heart-rate rhythm (reduced amplitude and interdaily stability, increased intradaily variability) — features that are associated in this cohort with higher PSS and with an attenuated nocturnal heart-rate dip. These physiological signals suggest a modest physiological vulnerability or reactivity that could elevate perceived stress relative to the most resilient individuals, but their magnitude (z-scores mostly modest) and the stronger weight of the psychological and behavioral indicators favor an interpretation of no clear elevation into the upper half of the population’s perceived-stress distribution. On balance—integrating trait reports, sleep quantity/regularity, lifestyle functioning, and wearable physiology—the participant’s profile is most consistent with being at or below the sample median for perceived stress rather than in the top half.

Median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 27 minutes (Z = -2.16), well below the study mean, while night-to-night sleep duration variability is extreme (SD = 359 minutes; Z = 5.88). The median sleep start time is very late (04:42 AM) with very high day-to-day variability in sleep start (SD = 422 minutes; Z = 7.44). Circadian summary metrics from heart rate show low interdaily stability (0.22; Z = -1.56) and very low 24-hour autocorrelation (0.11; Z = -1.79), combined with a reduced amplitude (6.21; Z = -1.48) and lower mesor (66.6 bpm; Z = -1.0). Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.6; Z = 0.39). Taken together, these patterns describe a physiologic rhythm that is relatively low in amplitude and poorly entrained day-to-day, with highly irregular and insufficient sleep — a profile that, in the literature and in this dataset, is associated with elevated perceived stress.

Heart rate profile and activity timing:
Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show a clear nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations from ~1–7 AM) and modest daytime elevations around late morning and early evening, with an acrophase near 5:09 PM. Resting heart rate is slightly lower than the study mean (55.5 bpm; Z = -0.32). The nocturnal dipping pattern itself appears preserved, but the combination of low overall amplitude, low interdaily stability, and elevated intradaily variability implies fragmented or irregular daily physiology. These circadian irregularities and rhythm fragmentation are modestly correlated in this sample with higher PSS scores (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16; 24-hour autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; amplitude r ≈ -0.16), supporting the interpretation that this physiologic profile aligns with increased perceived stress.

Self-report psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context:
Self-report measures present a mixed picture. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 8; Z = -0.55) while trait anxiety is slightly above average (STAI = 42; Z = 0.07). Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 7). Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40; Z ≈ 0.26), and substance use is minimal. Socializing and recreational engagement are low (socializing Z ≈ -1.41; many sedentary hobbies minimal), and physical exercise is infrequent. Happiness is slightly below average (current happiness score 3; Z = -0.53). These self-report indicators provide some protective signals (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, low substance use) but also reflect behavioral patterns (poor subjective sleep, low social/physical engagement) that commonly co-occur with elevated perceived stress.

Weighing evidence for PSS placement:
Evidence consistent with lower or average perceived stress (bottom half): low CES-D score, relatively normal STAI (near the mean), high self-esteem, low substance use, and a low resting heart rate provide some indicators that negative affect and physiologic baseline arousal are not greatly elevated. Correlations between some of these measures and PSS are small in magnitude.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress (top half): very short median sleep duration, clinical-level subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), extreme variability in sleep timing, and low interdaily stability / low 24-hour autocorrelation point to substantial circadian and sleep dysregulation. Several circadian metrics in this dataset are modestly associated with higher PSS (negative autocorrelation and amplitude correlations, positive intradaily variability correlation). Behaviorally, limited socializing and infrequent exercise remove common buffering factors against stress. The magnitude of sleep shortness and especially the extreme variability in sleep timing (Z-scores > 5–7) are strong signals that align with elevated perceived stress in student samples.

Holistic interpretation and final placement:
Balancing protective psychological features (low depressive symptoms and high self-esteem) against strong objective indicators of severe sleep restriction and circadian irregularity, the overall pattern is more consistent with elevated perceived stress. The wearable-derived sleep and rhythm disturbances are large in magnitude and are established correlates of higher PSS in this population; they outweigh the modest protective signals from mood and self-esteem. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

79395,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Multimodal summary of self-report psychological measures:
The participant’s self-report profile contains several indicators that are typically associated with elevated perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D is high (score = 32, Z = +1.95), and trait anxiety on the STAI is elevated (score = 54, Z = +1.25). Self-esteem is low relative to the sample (RSES = 25, Z = -1.85) and current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61). These measures have nontrivial positive correlations with PSS in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.29, STAI r ≈ 0.32; lower self-esteem correlates weakly with higher PSS r ≈ -0.16), indicating that the participant’s comparatively high depression and anxiety scores, and low self-esteem/happiness, are consistent with a higher perceived stress profile.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep quality:
Objective sleep duration is near the study mean (median sleep = 7 h 15 min, Z ≈ +0.09) and nightly variability in duration is not elevated (SD ≈ 88 minutes, Z ≈ -0.29). However, sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:21 AM) although fairly consistent (sleep start SD = 47 minutes, Z ≈ -0.80). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) is above the common clinical cutoff for disturbance and is classified as “Disturbed Sleep.” Taken together, the participant obtains adequate total sleep time on average but at a late and consistent circadian timing, with subjective complaints of disturbed sleep—features that can contribute to perceived stress even when duration is adequate.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac patterns:
Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate relatively strong day-to-day regularity: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.55, Z ≈ +1.16) and 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (0.46, Z ≈ +1.15), while intradaily variability is lower than average (0.47, Z ≈ -0.53). These features indicate a well-structured, regular circadian heart rate rhythm across days. The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are slightly below sample average (resting HR = 56.7 bpm, mesor ≈ 72.3 bpm; small negative Z-scores), which is typically neutral-to-protective with respect to stress burden in population analyses. Amplitude and acrophase (peak around 5:26 PM) show a typical daily pattern.

Temporal patterning of physiological arousal:
Aggregated hourly deviations from mesor show pronounced nocturnal declines in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and positive deviations in the afternoon and evening, including relatively large positive deviations at ~9–11 PM (9–10 PM and 10–11 PM show among the highest Z-scores). The elevated evening heart-rate deviations, combined with a late habitual bedtime, suggest physiological arousal or behavioral activation occurring late in the evening. Correlations between many hourly deviations and PSS are small and mixed, but the pattern of evening physiological elevation paired with subjective sleep disturbance is consistent with processes that commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral and social context:
The participant reports engaging in social exercise frequently (exercising with others three or more times per week, Z ≈ +1.23), moderate alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week), and limited recreational drug use. Daily leisure and socialization times are generally close to sample averages. These social and physical-activity behaviors are potential resilience or buffering factors against stress and may partly offset some physiological or mood-related risks.

Synthesis regarding perceived stress level:
Evidence supporting a higher perceived stress classification (top half of the sample) is substantial in the self-report domain: clinically elevated depressive symptoms and heightened trait anxiety, together with low self-esteem and low happiness, are robust and correlate positively with PSS in this dataset. Evidence supporting lower or average perceived stress includes objectively regular circadian rhythms, a relatively low resting heart rate, consistent sleep timing, adequate average sleep duration, and frequent social exercise—each of which are associated with lower PSS or resilience in the sample. Weighing these domains holistically, the relatively large-magnitude elevations in depression and trait anxiety (Z ≈ +1.25 to +1.95) and low self-esteem/happiness carry greater direct relevance to perceived stress than the modestly protective wearable-derived features. Therefore the overall profile is more consistent with a PSS score in the higher half of the study distribution.

59863,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report psychological and behavioral profile: The participant’s self-reported symptom and trait measures indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and several psychosocial resources that typically relate to lower perceived stress. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are low (score = 5; Z = -0.86) and trait anxiety is well below the sample mean (STAI trait = 24; Z = -1.71), both of which would individually predict lower PSS scores given their positive correlations with PSS in the sample. Self-esteem and momentary positive affect are both notably high (SelfEsteem Z = 1.66; Happy Z = 1.64), and overall health satisfaction is elevated (Z = 1.3). The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.07) and minimal recreational drug use. Taken together, these questionnaire-based indicators form a consistent pattern of psychological resources and low symptom burden that ordinarily associate with lower perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian behavior: Wearable and subjective sleep measures indicate generally sufficient and regular sleep. Median nightly sleep is about 7 hours 24 minutes (Z = 0.27), with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 70 minutes; Z = -0.69) and in sleep onset timing (start time SD Z = -0.21). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; Z = -0.8) is at or slightly better than sample-average. Circadian rhythm non-parametric indices derived from heart rate show reasonable day-to-day stability (interdaily stability = 0.46; Z = 0.42) and comparatively low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.38; Z = -1.16). These sleep and circadian features—adequate sleep duration, regular timing, and stable daily structure—converge with lower PSS in the cohort-level correlations and reduce the likelihood that sleep disruption is driving elevated perceived stress.

Physiological/behavioral activity synthesis: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics reveal a clear diurnal pattern (acrophase ≈ 4:23 PM; amplitude Z = 1.01) and a relatively high mesor and resting heart rate (Mesor = 91.26 bpm, Z = 2.36; Resting HR = 67.65 bpm, Z = 1.13). The hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal heart-rate nadir (roughly -20 bpm overnight) and daytime elevations peaking in the afternoon. Several circadian regularity metrics (autocorrelation at 24h Z = 0.64; amplitude Z = 1.01) are above average, reflecting a pronounced and consistent rhythm. Although a higher mesor and resting HR can indicate a higher baseline physiological arousal and are weakly positively associated with PSS in the sample (small positive correlations reported), these physiological elevations occur alongside strong rhythm regularity and favorable behavioral patterns (exercise, sleep regularity). The cohort-level correlations between circadian regularity/amplitude and lower PSS (negative correlations) suggest the robust rhythmicity mitigates concern about the modestly elevated mesor.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress (PSS): Across multiple modalities the preponderance of evidence points toward relatively low perceived stress. Self-report symptom scales (low CES-D and STAI), elevated self-esteem and happiness, stable and sufficient sleep, frequent exercise, and pronounced circadian regularity are all consistent with lower PSS and have cohort-level negative correlations with PSS or are protective in the sample. The primary countervailing signal is an elevated heart-rate mesor and slightly higher resting HR (both Z > 1), which could reflect modestly higher baseline physiological activation; however, these physiological metrics show only weak positive correlations with PSS in the sample and occur within a broader context of psychosocial resilience. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

22913,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report measures indicate a relatively low internal symptom burden and adaptive self-evaluations. The participant reports no depressive symptoms on the CES-D (score = 0, Z = -1.38) and below-average trait anxiety on the STAI (score = 34, Z = -0.72). Self-esteem is at the high end of the scale (38/40, Z ≈ -0.03) and global health satisfaction is near the sample mean (4.33/7, Z = 0.05). Sleep quality by PSQI is in the “good sleep” range (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Recreational and social behaviors are modest: limited exercise (mostly 1–2×/month, low sports participation) and short periods of media or leisure activity, while alcohol use is modestly above average (beer and spirits 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0). Overall, the self-report profile emphasizes low affective symptomatology and adequate subjective sleep, with some lifestyle features (low exercise, somewhat elevated alcohol frequency) that could be targets for behavioral intervention but do not themselves indicate elevated perceived stress in this dataset.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics are broadly consistent with a relatively stable and robust daily rhythm. The cosinor amplitude is elevated relative to the sample (amplitude Z = 0.84) and intradaily variability is low (Value = 0.29, Z = -1.8), a pattern commonly associated with organized day–night structure rather than fragmented or stress-reactive rhythms. Interdaily stability is average (0.41, Z ≈ 0.0). Median nightly sleep duration measured by the Fitbit is long compared with the sample (median 8 h 37 min, Z = 1.79) and sleep timing is reasonably regular (median start ≈ 23:55, SD Z = 0.0). Heart-rate summary values show a higher mesor (87.24, Z = 1.81) and a resting heart rate slightly above the sample mean (64.6 bpm, Z = 0.77); these elevated baseline cardiac values are small-to-moderate deviations but have only modest positive correlations with PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.06–0.14), and they do not coincide with other markers of autonomic dysregulation (e.g., high intradaily variability). Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime peaks (acrophase ≈ 4:49 PM), consistent with intact circadian modulation of cardiovascular activity.

Evidence for lower-than-average perceived stress: multiple direct and indirect indicators converge on lower stress—minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0), below-average trait anxiety, good subjective sleep (PSQI Z = -0.8), long and regular objective sleep, low intradaily variability (Z = -1.8), and relatively large circadian amplitude (Z = 0.84). Correlations in the dataset indicate that lower depression and anxiety scores are associated with lower PSS in this sample, and this participant’s scores on those measures are on the low side. Evidence that could point toward higher perceived stress is limited and comparatively weak: resting heart rate and mesor are elevated (Z = 0.77 and 1.81 respectively), and alcohol use is somewhat above average (Z ≈ 1.0), but these signals have only small correlations with PSS in the study and are not supported by concurrent symptom or behavioral indicators of high stress.

Holistic assessment and group assignment: weighing the strong indicators of low internalizing symptoms and organized, regular sleep–wake and cardiac rhythms against the isolated elevations in baseline heart rate and alcohol frequency, the preponderance of evidence supports the participant belonging to the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress (bottom 50%).

48969,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report measures indicate substantial affective symptom burden that is relevant to perceived stress. The participant endorsed a very high level of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 42; Z ≈ +3.0) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 59; Z ≈ +1.8). Self-esteem is markedly low (RSES = 22; Z ≈ −2.3). These survey features are among the strongest deviations from the study mean and are each positively associated with higher PSS in the population (STAI and CES-D show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the dataset). In combination, the large positive z-scores on mood/anxiety scales and the negative z-score for self-esteem point toward elevated subjective emotional burden that is likely to increase perceived stress.

Sleep reports and wearable sleep metrics show a mixed signal that also favors elevated perceived stress when interpreted holistically. The participant’s subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 13; Z ≈ +2.9), indicating considerable sleep disturbance, yet objective Fitbit-derived nightly duration is near or above the sample median (median sleep ≈ 7 h 51 min; Z ≈ +0.8) with moderate night-to-night variability. Median sleep start time is shortly after midnight (00:06) with moderate timing variability. The mismatch of relatively adequate objective duration but high subjective disturbance (large PSQI z-score) commonly occurs in states of elevated distress and is consistent with PSS-relevant sleep complaints; PSQI scores in this dataset are generally associated with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral habits reveal pronounced sedentary and solitary patterns that are relevant to stress exposure and coping. The participant reports very high recreational screen time (video games Z ≈ +4.7; TV Z ≈ +3.2; internet/music Z ≈ +2.0 each) and minimal time socializing with friends (Z ≈ −2.2). Exercise frequency is notable for being regular but solitary (exercised alone three times/week; Z ≈ +1.1), and substance use is low. High solitary screen-based recreation and limited in-person social contact, together with low self-esteem and elevated mood/anxiety symptoms, are consistent with psychosocial conditions that tend to accompany higher perceived stress levels in student samples.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian features are broadly consistent with increased physiological arousal and a somewhat flattened rhythm. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (≈68.6 bpm; Z ≈ +1.2). Cosinor-derived MESOR is moderately elevated (Z ≈ +0.8) while amplitude is slightly reduced (Z ≈ −0.4), and interdaily stability/intradaily variability are near the sample mean—indicating a present but somewhat blunted day–night heart rate rhythm. Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations in early morning hours) and daytime elevations centered in the afternoon/evening; daytime positive deviations (e.g., midday and early evening peaks) are moderately large. These physiological patterns—higher baseline cardiac tone and reduced amplitude—can be observed in contexts of chronic stress or affective symptoms and correlate modestly with PSS in the cohort.

Integrating multimodal evidence yields a coherent picture: strong and convergent indicators of elevated emotional distress (very high depressive symptom score, elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem), subjectively poor sleep, social isolation and high sedentary screen use, and modestly elevated physiological arousal. Against that, objective sleep duration and regular solitary exercise are potential buffering factors but are not sufficient to outweigh the large affective symptom load. Given the magnitude of the mood and sleep disturbances (large positive z-scores) and their known associations with perceived stress, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s overall perceived stress is more consistent with the upper half of the study distribution.

79731,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological self-report profile and implications for perceived stress:
The participant reports elevated self-reported affective symptoms that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety is high (STAI = 60, z = 1.85) and depressive symptoms are elevated (CES-D = 27, z = 1.42); both scales show positive correlations with PSS in the study (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28), indicating these scores tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress in the cohort. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, z = -1.29), a variable that is negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.15) and can reflect lower perceived coping resources. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11, z = 1.98), which in this sample is associated with stress-related burden. Together, these survey-derived indicators (high anxiety and depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep) point toward a psychological profile in which perceived stress is likely elevated.

Sleep behavior and subjective/objective sleep metrics:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a late and variable sleep schedule with compensatory long median sleep duration. Median sleep onset is very late (02:58 AM) while median sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 17 m, z = 1.37) accompanied by high night-to-night duration variability (SD = 177 min, z = 1.73). Self-reported poor sleep quality (PSQI high) aligns with these objective patterns: late timing, inconsistent duration, and large variability, which in aggregate are commonly linked to greater perceived stress and poorer daytime functioning. The participant also exhibits slightly elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps 0.19, z = 1.34), which can be compensatory for fragmented or insufficient nighttime sleep and is modestly positively correlated with PSS in this sample.

Circadian rhythm and heart rate physiology:
Heart-rate–based circadian and resting physiology show features consistent with physiological arousal and circadian dysregulation. Resting heart rate is elevated (71.2 bpm, z = 1.55), and the overall MESOR is moderately high (79.9, z = 0.81). The amplitude of the fitted circadian rhythm is relatively low (amplitude = 7.09, z = -1.19), while intradaily variability is increased (IV = 0.64, z = 0.67) and interdaily stability is reduced (IS = 0.34, z = -0.57). This combination — higher resting HR, dampened amplitude, greater within-day fragmentation and lower day-to-day stability — is often observed with chronic stress, mood disturbance, and irregular schedules. Several early-morning hourly deviations from MESOR show positive correlations with PSS (hours 2–7am with r ≈ 0.14–0.21), suggesting that physiological markers during sleep/wake transitions in this participant are associated with higher perceived stress in the cohort.

Lifestyle, health indicators, and behavioral context:
Behavioral and health indicators provide additional context that aligns with elevated stress exposure. The participant reports minimal physical exercise (multiple exercise items z-scores strongly negative), low health satisfaction (z = -1.53), and a BMI near the overweight threshold (29.86). Recreational drug and alcohol use are low, and socializing is modest (1–2 hours), so substance use is unlikely to explain elevated physiological arousal. High subjective happiness is only modestly above average (current = 4.0, z = 0.55) and does not offset the constellation of high anxiety, depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep, diminished physical activity, and physiological markers of arousal.

Synthesis regarding perceived stress (PSS) placement:
Evidence supporting a lower/median PSS placement: some behaviors that might mitigate stress (low substance use, some social contact, relatively long median sleep duration) and a modestly positive current-happiness rating could be consistent with lower or average perceived stress. However, these are secondary relative to stronger indicators of stress burden.
Evidence supporting a higher PSS placement: multiple, convergent indicators point toward elevated perceived stress — notably high trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores (z > 1.4), poor subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ 2.0), elevated resting heart rate (z ≈ 1.55), dampened circadian amplitude and increased rhythm fragmentation, large night-to-night sleep variability, low exercise and low health satisfaction. Several of these measures have positive correlations with PSS in the study sample (e.g., STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28, IV and some sleep variability metrics r ≈ 0.14–0.21), increasing the likelihood that the participant’s perceived stress is above the sample median.

Conclusion:
On balance, the multimodal evidence (elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep, physiological arousal and circadian irregularity, and low health-related behaviors) more strongly supports placement in the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress. Therefore the participant is most consistent with the top 50% of PSS scores in this population.

64296,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms relative to the study cohort (CES-D = 3.0, Z = -1.07; STAI-Trait = 35, Z = -0.62). Subjective indicators of positive well-being are elevated (self-reported happiness = 5.0, Z = 1.64; self-esteem Z = 0.96), and sleep quality by questionnaire is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5.0, Z = -0.8). Substance use is minimal or absent across alcohol and recreational drug items. Taken together, these self-report measures form a consistent pattern of relatively low affective symptom burden and above-average positive affect/self-regard compared with the sampled population—features that, empirically, tend to accompany lower perceived stress.

Behavioral and social habits: The participant reports limited daily recreational screen time and low frequency of socializing (socializing 16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41). Exercise is infrequent alone but present with others at a modest rate (1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.5 for exercising with others), and the participant reports virtually no naps. These behaviors indicate a generally low-engagement leisure profile with some structured social/physical activity. Reduced social time can be a potential risk factor for higher stress for some individuals, but in this case it co-occurs with high self-reported happiness and low mood/anxiety scores, suggesting the participant’s subjective resources and routines are sufficient to maintain lower perceived stress despite limited social/leisure exposure.

Circadian and cardiovascular rhythm structure: Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a highly regular, high-amplitude heart rate rhythm across the recording period (interdaily stability = 0.58, Z = 1.41; autocorrelation at 24h = 0.48, Z = 1.32; amplitude = 19.12, Z = 2.70). These parametric and non-parametric measures indicate a strong and consistent daily structure in physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is low (49.8 bpm, Z = -0.99), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. High rhythm regularity and amplitude are typically associated with better stress regulation; in this dataset those features also show modest negative correlations with PSS, reinforcing their relevance to lower perceived stress.

Daily heart-rate pattern and sleep timing: Aggregated hourly deviations from mesor indicate a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline (peak negative deviations around 3–5 AM, values down to ≈ -34 bpm, Zs ≤ -2.6) and daytime elevations with a late afternoon peak (~4–5 PM, +23 bpm, Z = 2.14). Sleep tracking shows a median nightly sleep duration slightly below average (median 6 h 52 min, Z = -0.4) with late but consistent sleep onset (median start ≈ 01:07:30; sleep start SD ≈ 50 min, Z = -0.72) and low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 42 minutes, Z = -1.33). The combination of consistent sleep timing, low variability, robust nocturnal heart-rate reduction, and low resting heart rate supports physiological recovery and circadian health despite a relatively late bedtime.

Evidence for PSS placement: Indicators consistent with lower perceived stress include low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, elevated happiness and self-esteem, minimal substance use, and strong circadian regularity and amplitude—each of which has either a direct negative association with PSS in this dataset or is conceptually linked to better stress regulation. Potential signals that could point toward higher stress are minimal: slightly shorter-than-average sleep duration and limited socializing, though sleep quality is reported as good and sleep timing is stable, and correlations of these features with PSS are small in magnitude. Several wearable–PSS correlations are small and mixed, but the dominant pattern across self-report and physiology is toward lower psychosocial strain.

Summary conclusion: Integrating self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological data yields a coherent profile of relatively low perceived stress compared with the study population. The participant’s low affective symptom scores, higher positive affect and self-esteem, absence of substance use, and highly regular, high-amplitude circadian heart-rate profile collectively point toward placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution.

These self-report indices that most directly map onto perceived stress show more evidence of resilience than vulnerability: lower-than-average depressive and anxiety symptoms and relatively high self-regard and health satisfaction. Correlations provided in the dataset indicate modest positive associations of CES-D and STAI with PSS (r ≈ 0.28 and r ≈ 0.31 respectively), so the participant’s lower scores on those measures argue against placement in the upper half of the PSS distribution.

Sleep and subjective sleep complaints: Wearable-derived sleep duration is short (median nightly sleep ≈ 5 h 44 min, Z ≈ -1.81) and the self-report PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI = 8, Z ≈ +0.59). The participant’s sleep timing is late but relatively stable (median sleep onset ≈ 01:11, low SD of sleep start times). Short objective sleep duration together with a PSQI in the disturbed range suggests sleep-related strain that can contribute to perceived stress and daytime impairment. However, correlations in the provided set linking sleep-duration metrics to PSS are small and inconsistent; thus these sleep features constitute a notable risk factor for elevated perceived stress but do not alone determine PSS placement.

Circadian and cardiac physiology: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics are generally consistent with a well-defined diurnal rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.55, Z ≈ +1.16), amplitude is elevated (13.6, Z ≈ +0.91), and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (≈4:14 PM). These features indicate a structured and regular circadian pattern across days; the dataset correlations show interdaily stability and amplitude to be modestly negatively associated with PSS (r ≈ -0.12 and r ≈ -0.17), which would be expected to relate to lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate is notably low (47 bpm, Z ≈ -1.33), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or chronically low autonomic arousal; its small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ +0.14) is weak and does not strongly suggest elevated stress. Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decreases and prominent daytime peaks (large positive deviation mid-morning and mid-afternoon), consistent with a robust day–night contrast rather than blunted diurnal variation.

Behavioral habits and social context: The participant reports regular socializing (1–2 hours daily) and minimal recreational drug use; alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week) is slightly above average. Exercise alone is reported as “not at all,” but exercise with others occurs 1–2 times/week. High self-reported trust (Z ≈ +1.15) and active social time are psychosocial resources that commonly buffer perceived stress; correlations provided for these items are small but generally in the direction that higher trust/social engagement associates with lower PSS.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress: Evidence is mixed but leans toward a lower-than-average perceived stress profile. Protective signals include low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction, structured circadian rhythms with relatively high interdaily stability and amplitude, robust day–night heart-rate contrast, low resting heart rate, and social engagement and trust. Risk signals include objectively short nightly sleep and a PSQI indicating disturbed subjective sleep; these sleep features are plausible contributors to elevated momentary strain and could raise perceived stress independent of trait measures. Given the relative weight of the measures and the directions/magnitudes of the available correlations with PSS, the preponderance of indicators point away from placement in the top half of the PSS distribution.

Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 43, Z = 0.17) is mildly above the sample mean; this measure has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), so the modestly elevated trait anxiety constitutes one source of risk for greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is on the borderline of disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified “Disturbed Sleep,” Z = -0.33), but this PSQI value is only slightly elevated and its z-score is below the group mean. Self-reported happiness is above average (score = 4, Z = 0.55) and general health satisfaction is somewhat below average (Z = -0.53). Substance use, recreational drug use, socializing time, and many leisure activities are low relative to the cohort (multiple Z-scores < -1), indicating limited engagement in some typical social or recreational outlets; correlations of these activity variables with PSS are small in this sample.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a well-structured, regular daily physiological pattern that is typically associated with lower perceived stress. Non-parametric circadian metrics indicate above-average interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and very high autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.62, Z = 2.49), while intradaily variability is low (0.36, Z = -1.31). Together these indicate consistent day-to-day timing of activity and heart rate, with relatively low fragmentation of rhythm; in the study correlations, higher regularity/autocorrelation tends to relate to lower PSS (autocorrelation r ≈ -0.18). Resting heart rate (61.2 bpm, Z = 0.36) and MESOR (78.49, Z = 0.62) are modestly above the cohort mean but show only small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.06–0.14), so their contribution to elevated perceived stress is likely minor. Hourly mean heart-rate deviations reflect the expected nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevation peaking in the mid-to-late afternoon (acrophase ≈ 4:14 PM); these diurnal patterns are coherent rather than erratic. Sleep metrics from the wearable show a median nightly duration of about 6 h 51 m (Z = -0.41) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 67 min, Z = -0.77) and a late median sleep onset around 00:47. Sleep quantity is slightly below the cohort mean and sleep timing is somewhat late, but there is no evidence of pronounced fragmentation or frequent napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86).

Weighing the convergent evidence, the profile supports a relatively lower-to-average level of perceived stress rather than a markedly elevated one. Supporting lower/average PSS are: below-average depressive symptoms, above-average happiness, strong and stable circadian organization (high interdaily stability and very high 24-hour autocorrelation), low intradaily variability, and low substance use and napping. Factors that could elevate perceived stress are limited: trait anxiety is mildly above average and sleep duration is slightly reduced with a marginally elevated PSQI score. Many correlations between wearable metrics and PSS in this sample are small in magnitude, and the largest objective protective signal here is the participant’s highly regular daily rhythm (autocorrelation Z = 2.49), which in this cohort is associated with lower perceived stress. On balance, the pattern of data—modest anxiety but overall low depressive symptoms, above-average self-reported happiness, and pronounced circadian regularity—more strongly favors placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution.

82986,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report profile — psychological symptoms, affect, and behavior:
The participant’s self-reported trait and symptom measures indicate relatively low levels of distress and a generally positive self-appraisal. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4; Z ≈ -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI = 25; Z ≈ -1.61) are well below the study mean, consistent with low recent depressive symptom burden and low chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem and momentary well-being indicators are relatively elevated (Rosenberg self-esteem Z ≈ +1.66; current happiness Z ≈ +1.64), and trust and health satisfaction are above average (trust Z ≈ +1.79; health satisfaction Z ≈ +0.8). Substance use is reported as none, socializing is modest (1–2 hours), and recreational screen or sedentary hobbies are low to average. Importantly, anxiety and depressive scores show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28), but because this participant’s scores are low on those measures, the self-report pattern points toward relatively low perceived stress compared with peers.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures — quantity, timing, and regularity:
Objective sleep and circadian-derived measures from the wearable show notable deviations from the study population. Median nocturnal sleep duration is very short (median 5 h 6 min; Z ≈ -2.6), and sleep onset is late on average (median start ≈ 02:24). Sleep timing variability is moderate (start-time SD ∼61 minutes; Z ≈ -0.48). Circadian regularity metrics indicate reduced day-to-day structure in heart-rate rhythms (interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.66), increased fragmentation within days (intradaily variability Z ≈ +0.46), low circadian amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -1.04), and modestly reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.45). Resting heart rate is somewhat elevated relative to peers (RHR = 66.8 bpm; Z ≈ +1.03). These objective markers (short sleep duration, late timing, lower stability/higher fragmentation, and raised resting HR) are commonly associated with physiological strain, disrupted recovery, and circadian misalignment — patterns that in other samples are linked to higher perceived stress and poorer health-related functioning. However, the sample correlations between these specific wearable metrics and PSS are small to modest (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16; RHR r ≈ 0.14), indicating that while these physiological features are risk-relevant, they are only weakly predictive of PSS variance in the broader cohort.

Hourly heart-rate pattern:
Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected overnight reduction in heart rate and daytime elevations; notable features include pronounced negative deviations in the very early morning (e.g., 3–6 AM) and several positive deviations during typical daytime and evening hours (peaks late morning through evening). The acrophase from cosinor analysis falls in the late afternoon (≈4:37 PM). These hourly deviations are consistent with a circadian rhythm that preserves nocturnal lowering of heart rate but with attenuated amplitude and increased daytime variation. Given the elevated resting HR and reduced amplitude, the hourly profile supports the interpretation of reduced autonomic contrast between sleep and wake periods — a physiological pattern that can reflect lower recovery or increased allostatic load, but which in this individual exists alongside low self-reported distress.

Integrated interpretation and likely perceived stress placement:
When weighing multimodal evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile. Self-report measures — which directly index experienced mood, anxiety, and subjective well-being and which covary moderately with PSS in this dataset — consistently indicate low symptom burden and relatively high self-regard and happiness. Objective physiology and sleep signals, in contrast, indicate short sleep duration, late and somewhat irregular sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude, greater intra-day fragmentation, and an elevated resting heart rate; these features are risk markers for stress-related physiological load and poorer recovery. In this sample the strongest predictors of PSS were the self-report affect and symptom scales (notably trait anxiety and depressive symptoms), and those scales are low for this participant. Wearable-derived risk signals here have only weak correlations with PSS across the cohort and therefore provide important contextual risk information but do not outweigh the direct self-reported indicators of low perceived stress. On balance — integrating low CES-D and STAI scores, elevated self-esteem and happiness, low substance use, and only modest behavioral/social disruption — the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

11402,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate elevated dispositional emotional risk factors that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 54, Z = 1.25) is meaningfully above the study mean and shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), suggesting that a stable tendency toward anxiety is likely to contribute to greater perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 17, Z = 0.38) is also above the sample mean and correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), reinforcing the expectation of greater perceived stress. Protective self-report indicators are limited: self-esteem is high (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and correlates weakly and negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), but this single positive trait appears insufficient to offset the elevated anxiety and depressive symptom signals.

Sleep and sleep-timing data present a pattern consistent with behavioral and circadian contributors to stress vulnerability. Objective wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 19 min; Z = -1.07) with large night-to-night variability (sleep start time SD ≈ 135 minutes; Z = 1.14), and the median sleep onset time is very late (≈ 03:17 AM). Shorter and more irregular sleep timing are risk markers for heightened perceived stress in this literature, and several of these sleep-timing measures show small positive correlations with PSS (e.g., sleep start time variability r ≈ 0.17). The self-reported PSQI score of 5 (Z = -0.8) sits at the typical clinical cutoff and indicates relatively acceptable subjective sleep quality, but the objective pattern of short, late, and variable sleep suggests physiological and behavioral sleep stressors not fully captured by self-report.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm metrics from the wearable point to elevated physiological load and atypical daily structure. The cardiac mesor (mean level) is elevated (MESOR = 83.48 bpm, Z = 1.30) and resting heart rate is modestly above average (63.4 bpm, Z = 0.62); both are positively associated with PSS to a small degree (mesor r ≈ 0.06; resting HR r ≈ 0.14). Hourly aggregated deviations show relatively higher heart rate during late-night and evening hours (e.g., 12–2 AM elevated; evening peaks around 6–8 PM with Z up to ~0.99), and pronounced morning troughs (large negative deviations early AM). Nonparametric circadian features indicate reduced regularity at the 24-hour scale (interdaily stability = 0.37, Z = -0.33; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ -1.03), and intradaily variability is lower than the sample average (Z = -1.45). Together these findings suggest an elevated mean cardiovascular tone with an atypical timing profile (late sleep/wake timing and lower day-to-day rhythmic regularity), a combination that is often associated with increased perceived stress and impaired recovery.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators show mixed signals but do not offset the weight of the risk indicators. The participant reports moderate alcohol use (beer 1–2x/week, Z = 1.01) and low recreational drug use. Exercise frequency is low-to-moderate (1–2x/week alone and with others), and sedentary recreational activities (video games, TV) are relatively high (video games Z = 2.47; TV Z = 1.28). Happiness and health satisfaction are slightly below average (happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.53) and correlate weakly in the expected direction with PSS. BMI is elevated (30.13), which can relate to physiological stress burden but shows only indirect relevance here. Overall, lifestyle markers provide neither strong protective nor strongly mitigating evidence against elevated perceived stress.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically, the balance favors classification in the higher half of the PSS distribution. Stronger evidence for elevated perceived stress includes substantially elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.25, r ≈ 0.31), above-average depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 0.38, r ≈ 0.28), objectively short and irregular sleep timing (median sleep duration Z = -1.07; median sleep start ~03:17 AM; high variability Z > 1.0), and elevated cardiovascular mesor and resting HR (MESOR Z = 1.30; resting HR Z = 0.62) with small positive correlations to PSS. Countervailing evidence (PSQI at the clinical cutoff indicating subjective sleep not markedly poor; high self-esteem) is modest and does not outweigh the convergent physiological and trait-affective indicators linked to higher perceived stress. On balance, the participant is more consistent with the top half of the study population on perceived stress.

38610,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant’s self-report profile is most consistent with relatively low subjective distress. Scores on validated symptom inventories are low: CES-D = 3 (Z = -1.07) and STAI–Trait = 28 (Z = -1.31), both well below the study mean and indicating low recent depressive symptoms and low trait anxiety relative to peers. Self‑esteem (Rosenberg) and momentary happiness are comparatively high (self‑esteem Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64), and reported overall health satisfaction is above average (Z = 1.13). Substance use is minimal and recreational drug use is absent, while social exercise frequency is high (exercising with others: Z = 1.23), all of which are behavioral signals that commonly accompany lower perceived stress. Taken together, these subjective and behavioral self‑report indicators provide convergent evidence of a low to average perceived stress profile.

Objective wearable-derived physiology and sleep metrics present a mixed picture that partially contrasts with the self-report data. Sleep quantity is notably short: median nightly sleep duration ~5 hours 46 minutes (Z = -1.76), and the median sleep start time is late (02:39 AM), suggesting a pronounced late sleep timing. Circadian/heart‑rate rhythm metrics show reduced amplitude (amplitude Z = -1.15) and somewhat lower interdaily stability (Z = -0.33) with modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.32), which together indicate a flattened and slightly fragmented heart‑rate rhythm across days. Resting heart rate and mesor are elevated (RHR = 67.7 bpm, mesor = 82.33; both Z = 1.14), consistent with higher baseline cardiovascular tone. These objective signals—short sleep, late timing, dampened circadian amplitude, and higher resting heart rate—are physiological or behavioral factors that often associate with greater chronic stress or circadian misalignment, even when subjective reports do not indicate high distress.

When integrating the modalities, the balance of evidence favors low perceived stress. The strongest and most direct indicators of perceived stress—the standardized self‑report measures related to mood, anxiety, self‑esteem, and momentary well-being—are all substantially below the study mean for negative symptoms and well above average for protective attributes. Objective markers raise potential concerns for physiological arousal and sleep insufficiency, which are risk factors for elevated stress over time; however, these signals show only modest correlations with PSS in the dataset and are not mirrored by increased depressive or anxiety symptom reporting. Given the clear, consistent pattern of low self‑reported symptom burden and positive psychosocial functioning combined with mixed but nondecisive physiological signals, the participant is most likely to fall in the lower half of the study population distribution for perceived stress.

96610,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report profile and affective indicators:
The participant’s questionnaire data show consistently low scores on symptom measures that commonly covary with perceived stress. The CES-D score (2.0, Z = -1.18) and trait anxiety (STAI = 25, Z = -1.61) are both well below the sample mean, indicating low recent depressive symptom burden and low chronic anxiety proneness. Self-report indices of positive functioning are relatively strong: an elevated self‑esteem score (RSES Z = 1.66), above-average momentary happiness (Current Happy Z = 1.64), and very high health satisfaction (7/7, Z = 2.05). Taken together, these self-reports point toward psychological resources (low negative affectivity, high self-regard, and good perceived health) that typically buffer against higher perceived stress.

Subjective sleep and daily habits:
Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59) indicates the participant endorses disturbed sleep despite objective sleep times that are only mildly below average. Leisure and substance-use behaviors are low: negligible alcohol and drug use and limited screen/time-based leisure, with modest social time (~31 minutes). Exercise behavior is mixed — low frequency of exercising alone but participation in sports 1–2 times per week — suggesting some physical activity but not large amounts. These lifestyle patterns are generally consistent with reduced exposure to common stress-amplifying behaviors (heavy substance use, high sedentary leisure) while the elevated PSQI signals a potential specific vulnerability related to perceived sleep quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns:
Fitbit-derived circadian metrics show relatively stable and structured heart-rate rhythms. Interdaily stability (0.51, Z = 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.41, Z = 0.73) are above average, and intradaily variability is near average (Z = -0.25), indicating a regular daily pattern of physiological activity rather than erratic fragmentation. MESOR and amplitude are somewhat elevated (MESOR Z = 0.92; Amplitude Z = 1.03) with an acrophase around 4:20 PM, reflecting a pronounced daytime heart-rate rhythm and clear daytime–nighttime separation. Resting heart rate is within a typical-to-lower range (60.8 bpm, Z = 0.32). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected large nocturnal declines in heart rate and afternoon peaks (notably 2–4 pm), consistent with intact circadian modulation of autonomic arousal. Overall, these objective physiological markers indicate regularity and robustness of circadian cardiovascular control rather than dysregulated arousal that often accompanies elevated chronic stress.

Objective sleep timing and variability:
Wearable-recorded median sleep duration is approximately 6 hours 53 minutes (Z = -0.37), mildly below the study mean but within a common collegiate range. Sleep onset is late (median start ~01:21 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 96 minutes, Z = -0.10). Nap frequency is low. The combination of late sleep timing and subjective reports of poor sleep (PSQI > 5) suggests the participant experiences perceived sleep problems despite relatively stable, moderately sufficient total sleep time. Because subjective sleep disturbance is a modest correlate of perceived stress, this element represents the primary behavioral/physiological risk factor in an otherwise low-risk profile.

Integration and implications for perceived stress:
Multiple converging signals point to a low-to-moderate level of perceived stress for this participant. Protective indicators include very low depressive and trait anxiety scores, high self-esteem and happiness, strong health satisfaction, limited substance use, and robust, regular circadian heart‑rate rhythms. The principal countervailing factor is subjective sleep disturbance and a late sleep schedule—an issue that can elevate perceived stress for some individuals—but objective sleep quantity and physiological rhythm measures do not show gross disruption. Correlations reported in the dataset (e.g., modest positive correlations between CES-D/STAI and PSS, negative correlations of self-esteem and regular circadian metrics with PSS) are aligned with this interpretation: the participant’s low symptom scores and strong circadian stability are protective, and the moderate PSQI elevation exerts only a limited offsetting influence.

Overall PSS ranking:
Using the available multimodal evidence and the population distribution (population mean PSS = 21.62, median = 22.0), the preponderance of indicators (very low depression and trait anxiety, high self-esteem/happiness, limited substance use, and well‑structured wearable-derived circadian rhythms) suggests the participant’s perceived stress would fall in the lower half of the study population (bottom 50%). The subjective sleep complaints introduce a modest upward pressure on perceived stress but do not outweigh the larger set of protective factors in the profile.

77711,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"Self-report profile and psychological traits:
The participant’s self-report profile shows mixed signals but leans toward elevated stress proneness. Trait anxiety (STAI) is relatively high (score 52; Z = +1.06), indicating a stable tendency toward anxiety that is positively associated with higher PSS in the study (STAI–PSS correlation ≈ 0.32). Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D is low–moderate (score 13; Z ≈ −0.03) and classified as “Not depressed,” which argues against marked mood symptoms driving stress reports. Self-esteem is low relative to the sample (Rosenberg score 28; Z = −1.43), a factor that in this cohort is modestly inversely related to PSS (correlation ≈ −0.16) and therefore may contribute to greater perceived stress vulnerability. Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7), which commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress; PSQI values above 5 are typically meaningful for sleep-related difficulties. Academic performance is high (GPAs near 4.0), and substance use is limited, both of which can act as buffers against stress but do not appear to negate the elevated trait anxiety and low self-esteem.

Behavioral habits and daily functioning:
Daily activities suggest substantial sedentary and solitary leisure time (watching videos 1–2 hours, listening to music 3–4 hours), limited participation in sports, and moderate social/exercise engagement (exercise 1–2 times/week alone or with others). These patterns point to some social and physical activity but also sizable passive leisure that may reflect coping strategies (distraction, media use). Health satisfaction and trust scores are slightly below average (Z ≈ −0.6 to −0.8), which could modestly reduce perceived social/health resources. Overall, behavioral data indicate a student maintaining strong academic performance and limited substance use but with lifestyle features (late sleep timing, passive leisure) that commonly accompany elevated perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian structure:
Wearable and subjective sleep metrics show a late and somewhat variable sleep schedule with slightly short median nightly sleep duration (median 6 h 55 m; Z ≈ −0.33) and a late median sleep start near 01:02 AM. Sleep start time and sleep-duration variability are nontrivial (SD of sleep start ≈ 55 minutes; SD of duration ≈ 70 minutes), and the PSQI indicates disturbed sleep subjectively. Circadian summary measures from heart rate show reduced overall regularity relative to the sample: interdaily stability is below average (value 0.34; Z ≈ −0.57) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is near average. Intradaily variability is slightly below average (Z ≈ −0.25). These features denote a circadian rhythm with modest day-to-day irregularity and modest fragmentation, patterns that in this dataset have small associations with higher PSS (interdaily stability correlation ≈ −0.12; intradaily variability correlation ≈ +0.16), consistent with the participant’s disturbed subjective sleep.

Physiological arousal and heart rate profile:
Resting heart rate is comparatively low (52.4 bpm; Z ≈ −0.68), a likely individual/fitness feature that reduces baseline cardiovascular arousal and does not strongly index perceived stress in this cohort (small positive correlation ≈ 0.13). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations from the mesor show deep nighttime declines (−16 to −20 bpm during 1–6 AM) and pronounced daytime peaks around midday/early afternoon (largest positive deviations at 1–2 PM: +17.8 bpm; Z ≈ +1.65). The timing of peak cardiac activity (acrophase ≈ 3:28 PM) and the midday elevations suggest a robust daytime activation pattern despite decreased interdaily stability. Correlations between several daytime heart-rate elevations and PSS tend to be slightly negative in this dataset, indicating that greater daytime heart-rate excursions are not a straightforward marker of higher perceived stress here; overall, physiological rhythms are structured but shifted and somewhat irregular.

Integration and implications for perceived stress (PSS):
Factors that support a relatively higher PSS classification include elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +1.06), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and late sleep timing with measurable variability, and low self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ −1.43). These measures have the most direct theoretical and empirical links to higher perceived stress and show nontrivial correlations with PSS in the sample. Factors that would support lower PSS include low depressive symptom scores, strong academic performance, limited substance use, substantial listening-to-music and media engagement (possible coping), and low resting heart rate. However, these buffering features appear secondary to the trait-anxiety/poor-sleep/self-esteem profile in terms of relevance to perceived stress. Wearable circadian features (reduced interdaily stability, moderate intradaily variability, and late acrophase) align with the self-reported sleep disturbance and, in aggregate, point toward lifestyle and physiological patterns commonly associated with elevated perceived stress.

Overall PSS group classification:
Weighing the evidence—particularly the elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, and low self-esteem, together with wearable indicators of circadian irregularity—the balance favors the participant having a PSS score in the higher half of the study population distribution (top 50%). Although some protective factors (low depressive symptoms, high GPA, low substance use) are present, they do not outweigh the stronger signals linked to elevated perceived stress in this profile.

17020,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Multimodal summary — self-report psychology and lifestyle:
The participant’s self-report profile presents a mixture of indicators. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 10, z = -0.34) and trait anxiety (STAI = 40, z = -0.13) are slightly below the study mean, and self-esteem is high (RSES = 40, z = +0.26). Those findings point toward relatively low-to-average internalizing symptomatology and preserved self-regard. At the same time, subjective sleep quality is worse than optimal (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep), and self-rated current happiness (z = -0.53) and health satisfaction (z = -0.78) are notably lower than the sample mean. Behavioral patterns indicate limited social time and low frequency of exercise alone, and relatively high daily internet use; these lifestyle features can reduce access to social buffering and physical-activity–related stress mitigation but in this dataset have only small correlations with PSS.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian features:
Objective sleep duration (median ~7 h 7 min, z = -0.08) is near the sample central tendency, but sleep timing is quite late (median sleep start ~02:12) and night-to-night sleep duration variability is elevated (SD = 108 minutes, z ≈ +0.17). The combination of late and variable sleep timing plus a self-reported PSQI > 5 suggests a subjective–objective mismatch: adequate aggregate sleep quantity but unstable and late timing that can undermine restorative sleep. Mean daily nap frequency is negligible. These sleep features have modest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset, indicating that the observed sleep irregularity could modestly elevate perceived stress but is not a large signal here.

Cardiovascular circadian and resting physiology:
Heart-rate circadian metrics show a low mesor (59.6 bpm, z ≈ -1.95) and low amplitude (z ≈ -1.21), together with a low resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, z ≈ -1.18). These values are consistent with generally low cardiovascular tone at rest (likely greater cardiovascular fitness or low baseline sympathetic drive) rather than heightened arousal. However, intradaily variability of the heart rate rhythm is relatively high (value 0.64, z ≈ +0.67), indicating greater fragmentation of the day–night structure of heart rate; this metric correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ +0.16). Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate and daytime peaks around midday, with an acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:51 PM), consistent with a preserved—though lower-amplitude—daytime rise. Overall, wearable physiology suggests low tonic arousal (lower resting HR and mesor) but some instability of day–night patterning (higher intradaily variability), a mixed signal for stress.

Integration and implications for perceived stress (PSS):
Balancing the signals, the strongest evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress is the participant’s below-average depressive and anxiety symptom scores and high self-esteem — measures that show moderate correlations with PSS in this dataset and are clinically meaningful for stress perception. Physiological indicators of low resting heart rate and low mesor also align with lower tonic physiological arousal. Countervailing evidence for elevated perceived stress is present but weaker: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), late and variable sleep timing, and higher intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythms have modest positive associations with higher PSS and could contribute to transient or context-dependent stress. Lifestyle indicators (limited socializing, low exercise frequency) are additional, small contributors to vulnerability but their correlations with PSS are small in the sample. Taken holistically, the dominant pattern is one of relatively low-to-average internal distress and low baseline physiological arousal, with secondary behavioral features (sleep irregularity, circadian fragmentation) that could incrementally raise perceived stress but do not outweigh the lower symptom burden.

Overall PSS-group classification:
Evidence for lower or average perceived stress (bottom half of the sample) — CES-D and STAI slightly below the population mean, high self-esteem, and low resting HR/mesor — is stronger than the evidence for elevated perceived stress (which rests mainly on subjective sleep disturbance, late/variable sleep timing, and increased intradaily variability, each with modest PSS correlations). On balance, the participant is more consistent with the bottom 50% of the study population on perceived stress.

29885,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Summary of self-report psychological traits and symptoms:
The participant reports a modest but notable burden of affective symptoms: a CES-D score of 17 (Z = 0.38) is above a commonly used screening threshold and shows a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), and trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) is likewise elevated and most strongly correlated with PSS in the available data (r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is relatively lower than the study mean (RSES = 33, Z = −0.73) and correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), indicating that lower self-regard co-occurs with higher perceived stress in the sample. Subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed (PSQI = 7, Z = 0.13), which is consistent with the self-report symptom set and can contribute to elevated perceived stress, although the PSQI z-score is only modestly above average.

Lifestyle and behavioral context:
The participant engages in frequent physical activity (exercising alone and with others three or more times per week; exercise Z-scores ≈ +1.1 to +1.2) and reports relatively high health satisfaction (5.56 on a 1–7 scale, Z = 0.97) and moderate current happiness (4.0, Z = 0.55). These positive lifestyle and well-being indicators are generally associated with lower stress in population-level correlations. Alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week, Z ≈ +0.9–1.0) is above the sample mean and sedentary hobby time is also elevated (Z = 1.41); however, correlations between these particular activity items and PSS are small in magnitude in the provided data. Overall, behavioral data present a mix of protective (frequent exercise, higher health satisfaction) and potentially stress-related (elevated substance use relative to peers, low self-esteem) elements.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian, and cardiovascular features:
Fitbit-derived metrics indicate a consistent, late sleep schedule and a physiologically robust circadian profile. Median sleep duration is just under 7 hours (6 h 56 m, Z = −0.31) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = −1.5; sleep start-time SD Z = −1.06), and median sleep onset is late (≈ 01:57). Heart-rate cosinor features show high amplitude (14.65, Z = +1.25), elevated interdaily stability (0.53, Z = +1.0), and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = +1.06), all consistent with a regular, high-amplitude circadian rhythm; these features correlate modestly with lower PSS in the sample (amplitude r ≈ −0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ −0.17). Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.2 bpm, Z = −0.59), which typically indexes favorable cardiovascular fitness and is associated with lower perceived stress here (though the correlation is modestly positive in the provided table, r ≈ 0.14 — note that the direction and magnitude of single correlations should be interpreted cautiously). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations overnight) and higher-than-average evening heart-rate deviations (notably 9–10pm), which may reflect late-evening activity or arousal consistent with the late sleep schedule. Overall, the objective data signal physiological resilience and schedule regularity, albeit aligned to a late chronotype.

Integration with perceived stress (PSS) and directional inference:
Indicators that most directly and consistently predict higher perceived stress in this dataset—namely elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety—are present at modestly above-average levels and have the largest positive correlations with PSS among available measures (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Subjective sleep disturbance and lower self-esteem add to this pattern. By contrast, several objective physiologic and behavioral measures (regular high-amplitude circadian rhythm, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and high health satisfaction) are features typically associated with lower perceived stress in the study and have modest negative correlations with PSS. The overall profile is therefore mixed: psychological self-report indicators point toward greater perceived stress while wearable-derived physiology and exercise/health satisfaction point toward mitigators of stress.

Holistic judgment about PSS group placement:
Weighing the relative salience of the measures, the participant’s above-threshold depressive symptoms and elevated trait anxiety—both of which correlate moderately with PSS and are proximal to perceived stress—suggest that the participant is more likely to report PSS values above the sample median. Although objective physiology and lifestyle indicators offer important protective signals, they do not fully counterbalance the psychological symptom signals that most directly reflect subjective stress experience. On balance, the evidence favors placement in the higher half of the PSS distribution (top 50%).

79167,10.0,0.010362694300518135,"Self-report profile: The participant reports a constellation of self-reported psychological and lifestyle indicators that largely align with lower perceived distress. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71) are well below the study mean, indicating infrequent depressive symptoms and low dispositional anxiety relative to peers. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (Rosenberg Z = 1.24; Happiness Z = 1.64), and satisfaction with physical health is high (Z = 2.05). Sleep quality by PSQI is on the favorable side (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) and academic performance (GPAs) is strong. The participant engages in frequent exercise and sports (three times/week or more; Z-scores ~1.07–1.58), reports modest social time (1–2 hrs) and limited sedentary recreational screen time. These self-report indices—low mood/anxiety, high self-esteem, good sleep quality, regular exercise, and high health satisfaction—are each consistent with relatively low perceived stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and cardiovascular baseline: Objective sleep metrics corroborate subjective reports: median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 11 m, Z = 1.25) with modest night-to-night variability (sleep-duration SD Z = -0.32), and no recorded naps (Z = -0.86). Resting heart rate is low relative to the sample (52.7 bpm, Z = -0.65), which commonly reflects better cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic sympathetic activation. Taken together, the sleep quantity and low resting HR support an interpretation of physiologic functioning typical of lower chronic stress.

Circadian structure and hourly heart-rate pattern: Heart-rate–based circadian features show mixed signals. Non-parametric regularity measures indicate reduced day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.28, Z = -1.07) and modestly elevated intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.65, Z = 0.74). Cosinor amplitude is relatively low (Amplitude = 7.58, Z = -1.03) while mesor is slightly below average (67.99, Z = -0.81). Hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced morning increases (especially 6–8 AM: 6–7 AM Z = 3.07, 7–8 AM Z = 2.69) and expected nocturnal reductions. The pattern suggests clear morning activation but a somewhat blunted overall amplitude and less stable day-to-day timing. Several of these circadian/ hourly features have small positive correlations with PSS (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.17; early-morning HR deviations r ≈ 0.22–0.23), indicating that greater fragmentation and higher early-morning cardiovascular reactivity are modestly associated with higher perceived stress in the sample. However, these correlations are small in magnitude.

Integration regarding perceived stress (PSS): Balancing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most consistent indicators point toward relatively low perceived stress. Low trait anxiety and depressive symptom burden, elevated self-esteem and happiness, robust sleep duration and quality, frequent exercise, and a low resting heart rate are each individually and collectively associated with lower PSS in most samples. The primary countervailing signals are reduced interdaily stability, increased intradaily variability, a blunted circadian amplitude, and modest associations of early-morning HR elevations with higher PSS; these suggest some irregularity in daily structure that can relate to elevated stress for some individuals. Nonetheless, the magnitude of those wearable-derived risk signals is modest (Z-scores generally near ±1 and correlation coefficients small), and they do not outweigh the stronger protective profile evident in the self-report and baseline physiological metrics.

Overall ranking of PSS score: Considering the full set of available indicators, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress is likely in the lower half of the study distribution (bottom 50%). Protective features (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem/happiness, good sleep duration and subjective sleep quality, frequent exercise, low resting HR) are prominent and of moderate-to-strong relative magnitude; circadian irregularities provide only small, partial contrary evidence.

22455,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"Self-report profile and behavioral habits: The participant’s questionnaire data show multiple indicators that align with relatively low perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) are below or near the study mean, self-reported happiness is relatively high (happy = 5.0, Z = 1.64), self-esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 1.10), and health satisfaction is high (Z = 1.96). These measures typically correlate with lower PSS in this sample (STAI and CES-D have moderate positive correlations with PSS of 0.32 and 0.29 respectively), so the pattern of low anxiety and low depressive symptoms supports placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Lifestyle variables are also consistent with a lower-stress profile in several respects: no reported use of alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs, regular solitary exercise (three or more times per week, Z = 1.07), and moderate social time (2–3 hours, Z = 0.95). Together, the self-report domain provides a coherent signal of relatively low perceived stress.

Sleep findings and their relevance to stress: Objective sleep from the wearable indicates shorter-than-average nocturnal sleep (median 6 hr 7 min, Z = -1.33) and moderately elevated night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 142 minutes, Z = 0.94). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5.0, Z = -0.8) sits near the border of commonly used cutoffs and is classified here as “Good Sleep.” Shorter sleep duration and higher variability are features that can be associated with higher perceived stress in the literature, and in this dataset sleep variability shows a small positive correlation with PSS (sleep duration SD correlation = 0.13). However, the participant’s subjective sleep rating and other self-report indices (low anxiety, high happiness) weaken a straightforward interpretation that sleep alone reflects elevated perceived stress. In sum, sleep metrics are a modest, mixed signal—some objective signs (shorter and more variable sleep) that could reflect stress-related sleep disruption, but not corroborated strongly by subjective distress measures.

Cardiovascular circadian structure and physiological arousal: Heart-rate–derived circadian measures indicate a relatively low average cardiac level (mesor = 66.3 bpm, Z = -1.04; resting HR = 53.8 bpm, Z = -0.52) and reduced amplitude of the 24-hour rhythm (amplitude = 6.07, Z = -1.52). Lower amplitude and reduced interdaily stability (interdaily stability Z = -0.9) point to a blunted and less regular circadian pattern; amplitude in this sample is negatively correlated with PSS (corr = -0.16), suggesting that reduced amplitude can be associated with higher perceived stress. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (IV = 0.59, Z = 0.32) and correlates positively with PSS (corr = 0.16), again providing a small physiological signal that aligns with greater stress-related disruption. The hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced morning increases in heart rate (notably 5–6am: +24 bpm, Z = 6.2; 6–7am: +14 bpm, Z = 4.31), which are outliers relative to the population and likely reflect consistent morning activity (e.g., exercise) rather than chronic sympathetic hyperarousal. Overall the cardiac data present a mixed picture: generally low resting levels but reduced day–night contrast and modestly elevated rhythm fragmentation—physiological features that can be seen with higher stress but here appear mild-to-moderate and may partially reflect behavioral patterns (morning exercise).

Integrated interpretation with respect to perceived stress (PSS): The self-report and behavioral data form the strongest set of indicators and point toward relatively low perceived stress: notably low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, no substance use, and frequent exercise. Objective physiology and sleep provide a secondary, mixed signal—shorter and more variable sleep plus reduced circadian amplitude and slightly increased intradaily variability are changes that, in isolation, can align with higher perceived stress, but their effect sizes here are small-to-moderate (z-scores mostly within ±1.5) and are not strongly reinforced by subjective distress measures. Correlational guidance in the dataset indicates that the most predictive self-report constructs for PSS (STAI and CES-D) are low for this participant, whereas wearable-derived markers show only modest associations with PSS in this sample. Balancing these sources, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the study population’s PSS distribution.

57443,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Self-report measures show a mixed but generally not extreme profile with respect to affective symptoms and psychological resources. The participant’s CES-D score (19; z = 0.59) indicates an elevated level of depressive symptoms relative to the sample mean, and CES-D is positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), which suggests depressive symptom burden could contribute to higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 40; z ≈ -0.13) is near the sample average and only slightly below the mean, with STAI also moderately positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Protective self-report indicators include relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 39; z = 0.11) and above-average current happiness (rating 4.0; z = 0.55), both of which show negative correlations with PSS (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15, happiness r ≈ -0.19). Lifestyle and health self-reports (healthy BMI ≈ 21.2, high health satisfaction z ≈ 0.22, minimal substance use, limited napping) point toward relatively adaptive health behaviors that typically associate with lower perceived stress.

Objective wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics further support a pattern of physiological regularity and resilience. Circadian non-parametric and cosinor features are elevated or robust relative to the sample: interdaily stability is above average (value 0.50; z ≈ 0.75), autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (value 0.46; z ≈ 1.15), and amplitude from cosinor is above average (12.91; z ≈ 0.69). These markers of stable and rhythmic heart-rate patterns have small negative correlations with PSS (e.g., autocorrelation r ≈ -0.18, amplitude r ≈ -0.17), indicating that the participant’s stronger daily structure is the type of physiological profile typically associated with lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate and MESOR are modestly above average (RHR = 61.2 bpm, MESOR ≈ 80.2; z-scores ≈ 0.36 and 0.85 respectively), but their correlations with PSS are small (RHR r ≈ 0.14, MESOR r ≈ 0.06) and do not outweigh the broader pattern of circadian robustness.

Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations and sleep behavior are consistent with healthy diurnal patterning. The hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations overnight) and clear daytime increases with peaks in early afternoon and early evening; several daytime peaks have positive z-scores relative to the sample (e.g., 1–3 pm z > 1.3–1.6), indicating normal pronounced wake-phase activity. Median nightly sleep duration (~7 h 14 min; z ≈ 0.06) and a PSQI score at the conventional boundary (PSQI = 5; z ≈ -0.8, classified here as “Good Sleep”) indicate adequate and subjectively satisfactory sleep. Importantly, sleep timing variability is low (sleep duration SD 42 min; z ≈ -1.33), and sleep start-time variability is near average, which together point to regular sleep/wake timing—features that are generally associated with reduced perceived stress (sleep regularity shows small inverse relations with PSS in the dataset).

Integrative assessment weighing self-report and wearable evidence: indicators that would push toward elevated perceived stress are present but limited in magnitude (notably the CES-D elevation and small positive associations between negative affect measures and PSS). In contrast, multiple converging indicators that typically correspond with lower perceived stress are stronger and more consistent: robust circadian stability and amplitude, regular and sufficient sleep, minimal substance use, reasonable physical health and social engagement, and moderately high happiness and self-esteem. The directional correlations supplied with the features generally show that the participant’s stronger circadian and sleep metrics are linked to lower PSS, while the participant’s modest depressive symptoms and near-average anxiety provide only moderate countervailing evidence. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence favors the participant being in the lower half of the sample distribution for perceived stress (i.e., bottom 50th percentile).

94579,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant endorses elevated affective symptomatology relative to the study sample, with a CES-D score of 24 (z ≈ +1.1) and a trait anxiety (STAI-T) score of 44 (z ≈ +0.27). Both scales have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), indicating that these mood and anxiety indicators are likely to covary with higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is slightly below the sample mean (Rosenberg = 37, z ≈ −0.17), and momentary happiness ratings are also below average (current happiness z ≈ −0.53); these self-evaluative measures have modest negative correlations with PSS in the cohort (higher self-esteem and happiness tend to accompany lower PSS), so the lower scores here are additional, though smaller, signals consistent with greater perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: The participant reports frequent physical activity (multiple exercise and sport items at “three times a week or more,” z-scores ~+1.1 to +1.6), and substantial time in solitary cognitive activity (reading reported at 2–3 hours with an extreme z ≈ +4.2). Regular exercise and time spent reading are associated in the sample with slightly lower perceived stress (small negative correlations). Alcohol and recreational drug use are minimal, and health satisfaction is above average (z ≈ +0.55), both of which are factors that would tend to mitigate perceived stress. Social activity and internet/media use are above average but show only weak correlations with PSS in the sample. Overall, lifestyle measures present a mixture of protective (regular exercise, low substance use, higher health satisfaction, extensive reading) and risk-related patterns (lower subjective happiness, elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms).

Sleep and sleep variability: Objective wearable sleep duration is somewhat shorter than average (median ≈ 6 h 38 m, z ≈ −0.69), and the participant exhibits markedly high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 242 minutes, z ≈ +3.2) and in sleep start times (median start ≈ 02:07, start-time SD z ≈ +1.54). Although the subjective PSQI score (5) classifies overall sleep as relatively good and is slightly better than the cohort mean (z ≈ −0.8), the large objective variability in timing and duration has a positive association with PSS in the study (sleep variability correlations ≈ +0.17–0.18). The combination of late typical sleep onset, high inconsistency in sleep timing, and somewhat short average sleep suggests behavioral sleep irregularity that, in this dataset, relates to elevated perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a reasonably stable 24‑hour structure (interdaily stability z ≈ +0.67; autocorrelation at 24 h z ≈ +0.48) and normal-to-low resting physiology (resting HR ≈ 57.6 bpm, z ≈ −0.07). Higher interdaily stability and larger amplitude are modestly associated with lower PSS in the sample (correlations ≈ −0.11 to −0.16), and this participant shows values consistent with relatively intact circadian rhythmicity (amplitude z ≈ +0.39; acrophase ~4:17 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor reflect expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations without pronounced atypical arousal peaks. These circadian and cardiovascular features are more consistent with lower perceived stress or resilience to stressors relative to someone with disrupted rhythms or elevated resting HR.

Synthesis and PSS-group inference: The profile is mixed but leans toward higher perceived stress. Stronger indicators pointing toward elevated PSS are the notably raised depressive symptom score (CES-D z ≈ +1.1) and the elevated trait anxiety score; both measures have the largest positive correlations with PSS in the available data. Contributing risk signals also include low subjective happiness and very large objective sleep variability and late average sleep timing—each of which associates with higher PSS in the study. Countervailing evidence includes frequent exercise, minimal substance use, relatively high health satisfaction, substantial calming/engaged leisure (reading), and fairly intact circadian stability and low resting heart rate, all of which are linked to lower PSS or resilience. Given the relatively strong association of mood and anxiety symptoms with perceived stress and the participant’s elevated scores on those instruments, the overall balance of evidence supports classification in the upper half of the distribution for perceived stress in this sample.

29257,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports very low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 2, Z = -1.18; STAI-Trait = 31, Z = -1.02), and relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.1). Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26). Health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.72) and objective academic performance (GPA) is solid. These self-report features that most strongly map onto perceived stress (notably low CES-D and low STAI-T scores, both of which correlate positively with PSS in the cohort) collectively indicate lower reported negative affect and greater perceived capacity to manage daily demands than the average participant.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: The participant engages in modest alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) and minimal drug use, exercises occasionally (1–2×/week), and reports unusually high time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours/day, Z = 2.06). Recreational screen time and socializing are below average. Most of these behavioral markers show small or inconsistent correlations with PSS in the sample (correlation coefficients near zero), so they are unlikely to be primary drivers of elevated perceived stress here; the combination of low anxiety/depression and relatively stable health satisfaction weighs more heavily.

Wearable sleep and cardiac physiology: Nightly sleep duration is adequate on median (7 h 49 m, Z = 0.79) and there are no recorded daytime naps (Z = -0.86). However, sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 01:32 AM) and night-to-night sleep duration is variable (SD ≈ 151 minutes, Z = 1.14). Subjective sleep quality and total sleep time point toward sufficient sleep quantity and perceived restorative sleep, but the high variability in duration and late sleep timing suggest some irregularity in sleep scheduling. Resting heart rate is modestly low/normal (59.2 bpm, Z = 0.12), which is consistent with low baseline autonomic arousal.

Circadian and heart-rate patterning: Cosinor and nonparametric circadian metrics indicate reduced interdaily stability (0.26, Z = -1.23) and reduced amplitude (8.46, Z = -0.75), alongside a measurable 24-hour autocorrelation (0.42, Z = 0.81). In aggregate these features describe a rhythm that preserves a 24-hour structure but with lower day-to-day regularity and somewhat blunted amplitude of heart-rate fluctuation. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nighttime nadir (largest negative deviations in early morning) and daytime elevations around midday to mid-afternoon; these hourly patterns do not in themselves suggest sustained sympathetic overactivation. Several circadian irregularity measures (interdaily stability negative correlation with PSS, sleep-duration variability and sleep start variability small positive correlations with PSS) are associated in the cohort with modest increases in perceived stress, but the effect sizes are small.

Integration and evidence synthesis regarding perceived stress: The strongest and most directly relevant indicators for perceived stress in this profile are the very low CES-D and STAI-Trait scores and the favorable PSQI and self-esteem measures; these variables have the largest conceptual and empirical links to PSS and all point toward lower perceived stress relative to the sample. Contrasting signals include circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability, high night-to-night sleep variability, late bedtimes) and some markers that have small positive correlations with PSS; these suggest potential situational or behavioral contributors to strain but are relatively weak predictors in magnitude. Physiological resting indices (resting HR near sample mean, preserved day–night HR pattern) do not show patterns consistent with chronically elevated physiological stress. Overall, the preponderance and magnitude of evidence—particularly the low depression/anxiety scores and good subjective sleep—support classification in the lower half of the cohort for perceived stress.

49539,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report profile — psychological traits and lifestyle:
The participant’s self-report measures consistently indicate low internalizing symptom burden and generally positive psychosocial resources. CES-D (score = 3; Z = -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI = 23; Z = -1.81) are well below the study mean, which points to minimal recent depressive symptoms and low chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES Z = 0.96) and health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.8). Substance use is absent across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs. Academic performance (rising GPAs across terms) and low engagement with sedentary or potentially avoidant leisure (very low TV/gaming, modest internet use) further indicate preserved functioning and limited behavioral markers of high perceived stress. The PSQI score of 6 crosses the common clinical cutoff for disturbed sleep but is only slightly elevated; combined with a median sleep duration of ~7 h 20 min (Z = 0.18) this suggests subjective sleep complaints that are modest in magnitude relative to other indicators.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure:
Cardiovascular and circadian metrics show a mixed pattern. Resting heart rate and overall mesor are low (RHR 47.8 bpm, Z = -1.23; mesor Z = -1.57), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic autonomic arousal. Nighttime hourly deviations show expected nocturnal heart rate suppression (largest negative deviations between ~2–8 AM), while daytime hours show elevated deviations from mesor consistent with activity. One hourly aggregate (11–12 AM) is an extreme positive outlier relative to the sample (deviation Z = 4.79); this appears as an isolated large amplitude in the aggregated hourly profile and has a small negative correlation with PSS in this dataset, so it should be treated cautiously as a measurement or behavior-related artifact rather than a clear stress indicator. Circadian regularity metrics are somewhat divergent: interdaily stability is modestly above average (Z = 0.75) indicating reasonably consistent day-to-day timing, but intradaily variability is markedly elevated (IV Z = 2.01), indicating pronounced within-day fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:45 AM) but relatively consistent night-to-night (sleep start SD ≈ 39 minutes, Z ≈ -0.96), and nap frequency is essentially zero. Several of the wearable features (IV positive; interdaily stability negative) have small correlations with PSS in the expected directions (greater fragmentation relates to higher PSS), but these associations are modest in magnitude.

Synthesis regarding perceived stress:
Weighing self-report and physiological evidence, the preponderance of indicators points toward relatively low or average perceived stress for this participant. The strongest and most direct predictors of perceived stress in this dataset — low CES-D and STAI scores and elevated self-esteem — consistently suggest below-average stress. Objective physiology largely supports low tonic arousal (low resting HR and mesor), and sleep quantity is adequate on average. Countervailing signals include a mildly elevated PSQI (subjective sleep disturbance) and a pronounced measure of circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = 2.01), which are associated with higher perceived stress in prior work and show small positive correlations with PSS here. The participant’s late but consistent sleep timing and low daytime socializing are additional contextual factors that could modestly increase situational stress vulnerability but do not outweigh the stronger low-anxiety/low-depression self-report profile. On balance — considering effect sizes, Z-scores, and the directionality of associations with PSS — the overall pattern is more consistent with placement in the lower half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

63904,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Psychological symptom profile and self-report indicators:
The participant reports elevated affective symptomatology: a CES-D score of 30 (Z = +1.74) and a trait anxiety score of 53 (Z = +1.16). Both scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), indicating that higher depressive and anxious symptoms in this individual are the kinds of features that tend to accompany greater perceived stress. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 30, Z ≈ −1.15) and self-rated happiness is low (score 2.0, Z ≈ −1.61); both of these features have weak negative correlations with PSS in the cohort, consistent with the pattern of greater distress co-occurring with lower positive self-appraisals. Trust is unusually low (Z ≈ −2.07), which may reflect reduced perceived social resources; trust has a small negative correlation with PSS in the sample but, in combination with elevated mood and anxiety symptoms, it strengthens the case for higher perceived burden.

Sleep and daily routine: objective wearable sleep metrics show a short median nightly sleep duration of about 5 hours 49 minutes (Z ≈ −1.69), with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 30 minutes, Z ≈ −1.61) and a late median sleep onset around 01:34. The subjective sleep quality score (PSQI = 6) exceeds the common cutoff for disturbed sleep and is consistent with the brief objective sleep. Short sleep and subjective sleep disturbance are commonly associated with poorer stress regulation and mood; although the direct correlation of median sleep duration with PSS in this sample is small, the combination of objectively short sleep and subjectively disturbed sleep is a clinically meaningful pattern that typically co-occurs with elevated perceived stress.

Activity, health behaviors, and academic functioning:
Behavioral data show little engagement in exercise or recreational substance use (exercise responses Z-scores strongly negative; no alcohol/drug use). The participant reports socializing for 2–3 hours daily, and academic performance is strong (GPAs 3.83–3.86), which may reflect active social and academic involvement despite other difficulties. Low exercise and very low trust could limit coping resources for stress, while high academic performance suggests functioning is maintained in a performance domain even as mood and anxiety symptoms are elevated.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns:
Circadian metrics indicate relatively high daily regularity in heart-rate rhythms: interdaily stability ≈ 0.53 (Z ≈ +1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours ≈ 0.45 (Z ≈ +1.06), implying a consistent day-to-day schedule despite late bedtimes and short sleep. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.63, Z ≈ +0.6), suggesting some fragmentation of activity within days. Resting heart rate is within a normal range (≈ 60.5 bpm, Z ≈ +0.28); overall mesor and amplitude values are near-sample-average. Hourly deviations from mesor show typical nocturnal reductions in overnight heart rate and peaks in the late morning and late afternoon; a pronounced positive deviation around 8–9 AM (≈ +11 bpm, Z ≈ +1.58) may reflect morning activation or demanding morning routines. Several heart-rate features (intradaily variability, resting HR) have small positive correlations with PSS in the cohort, consistent with modest physiological arousal patterns accompanying higher perceived stress.

Synthesis regarding perceived stress:
Converging evidence weighs toward elevated perceived stress. The strongest contributors are the clearly elevated depressive and trait anxiety scores—both of which have the largest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset—and the constellation of low self-esteem, low happiness, and low interpersonal trust. Objective sleep is short and subjective sleep quality is disturbed, a combination that commonly amplifies perceived stress and impairs emotion regulation. Countervailing signals that could indicate lower stress include a relatively high daily regularity of heart-rate rhythms, stable (low-variability) sleep durations, absence of substance use, and preserved high academic performance; these suggest that the participant maintains structured routines and functional performance despite affective symptoms. Overall, however, the balance of evidence (symptom elevations most strongly associated with PSS, plus short/disturbed sleep and some indications of physiological activation) supports assignment to the higher half of the cohort distribution for perceived stress.

20335,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Psychological self-report and behavioral habits. The survey profile shows low reported symptom burden across mood and anxiety measures: the CES-D score is very low (Z = -1.18) and trait anxiety is also low (STAI Z = -1.81). Subjective well-being indicators are elevated relative to the sample: self-reported happiness and self-esteem are both substantially above average (happiness Z ≈ 1.64; self-esteem Z = 1.66), and overall health satisfaction is high (Z = 1.3). Leisure and social habits indicate frequent socializing (socializing Z = 1.74) and time spent in sedentary hobbies (Z = 2.01), with regular solo exercise (exercising alone Z = 1.07). Alcohol use is modest and recreational drug use is absent. These self-report signals—especially low depressive and anxiety scores together with high happiness and self-esteem—are each associated in the study with lower PSS values or show negative correlations with PSS in the provided correlation table (e.g., happiness r ≈ -0.19, self-esteem r ≈ -0.15), supporting an overall low-to-average perceived stress profile.

Sleep timing and quantity. Wearable-derived sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 h 35 min (Z ≈ -0.74), shorter than the sample mean but within a modest range. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is near the threshold but classified as “Good Sleep” (PSQI = 5; Z ≈ -0.8), and night-to-night variability in sleep start time is relatively low (sleep-start SD Z ≈ -1.24), indicating a consistent—but late—sleep schedule (median sleep start ≈ 01:54). In combination, these data describe a consistent late chronotype with slightly reduced total sleep time but generally preserved subjective sleep quality; the sleep measures have weak correlations to PSS in the dataset, so their contribution to perceived stress is likely limited and mixed.

Cardiovascular circadian structure and activity patterns. Heart-rate-derived circadian metrics indicate a largely regular and robust rhythm: interdaily stability is relatively high (Z ≈ 1.33) and autocorrelation at 24 h is elevated (Z ≈ 0.9), while amplitude is higher-than-average (Z ≈ 0.9) and acrophase is in the early evening (~6:06 PM). These parametric and nonparametric features (higher interdaily stability and amplitude) are associated with lower PSS in the provided correlations (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.16; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17), suggesting structured daily physiology consistent with lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate is low (55 bpm; Z ≈ -0.37), which in this sample correlates modestly with lower PSS (resting HR r ≈ 0.14; here the negative deviation indicates lower arousal). Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z ≈ 0.81) and correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), suggesting some within-day fragmentation that could modestly elevate stress risk; however the stronger, opposite-sign signals from interdaily stability and amplitude argue for a more resilient circadian profile overall.

Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations and potential late-night arousal. The hourly aggregated deviations show the expected overnight troughs across most early-morning hours (large negative deviations between ~2–7 AM). There is an unusually large positive deviation at 12–1 AM (Z ≈ 3.66), and elevated evening peaks around 6–7 PM (Z ≈ 1.35) and late evening (10–12 PM Z > 1.1). The midnight positive deviation could reflect late-night activity or an outlier in aggregated data; its correlation with PSS is small (r ≈ -0.07) and thus provides limited evidence regarding perceived stress. Overall, evening activity peaks and preserved nocturnal dips align with the participant’s late but consistent schedule and do not provide strong evidence of elevated perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress. Multiple convergent indicators point toward relatively low-to-average perceived stress for this participant. Low depressive and trait anxiety scores, high happiness and self-esteem, high circadian regularity and amplitude, and a low resting heart rate each are associated with lower PSS in this sample or show negative correlations with PSS. Countervailing signals are modest: somewhat shorter sleep duration than the sample mean and modest intraday variability in heart rate could increase stress vulnerability in isolation, but their correlations with PSS are small and are outweighed by the stronger signals suggesting lower stress. Taken holistically, the balance of psychological self-report, behavioral patterns, and wearable-derived physiological structure supports a conclusion that this participant’s PSS score would fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

35031,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report psychological measures indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and some protective psychosocial characteristics. The participant’s CES-D score (6; Z = -0.76) and STAI–Trait score (27; Z = -1.41) are both well below the sample mean and are classified as “not depressed” and “not anxious,” respectively. Rosenberg self-esteem is above average (score Z = 0.68), and subjective health satisfaction is near the population mean (Z = 0.13). Subjective happiness and trust are slightly below average (happiness Z = -0.53; trust Z = -0.46), but these deviations are modest. Taken together, the self-report profile points toward relatively low reported internalizing symptoms and reasonably preserved self-regard, which—given the positive correlations of depressive and anxious symptoms with perceived stress—favors a lower perceived stress level.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features show evidence of physiological irregularity and elevated basal cardiac tone. Circadian regularity metrics are attenuated: interdaily stability is low (0.19; Z = -1.81) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.10; Z = -1.87), while intradaily variability is elevated (0.71; Z = 1.16), indicating day-to-day irregularity and fragmented within-day structure in heart-rate signals. Cosinor amplitude is reduced (5.05; Z = -1.85) even though the MESOR is higher than average (82.2; Z = 1.13). Resting heart rate is substantially elevated relative to the sample (75.5 bpm; Z = 2.06). These physiological features (particularly higher resting heart rate and greater intradaily variability) have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (resting HR r ≈ 0.15; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), suggesting that the participant’s autonomic/physiological profile carries modest risk for higher perceived stress even if subjective reports do not reflect high stress.

Sleep behavior recorded by the wearable is generally sufficient in duration but somewhat late and moderately variable. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 3 min; Z = 1.08), and nap frequency is low (mean 0.14 naps/day; Z = 0.82). Median sleep start time is shortly after midnight (00:16) with a sleep-onset standard deviation of ~96 minutes (Z = 0.28), indicating some variability in bedtimes. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; Z = -0.8) is at the threshold of “good sleep” and aligns with the objective finding of adequate total sleep time. Sleep-related metrics show weak correlations with perceived stress in this dataset, and on balance these sleep parameters are more consistent with relatively low-to-average perceived stress than with marked stress-related insomnia.

Behavioral habits show mixed signals but include protective social engagement and moderate alcohol use. The participant reports socializing 2–3 hours (Z = 0.95), which can be buffering for stress. Exercise frequency is modest (exercising alone and with others ~1–2 times per week; Zs around 0.3–0.5) and sports participation has a higher relative value (Z = 0.91). Alcohol use is occasional (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Zs ≈ 1.0). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. These lifestyle patterns—regular social contact, modest physical activity, and limited substance use—are generally consistent with lower perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and PSS ranking: psychological self-reports (low depression and anxiety, above-average self-esteem), adequate sleep duration and social engagement provide convergent evidence for a relatively low or average level of perceived stress. Contrastingly, wearable physiology indicates elevated resting heart rate and circadian irregularity, which are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample and could reflect either subclinical autonomic activation or lower cardiovascular fitness rather than subjective stress per se. Weighing the stronger, direct indicators of subjective affect (CES-D, STAI, self-esteem) and lifestyle buffers against the more circumscribed physiological signals, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress (PSS) is more likely to fall in the lower or median half of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

88185,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report measures collectively indicate relatively low concurrent affective symptom burden and favorable self-regulatory resources. Scores on the CES-D (7) and the trait STAI (29) are both well below the study mean (Z-scores -0.66 and -1.22 respectively), consistent with low depressive symptom frequency and low trait anxiety. Self-reported happiness and self-esteem are above the sample mean (happiness Z = 1.64; self-esteem Z = 0.82), and academic performance is high (GPAs near the top of the scale). These self-report indices point toward a psychological profile characterized by positive mood, stable self-regard, and limited affective distress during the sampling period — factors typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Lifestyle and behavioral data further align with lower perceived stress risk. The participant reports essentially no substance use, regular individual exercise (three times per week or more, Z = 1.07), and moderate social engagement (2–3 hours, Z = 0.95). Recreational patterns show substantial time listening to music (Z = 2.06) and low engagement in potentially stress-related sedentary or gaming activities. Health satisfaction is slightly below the mean (Z = -0.53), and PSQI indicates borderline disturbed sleep (score = 6), but the overall behavioral profile suggests active coping resources and limited behavioral risk exposures that would typically elevate perceived stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate a robust, regular circadian structure and physiologic profiles consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and diurnal regulation. Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms is relatively high (value 0.57, Z = 1.33), amplitude of the fitted rhythm is elevated (Z = 1.06), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (Z = 0.56), all of which reflect consistent daily structure. Resting heart rate is low-normal (57.3 bpm, Z = -0.10), and cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude reflect a clear day–night contrast. Aggregated hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal heart-rate nadir and daytime elevations, with an acrophase around 5:00 PM. These features (notably higher interdaily stability and amplitude) have small negative correlations with PSS in the sample, aligning with lower perceived stress.

Sleep-derived metrics present mixed signals but are not strongly indicative of elevated perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration (~6 h 37 min; Z = -0.7) is somewhat shorter than the sample mean and the median sleep start time is late (approx. 02:25), suggesting a delayed sleep schedule. However, sleep duration variability is relatively low (SD 62 minutes, Z = -0.87) and naps are absent, indicating consistent sleep quantity across days despite a late onset. PSQI is marginally above the common clinical cutoff, indicating some subjective sleep disturbance, but objective circadian regularity and low variability mitigate the likely impact of reduced sleep duration on stress perception in this case.

Integrative interpretation regarding perceived stress: multiple convergent indicators point toward a relatively low-to-moderate perceived stress profile. Low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, strong academic performance, low-risk lifestyle behaviors, and robust circadian regularity all favor placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. The main countervailing elements are marginally short sleep duration, late sleep timing, and a PSQI score indicating some subjective sleep disturbance; these could increase perceived stress risk in other contexts but do not appear, in this participant, to be accompanied by elevated affective symptoms or physiological dysregulation. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports classification in the bottom half of the study population with respect to PSS.

Scores on the CES-D (28, Z = 1.53) and the STAI–Trait (62, Z = 2.05) are well above the study mean and are the most prominent psychometric signals; both of these scales show positive correlations with PSS in the cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), suggesting these features are relevant predictors of higher perceived stress. Concurrently, self-esteem is relatively low (Rosenberg 27, Z = −1.57) and current self-reported happiness is low (2.0, Z = −1.61); these measures have modest negative correlations with PSS in the sample and are consistent with the pattern of elevated affective symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: Several health behaviors show mixed signals. The participant reports regular solo exercise (≥ three times/week; Z ≈ 1.07) and maintains strong academic performance (GPA consistently high), which are factors sometimes associated with lower perceived stress or better coping capacity. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Social and recreational engagement appears limited (minimal time socializing, low engagement in music, reading, or sedentary hobbies; multiple Z-scores well below the mean), which may reduce social buffering resources. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z ≈ 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep), despite objective sleep duration being slightly above average.

Objective sleep and circadian metrics: Wearable-derived sleep metrics show median nightly duration near 7 hours 47 minutes (Z = 0.74) and relatively low day-to-day sleep timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 61 minutes, Z ≈ −0.48). The discrepancy between subjective (PSQI) and objective sleep (adequate duration, low variability) suggests the participant perceives their sleep as poor even though Fitbit-derived duration and regularity are not strongly deviant. Napping is essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z ≈ −0.86). These patterns indicate preserved sleep opportunity and timing regularity but subjective sleep disturbance, a combination commonly observed in individuals reporting elevated stress or affective symptoms.

Physiological rhythm and autonomic indicators: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics are broadly within a normal range relative to the study sample but modestly shifted toward greater daytime cardiovascular tone. Mesor (78.0 bpm, Z ≈ 0.56) and resting heart rate (63.8 bpm, Z ≈ 0.67) are slightly above average and have small positive correlations with PSS in the cohort (resting HR r ≈ 0.14). Hourly deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and daytime elevations (acrophase ≈ 3:51 PM; daytime hourly deviations up to ~13 bpm above mesor). Nonparametric circadian measures (interdaily stability and intradaily variability) are near the sample mean (Z-scores close to 0), indicating a reasonably regular 24-hour structure with no marked fragmentation. Overall, autonomic signals suggest mild sympathetic predominance during the day but not extreme circadian disruption.

Integrated interpretation and PSS placement: Weighing multimodal evidence, the strongest signals point toward elevated perceived stress. The most salient contributors are high trait anxiety and elevated depressive symptom scores—both robustly associated with higher PSS in this population—together with low self-esteem and low reported happiness. Subjective sleep disturbance, despite objectively adequate sleep duration, further aligns with higher perceived stress. Factors that could buffer stress (frequent exercise, strong academic performance, regular circadian rhythm and sufficient sleep duration) are present but appear insufficient to offset the pronounced internalizing symptomatology and low social engagement. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s PSS score would fall in the upper half of the study distribution (top 50%).

31175,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but overall resilient psychological profile. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 12, z ≈ -0.14) is low relative to the sample, while trait anxiety (STAI = 40, z ≈ -0.13) is near the sample mean rather than elevated. Self-esteem appears above average (Rosenberg-like score with z = 0.4). The participant reports substantial social engagement (3–4 hours/day; z = 1.74) and frequent individual exercise (three times/week or more; z = 1.07), both behaviors typically associated with better stress coping. Alcohol is consumed at a moderate weekly frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; z ≈ 0.9–1.0) and non-prescribed/recreational drug use is absent. Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 8, z = 0.59), and current self-reported happiness is somewhat below the mean (z = -0.53), which indicate some perceived difficulties despite other positive traits.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics show long median sleep duration (median ~9 h 34 min; z = 2.96) but very large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 249 minutes; z = 3.37). Median sleep start time is around 23:17 with modest variability. The combination of extended average sleep time and extreme variability suggests irregular sleep patterns that may undermine subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning despite a long average duration. Napping is minimal, so the variability appears concentrated in nocturnal sleep timing/length rather than compensatory daytime sleep.

Cardiovascular and circadian features point to relatively low physiological arousal and a broadly coherent daily rhythm. Resting heart rate and overall mesor are below sample means (RHR ≈ 57.8 bpm, mesor z ≈ -1.28), and intradaily variability of heart rate is low (z ≈ -1.73), consistent with low fragmentation of activity/arousal within days. Circadian amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude z ≈ -0.81) while autocorrelation at 24 hours is modestly positive (z ≈ 0.31), indicating a consistent but lower-amplitude rhythm with an afternoon acrophase (~3:34 PM). Hourly deviations show robust nocturnal heart rate dipping and clear afternoon peaks, a typical diurnal pattern. Overall, the wearable physiology favors a profile of subdued cardiac arousal and reasonable day-to-day rhythm regularity, which is often associated with lower perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation with respect to perceived stress (PSS): several protective signals converge — low depressive symptoms, above-average self-esteem, frequent solitary exercise, substantial social time, low resting heart rate, and low intradaily variability — all of which align with lower perceived stress. Opposing signals are present but moderate: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI elevated) and highly variable sleep duration (very large SD) are risk factors for higher perceived stress and poorer daytime well‑being, and trait anxiety is near average rather than notably low. Correlations between individual features and PSS in the dataset are generally small; the strongest available links (trait anxiety and depressive symptoms) are only modestly positive and those scores are not elevated for this participant. Weighing the pattern holistically, the balance of evidence favors a relatively lower or average level of perceived stress compared with the study population.

58793,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Summary of self-report psychological traits and symptoms:
The participant reports relatively low depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 10; Z = -0.34) but shows a modest elevation on trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46). Self-esteem is somewhat lower than the sample mean (RSES = 33; Z = -0.73). Subjective health satisfaction is high (6/7; Z = 1.3) and global sleep quality is at or slightly better than the cohort average (PSQI = 5; Z = -0.8, classified as “Good Sleep”). These self-report indicators point toward generally adaptive functioning on mood and health indices, with the clearest psychological vulnerability being a moderately elevated anxiety-proneness that is known to correlate positively with perceived stress in this sample (STAI–PSS correlation ≈ 0.31).

Sleep and rest/recovery profile:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a long and regular sleep duration (median 9 h 2 min; Z = 2.3) with low nap frequency and modest night-to-night variability (sleep SD ≈ 94 min; Z ≈ -0.15). Subjective and objective sleep quality indicators align in suggesting adequate sleep opportunity and consolidation. In the present dataset, longer sleep duration and relatively good subjective sleep quality are weakly or neutrally associated with perceived stress (small negative correlations), indicating that the participant’s extended nocturnal sleep likely provides protective recovery resources rather than reflecting sleep disturbance linked to high stress.

Circadian and activity rhythm characterization:
Cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics indicate a well-structured 24-hour heart rate rhythm: elevated amplitude (Z = 1.0) and above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.06), with interdaily stability near the cohort mean (Z ≈ 0.09). High amplitude and strong day-to-day autocorrelation have negative correlations with PSS in this cohort, consistent with more regular and robust circadian organization being linked to lower perceived stress. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z = 0.46), which suggests some within-day fragmentation of activity or physiological state; this metric has a small positive correlation with PSS and may represent a minor behavioral irregularity (e.g., variable scheduling or bursts of activity) that could modestly increase perceived stress risk. Overall, the circadian profile leans toward resilience (regular, high-amplitude rhythms) with a small countervailing signal of within-day fragmentation.

Cardiovascular and diurnal arousal patterns:
Resting heart rate is close to sample average (58.7 bpm; Z = 0.07). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (large negative deviations overnight) and substantial rises in the morning (notably an unusually large positive deviation at 8–9 AM, Value = +30.3; Z = 3.52) and another afternoon peak around 4–5 PM (+22.3; Z = 2.0). The large morning spike likely reflects a consistent, high-intensity morning event (e.g., regular morning exercise, commute, or class-related activity) rather than chronic elevated baseline arousal—this pattern is not strongly associated with higher PSS in the cohort. Resting HR and some daytime deviations have small positive correlations with PSS, but the dominant cardiovascular pattern (clear day–night separation and robust amplitude) aligns with lower perceived stress.

Lifestyle, social behavior, and other health-related indices:
Behavioral indicators point to active social engagement and regular physical activity: frequent exercise both alone and with others (≥ three times/week; Zs ≈ 1.07–1.23) and above-average time socializing (3–4 hours/day; Z = 1.74). Alcohol use is moderate (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z = 0.94) while recreational drug use is absent. Academic performance appears strong (GPAs ~3.7–3.8). Together these behaviors (regular exercise, substantial socializing, high health satisfaction) are generally associated with lower perceived stress or provide protective context, and their correlations with PSS are small or negative in the sample.

Integrated interpretation and implications for perceived stress:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the participant shows multiple converging markers associated with lower perceived stress: robust circadian amplitude and day-to-day rhythm consistency, long and regular sleep, frequent exercise, high social engagement, low depressive symptoms, and high health satisfaction. The principal signals that could elevate perceived stress are a modestly elevated trait anxiety score and a small increase in intradaily variability, but both are moderate in magnitude and their associations with PSS are weaker than the protective markers listed above. On balance, the pattern of physiological regularity and adaptive health and social behaviors outweighs the modest anxiety-proneness signal. Therefore the overall profile is more consistent with a PSS score in the lower half of the study distribution (bottom 50th percentile).

96689,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report measures and behavioral habits. The participant reports low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and high self-esteem (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11), both patterns that, in this sample, are weakly associated with lower perceived stress. Alcohol and recreational drug use are reported as none, and exercise and sports frequencies are minimal; abstinence from substances reduces a potential behavioral source of stress exacerbation, while very low exercise could reduce a behavioral buffer against stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) is elevated relative to the sample and has a modest positive correlation with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.31); this is the strongest self-report signal in the direction of higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality crosses the commonly used threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6), indicating some perceived sleep difficulty despite objective sleep metrics described below. Overall, self-report shows a mix of protective features (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, low substance use) and one notable risk feature (elevated trait anxiety) for greater perceived stress.

Sleep timing, duration, and regularity. Fitbit-derived sleep duration is near or slightly above the sample mean (median 7 h 18 m, Z = 0.14) and night-to-night variability in duration is low (SD 38 min, Z = -1.42), suggesting consistent total sleep time across the semester. The participant’s habitual sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 01:55), but start time variability is low (SD 29 min, Z = -1.19), indicating a stable, late sleep schedule. Objective regularity in sleep duration and timing (low variability) is generally associated here with lower PSS correlations, while the subjective PSQI score indicates some experience of disturbed sleep; this pattern (objective regular sleep quantity but subjective disturbance) can occur when sleep timing is misaligned with typical social schedules or when sleep quality complaints are not captured by duration alone. On balance, stable sleep duration argues against chronically fragmented sleep as a major driver of perceived stress, but the late, subjectively disturbed schedule is a potential contributor to stress perception for this individual.

Circadian and heart-rate derived metrics. Heart rate–based circadian metrics show a relatively robust rhythm: amplitude is elevated (Amplitude Z = 1.36) and MESOR is modestly above average (Z = 0.52), while interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are above average (IS Z = 0.75; autocorr Z = 0.98). In this sample, greater circadian amplitude and higher autocorrelation/interdaily stability are weakly associated with lower PSS scores, suggesting that a regular, high-amplitude cardiac rhythm is a protective correlate. Intradaily variability is also somewhat elevated (IV Z = 0.74), which in this dataset is weakly positively correlated with PSS and can reflect greater fragmentation of activity/rest transitions; that signal provides a countervailing small risk. Resting heart rate is low-to-average (58.8 bpm, Z = 0.08), a pattern typically consistent with lower baseline sympathetic arousal and, in this cohort, not strongly predictive of higher PSS. Altogether, the cardiac and circadian profile favors physiologic regularity and robustness more than dysregulation.

Hourly heart rate deviations and diurnal patterning. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected overnight nadir (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and pronounced positive deviations in the afternoon-evening (peaks around 6–9 PM with large positive Z-scores). Many of the larger positive evening deviations are associated with small negative correlations with PSS in this sample, implying these evening elevations are not a strong marker of higher perceived stress here. The overnight troughs are pronounced and consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest. There is no clear pattern of elevated nocturnal heart rate that would suggest persistent nocturnal hyperarousal. Overall hourly patterns are consistent with clear day–night separation of cardiovascular activity rather than chronic physiological hyperarousal.

Integration and implications for perceived stress. Weighing the multimodal evidence, the data present more and stronger indicators associated with lower or average perceived stress than with elevated stress. Protective indicators include low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, low substance use, regular and adequate objective sleep duration, strong circadian amplitude and high interdaily stability/24-hour autocorrelation, and a relatively low resting heart rate—each of which in this sample tends to relate to lower PSS. Counterbalancing risk indicators are elevated trait anxiety (the strongest single self-report correlate of higher PSS here), subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI >5), a late but consistent sleep schedule, and modest intradaily variability in activity. Considering effect sizes and z-scores, the elevated trait anxiety is notable but appears to be outweighed by multiple physiological and behavioral markers of regularity and low disturbance. Therefore, on balance the participant’s profile is more consistent with a PSS score in the lower half (bottom 50%) of the study population distribution.

33657,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report profile and psychological symptom indicators:
The participant’s self-report measures present a mixed but overall modest level of symptom burden. The CES-D score (16) sits slightly above the study mean (Z = 0.28) and meets a commonly used screening cutoff for elevated depressive symptoms, indicating some recent affective symptoms; the CES-D is positively correlated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28). Trait anxiety (STAI trait = 37) is below the sample mean (Z = -0.43) and is classified here as “not anxious”; while STAI correlates positively with PSS in the cohort, the participant’s lower-than-average trait anxiety is a protective signal against higher perceived stress. Measures of self-regard and well-being—self-esteem (Z = 0.4) and current happiness (Z = 0.55)—are above average and show modest negative correlations with PSS (i.e., higher self-esteem and happiness are associated with lower perceived stress). Trust and health satisfaction are also above average but show minimal correlations with PSS. In sum, affective symptomology is present at a low-to-moderate level (CES-D), but trait-level dispositional factors (lower trait anxiety, higher self-esteem and subjective happiness) weigh in the direction of lower perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns relevant to stress:
Daily activity and lifestyle responses indicate some behaviors that could support and some that could undermine stress regulation. The participant reports modest alcohol use (beer and wine 1–2 times/week), low recreational drug use, and low frequency of team sports; structured exercise is infrequent (exercise alone 1–2×/week). Notable is a very high reported duration of sedentary hobby time (Z = 3.19), which may reflect extended low-activity periods and has only a weak relation to PSS in the sample. Subjective sleep quality crosses the commonly used PSQI threshold (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed sleep), and the participant reports a late median sleep onset (01:42). Wearable-derived sleep duration is near sample average (median ~7h5m) but with elevated mean daily naps (Z = 2.23). The combination of late bedtimes, measurable sleep disturbance on the PSQI, and greater napping could reflect partial sleep deficit or circadian misalignment, both of which can influence perceived stress, though the correlations in this dataset with PSS are modest.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian signals:
Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate a relatively attenuated and less-stable rhythm. Interdaily stability is below average (Z = -0.49), intradaily variability is elevated (Z = 0.74), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (Z = -0.36). These features together point to lower day-to-day regularity and greater within-day fragmentation of cardiovascular activity; intradaily variability shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample, suggesting that greater fragmentation modestly aligns with higher perceived stress. Mesor and amplitude are low (mesor Z = -1.46; amplitude Z = -1.18), and resting heart rate is low (51.2 bpm, Z = -0.83). Low resting HR and lower mesor would typically reflect lower tonic cardiovascular arousal; however, the amplitude and stability patterns (reduced amplitude, reduced stability, increased intra-daily variability) can reflect blunted circadian modulation and schedule irregularity, features that in this cohort are weakly associated with higher perceived stress (amplitude r ≈ -0.17; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16). Hourly aggregated deviations show large daytime elevation around late morning (notably 10–11am) and pronounced nocturnal reductions; several early-morning hourly deviations show small positive correlations with PSS, which can be interpreted cautiously as a slight relationship between nocturnal arousal patterns and stress in this sample.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress (PSS):
Weighing the modalities together produces a mixed but overall leaning-toward-average-or-lower perceived stress profile. Factors that favor a lower PSS relative to the study population include below-average trait anxiety, above-average self-esteem and reported happiness, and a low resting heart rate—each of which, in this dataset, is associated with lower perceived stress or is protective relative to PSS. Factors that could elevate PSS—mildly elevated depressive symptom score at the CES-D cutoff, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI >5), late sleep timing, high intra-daily variability, low interdaily stability, and frequent napping—are present but generally show only small-to-modest correlations with PSS in the cohort and are not extreme in magnitude for most measures. Several wearable circadian metrics (reduced amplitude, increased intradaily variability) suggest irregularity that has a modest association with higher PSS, but physiologic markers of tonic arousal (low resting HR, low mesor) and positive psychosocial indicators (self-esteem, happiness, lower trait anxiety) mitigate the likelihood of markedly elevated perceived stress.

Overall PSS group assignment:
Considering the balance of evidence across self-report, behavioral, and wearable physiological domains—where protective dispositional indicators and low tonic cardiovascular arousal appear to outweigh modest risk signals from depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, and circadian irregularity—I estimate that this participant’s PSS score would most likely fall in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., lower or near-median perceived stress rather than the top half).

36117,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but overall resilient psychosocial profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 38, z = -0.33) is below the study mean, and self-reported current happiness and self-esteem are relatively high (Happy current = 5, z = 1.64; SelfEsteem z = 0.96), both of which have modest negative correlations with perceived stress in the cohort. These features suggest the participant appraises life circumstances with more positive affect and self-regard than many peers, a pattern that typically buffers against higher perceived stress. Academic performance is strong (recent GPAs 3.42–3.75), and the participant reports frequent social exercise and extensive socializing with friends (both with large positive z-scores), which are behavioral supports for coping and stress regulation. At the same time, there are some self-report signals that can relate to greater strain: a CES-D score of 16 (z = 0.28) indicates some elevated depressive symptoms relative to the sample, and a PSQI score of 8 (z = 0.59) indicates disturbed subjective sleep quality. Internet use and time in sedentary hobbies are relatively high (z = 2.19 and z = 3.19 respectively), which may reflect lifestyle patterns that do not consistently protect against stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features point to a generally stable daily structure with pockets of physiological activation. Non-parametric and cosinor-derived rhythm metrics are robustly structured: interdaily stability (0.55, z = 1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47, z = 1.23) are above the cohort mean, and amplitude is relatively high (15.67, z = 1.58). These findings indicate a consistent, high-amplitude heart-rate rhythm across days, which in this sample is modestly associated with lower perceived stress. Nighttime aggregate deviations show the expected heart-rate nadir during early morning hours (largest negative deviations around 4–6am), and daytime elevations in the afternoon and evening consistent with regular daytime activity. However, resting heart rate and average cardiac mesor are higher than typical for the cohort (resting HR = 72 bpm, z = 1.65; mesor = 88.9, z = 2.04). Those elevated baseline cardiac indices have small positive correlations with perceived stress in the sample and can reflect higher tonic physiological arousal even in the context of regular circadian structure.

Sleep behavior from wearables shows adequate total sleep time but late timing and some night-to-night variability. Median sleep duration is roughly 7 h 39 m (z = 0.58), which is slightly above average in the sample and generally protective against perceived stress, while median sleep onset is late (about 1:13 AM) with a moderate standard deviation in start time (100 minutes, z = 0.37). Self-reported sleep quality (PSQI = 8) diverges from the objectively sufficient duration and suggests subjective sleep disturbances that could contribute to stress perception. Napping is negligible.

Weighing multimodal evidence for perceived stress: indicators supporting relatively lower or average perceived stress include low trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, frequent social engagement and socially-mediated exercise, robust and regular circadian rhythms (interdaily stability and amplitude), and objectively sufficient sleep duration. Indicators supporting relatively higher perceived stress are elevated depressive symptoms on the CES-D, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), pronounced sedentary leisure and heavy internet use, and elevated tonic cardiac measures (resting HR and mesor) that suggest increased baseline physiological arousal. Correlations between these individual measures and PSS in the cohort are modest in magnitude, so no single metric dominates the inference.

Holistic conclusion: on balance, the constellation of strong social and affective resources (low trait anxiety, high happiness and self-esteem, active social engagement), regular circadian structure, and adequate objective sleep duration weigh more heavily than the modest elevations in depressive symptoms, subjective sleep disturbance, and elevated resting heart rate. Therefore the overall pattern is more consistent with perceived stress in the lower half of the distribution (bottom 50%), rather than the top half.

92515,19.0,0.19430051813471502,"Psychological trait and symptom profile: Self-report measures indicate a generally favorable psychological profile. Depressive symptoms are minimal (CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97) and trait anxiety is below the study mean (STAI = 36, Z = -0.52), while self‑esteem is modestly above average (RSES Z = 0.4). Current happiness is relatively high (self‑rated = 5, Z = 1.64) and trust in others is above average (Z = 0.83). Academic performance is excellent (consistent 4.0 GPA). These trait- and state-level self-reports point toward low to typical levels of negative affect and relatively good psychological resources (self‑esteem, social trust), which are commonly associated with lower perceived stress in student samples.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: Reported health satisfaction is below average (Z = -0.78) and subjective sleep quality crosses the standard PSQI threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6), but other lifestyle factors are not strongly indicative of maladaptive coping. Alcohol use is moderate (beer 1–2/month, wine/liquor 1–2/week) and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise occurs mainly in modest, social contexts (1–2 times/week with others; sports 1–2 times/week). Time use shows routine social and media engagement but limited solitary sedentary hobbies. Overall, behavioral data suggest functional daily routines and social engagement but a signal of reduced satisfaction with health and slightly disturbed subjective sleep.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure: The participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, Z = -0.26), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate moderate regularity: interdaily stability near the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.09), lower-than-average intradaily variability (Z ≈ -0.11), and a relatively strong 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ 0.73). Cosinor amplitude is somewhat reduced (Z ≈ -0.36) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:43 PM). Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs and a pronounced midday elevation (notably 12–3 pm). Wearable sleep metrics identify a short median nocturnal sleep duration (5 h 55 min, Z = -1.58) and very late median sleep onset (~02:57 AM) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ 0.59). These objective patterns describe a physiologically regular schedule with attenuated amplitude and late, short sleep—features that can coexist with good daytime functioning but may reflect behavioral constraints or chronobiological habits that could influence subjective sleep quality.

Integration and implications for perceived stress (PSS): Multiple convergent indicators support an interpretation of relatively low to average perceived stress. Low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, elevated self‑reported happiness and self‑esteem, strong academic performance, limited substance use, and generally stable circadian regularity favor placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Countervailing signals are present but modest: objectively short and late sleep (median <6 hours; PSQI = 6) and reduced circadian amplitude can be associated with increased perceived stress in some samples, and some wearable features (sleep timing variability) show small positive correlations with PSS. However, these signals are small in magnitude relative to the stronger, consistent self-report indicators of low negative affect and good functioning. On balance, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant’s perceived stress is more consistent with the bottom half (lower or average) of the study population distribution rather than the top half.

49790,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report trait and symptom measures point toward relatively low perceived stress. The participant reports minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 27, Z = -1.41), both well below the study mean and consistent with reduced affective distress. Self-esteem is elevated (Rosenberg, Z = +1.10), and global indicators of social trust and health satisfaction are above average (Trust Z = +1.47; Health Satisfaction Z = +1.22). These self-report profiles—low depression and anxiety, higher self-esteem, and favorable ratings of health and trust—are typically associated with lower perceived stress on the PSS and provide primary evidence for placement in the lower half of the study distribution.

Objective wearable-derived measures present a mixed signal that suggests physiological arousal and circadian irregularity despite relatively benign self-reports. Resting heart rate and the MESOR are both elevated (Resting HR = 75.7 bpm, Z = +2.09; MESOR = 88.8, Z = +2.03), indicating a higher-than-average cardiovascular baseline across the recording period. Circadian amplitude is somewhat blunted (Amplitude Z = -0.97) and summary measures of rhythm regularity are reduced (Interdaily Stability = 0.25, Z = -1.32; Autocorrelation at 24 h Z = -1.54), consistent with day-to-day variability in physiological timing. Intradaily variability is near average-to-slightly-elevated (Z = +0.17). The aggregated hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs (large negative deviations overnight) and pronounced evening peaks (notably ~6–7pm), with an acrophase in the early evening (6:15 PM), suggesting the participant’s cardiovascular arousal is shifted later in the day. Collectively, these wearable patterns indicate a higher tonic cardiovascular set point and reduced circadian regularity—both factors that can reflect physiological stress or lifestyle irregularity even when subjective reports are low.

Sleep behavior adds nuance: objectively the participant averages a longer median sleep duration (8 h 4 min, Z = +1.10) and reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 7, slightly above the common clinical cutoff). Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:18) and highly variable (sleep start SD Z = +1.89), indicating irregular and delayed sleep schedules. Longer total sleep time paired with late, inconsistent bedtimes and subjective sleep disturbance suggests compensatory or misaligned sleep rather than uniformly restorative sleep. These sleep characteristics are modestly correlated with higher perceived stress in the sample (sleep timing variability shows a small positive correlation with PSS), and therefore represent a possible source of elevated stress perception even if other self-reports are low.

Weighing the evidence holistically: self-report trait measures strongly indicate lower perceived stress (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem and health satisfaction). Physiological data introduce concerns—an elevated resting heart rate and high MESOR, reduced circadian stability, and late/variable sleep timing—that can reflect physiological stress or lifestyle factors that increase vulnerability to stress. However, the magnitude of the physiological deviations (notably resting HR and MESOR Z > +2) should be considered alongside the consistent, strongly negative z-scores on anxiety and depression and positive psychosocial indicators. Given that perceived stress (PSS) is a subjective measure and the participant’s self-reports of mood and coping are robustly favorable, the balance of evidence favors placement in the lower half of the population distribution for PSS, while noting physiological signs that warrant follow-up or lifestyle interventions to improve circadian regularity and baseline cardiovascular arousal.

78657,17.0,0.06476683937823834,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed but overall not strongly elevated symptom profile. The participant’s CES-D score (12; Z = -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38; Z = -0.33) are slightly below the study mean, and the Rosenberg self‑esteem score is high (39; Z = 0.11), which together suggest limited mood and anxiety burden relative to peers. Subjective sleep quality is worse than typical (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep; Z = 0.13), and self-reported current happiness is somewhat lower than average (3.0; Z = -0.53). Health satisfaction is notably low (2.22; Z = -1.53). Lifestyle reports show frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; Z > 1.0) and robust social time (socializing 2–3 hours; Z = 0.95), alongside moderate alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0). Overall, psychological self-report markers lean toward resilience (lower depressive/anxiety symptom scores, high self‑esteem, frequent social and exercise behaviors) but include specific complaints about sleep and health satisfaction.

Objective wearable data point to circadian irregularity and late, variable sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration from the Fitbit is 6 h 30 min (Z = -0.85) with a median sleep start time around 03:38 AM and substantial night‑to‑night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 123 minutes; Z = 0.88). Actigraphic/cardiac circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.31; Z = -0.82) and elevated intradaily variability (0.67; Z = 0.88), indicating a fragmented, less regular daily rhythm. Resting heart rate and mesor are below the sample mean (RHR = 53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56; mesor = 68.81, Z = -0.70), and heart‑rate amplitude is near average. Aggregated hourly deviations reveal pronounced evening increases in heart rate (notably 7–8 PM: +20.28 bpm, Z = 1.53) and reduced heart rate across early morning hours, consistent with late activity followed by large nocturnal declines. Together these wearable features characterize a late‑timed, variable sleep schedule with physiologic signs of evening activation and poor day‑to‑day rhythm regularity.

Evidence that would support elevated perceived stress (higher PSS) includes the objectively disturbed and variable sleep schedule (PSQI > 5; short median sleep and large sleep start variability), reduced interdaily stability and greater intradaily fragmentation—features previously associated with higher perceived stress—and lower self‑reported happiness and health satisfaction. Several of these metrics have modest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16, sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18), suggesting they may contribute to perceived stress for this participant.

Countervailing evidence consistent with lower or average perceived stress includes below‑average depressive and trait anxiety scores (CES‑D, STAI both slightly below mean), high self‑esteem, frequent social engagement and regular exercise (both protective or stress‑buffering behaviors), and relatively low resting heart rate (likely reflecting fitness rather than hyperarousal). Many correlations between the participant’s elevated wearable evening heart‑rate deviations and PSS are weakly negative or near zero in the sample, indicating those physiological evening peaks are not strongly associated with higher PSS in this cohort. On balance, the psychological symptom profile and protective lifestyle factors argue against markedly elevated perceived stress, while sleep and rhythm irregularities represent the primary domain of vulnerability.

Holistic assessment: weighing the moderate/low self‑reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem, frequent exercise and social contact against the clear sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity, the overall pattern is more consistent with a bottom‑half placement in the study distribution of perceived stress (i.e., not in the top 50% of PSS scores). The participant shows specific sleep‑ and rhythm‑related stressors but lacks broader elevations in mood or anxiety that typically accompany higher PSS in this population.

48154,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports very low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 3, STAI-Trait = 30), both roughly one standard deviation below the study mean (Z ≈ -1.1). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are relatively high (self-esteem Z = +1.66; current happiness Z = +1.64), and self-rated health satisfaction is above average. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5) is at the threshold commonly interpreted as “good” and is below the study average (Z = -0.8). Academic performance (GPA ~3.5) and low frequency of non-prescribed drug use further emphasize functioning that is typical to above-typical for this sample. Taken together, the self-report measures consistently point toward a psychological profile characterized by low symptom burden and stronger positive self-evaluation, which is generally inconsistent with elevated perceived stress.

Objective sleep and rest physiology: Wearable-derived sleep measures show a median nightly sleep duration of about 8 hours and 3 minutes (Z = +1.08) with relatively low night-to-night variability in total sleep time (SD = 64 minutes, Z = -0.85). Napping is essentially absent. Resting heart rate is low-to-average (56 bpm, Z = -0.26). These objective indices indicate sufficient sleep quantity, relatively consistent sleep duration, and a relatively low resting cardiovascular state — patterns that typically accompany lower perceived stress and better physiological recovery.

Circadian and heart-rate rhythm features: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics present a mixed but largely non-alarming picture. Mesor and amplitude are somewhat below the sample mean (mesor Z ≈ -0.78; amplitude Z ≈ -0.71), and interdaily stability is notably low (0.26, Z = -1.23) while intradaily variability is close to average (Z ≈ +0.1). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected deep nocturnal troughs and daytime increases with a pronounced early-evening elevation (largest positive deviations around 5–6 PM); correlations between these hourly deviations and PSS are small in magnitude. Low interdaily stability suggests less rigid day-to-day schedule regularity (e.g., later median sleep start time ~01:03 AM), but this single rhythm feature is a modest correlate of perceived stress in this dataset and is counterbalanced by other physiological markers (adequate sleep amount, low resting HR).

Behavioral habits and lifestyle: The participant reports frequent individual exercise (≥3×/week, Z = +1.07), moderate social contact (1–2 hours/day), limited alcohol and drug use, and low engagement in sedentary hobbies like gaming or reading. Internet use is somewhat above average (2–3 hours, Z ≈ +0.85). Regular exercise, limited substance use, and moderate socializing are behavioral patterns that are typically associated with better stress management and lower perceived stress.

Integration and inference about perceived stress level: Across multiple modalities, the strongest and most consistent signals indicate relatively low perceived stress. Low depression and anxiety scores, high self-esteem and happiness, sufficient objective sleep duration, low resting heart rate, and frequent exercise form a coherent pattern that aligns with lower PSS scores. The primary counter-indicator is reduced interdaily stability and a late median sleep onset (around 1:03 AM), which could reflect schedule variability or evening preference; however, its correlation with PSS in this dataset is small and it is not accompanied by elevated symptom scores or physiological signs of chronic arousal. Considering the balance of self-report, behavioral, and physiological evidence — and given the population distribution (study median PSS = 22, mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68) — the preponderance of data supports classification in the lower half of the PSS distribution.

21793,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"Multimodal summary — psychological self-report and symptom indices:
The participant’s self-report profile shows modest elevations on measures that typically covary with perceived stress. Trait anxiety on the STAI is slightly above the study mean (score 43, Z = 0.17) and positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.31), indicating a mild tendency toward anxiety proneness. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are also modestly elevated relative to the sample (score 15, Z = 0.18) but remain below clinical thresholds; CES-D correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.28). Self-esteem and subjective happiness are somewhat lower than average (RSES Z = −0.17; happiness Z = −0.53) and both show weak negative correlations with PSS, consistent with small inverse relationships between mood/self-worth and perceived stress. Health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z = 0.3), and substance use is low-to-moderate, which are features that would not strongly indicate high perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian behavior — subjective and wearable metrics:
Sleep metrics present a coherent signal of disrupted sleep and circadian irregularity. Subjective sleep quality is impaired (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05; classified as disturbed sleep). Wearable-derived median sleep duration is short (6 h 9 min, Z = −1.29) and sleep timing is markedly delayed and variable (median sleep start ~03:36 AM with a start-time SD Z = 1.04). The participant naps relatively often (mean daily naps 0.33, Z = 3.05). These sleep features—short total sleep, late and variable bedtimes, frequent napping—are consistent with sleep disturbance and align with indices that typically track with higher perceived stress. The PSQI and several sleep variability metrics show small positive correlations with PSS in the dataset, supporting their relevance to perceived stress for this participant.

Wearable circadian and cardiac signatures:
Heart rate–based circadian summary metrics indicate low day-to-day regularity and dampened circadian amplitude. Interdaily stability is very low (0.17, Z = −1.98) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (Z = −1.45), both indicating weak consistency of daily heart rate rhythms across the recording period. Amplitude and mesor are below average (amplitude Z = −1.38; mesor Z = −1.13). Intradaily variability is elevated (Z = 0.95), suggesting more fragmented within-day heart rate patterning. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm, Z = −0.47) but shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r = 0.14). Together these findings suggest a temporally disorganized circadian profile (irregular timing and reduced rhythmic strength), which, in prior work and in the present correlations, associates with higher perceived stress.

Integration and behavioral context:
Behavioral routines and leisure patterns reinforce the above signals. The participant reports relatively high passive media exposure and music listening (listening to music Z = 1.6), limited engagement in reading or sedentary hobbies, and modest exercise frequency. Socializing time is near average. The combination of late/variable sleep, frequent napping, elevated intradaily variability, and mild elevations in trait anxiety and depressive symptoms form a consistent pattern: physiological and behavioral irregularity plus subjective sleep disturbance co-occur with psychological features that typically elevate perceived stress. Protective signals include relatively low substance use, some exercise, and moderate health satisfaction, but these do not fully counterbalance the strength of the sleep/circadian and anxiety indicators.

Evidence weighing for PSS group assignment:
Evidence favoring a higher PSS (top 50%): (1) Mildly elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI Z = 0.17; CES-D Z = 0.18) with moderate positive correlations to PSS; (2) objectively and subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI Z = 1.05; short median sleep duration Z = −1.29; late and variable sleep timing, naps Z = 3.05); (3) markedly reduced interdaily stability and lower circadian amplitude (Zs ≈ −1.4 to −2.0) and increased intradaily variability, which are associated with higher stress in the sample. Evidence favoring lower or average PSS (bottom 50%): (1) relatively low substance use and some engagement in exercise; (2) resting heart rate is low (which is not a direct indicator of low stress here and shows a small positive PSS correlation), and (3) depressive symptom score remains in the non-depressed range. Overall, the preponderance of indicators (sleep disturbance, circadian irregularity, and elevated anxiety trait) point toward higher perceived stress relative to the study population.

Conclusion — PSS group:
Weighing self-report symptom elevations, consistent subjective/objective sleep disturbance, and heart rate circadian disruption—each of which is either correlated with PSS in the dataset or is a known correlate of perceived stress—the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution for perceived stress.

37218,14.0,0.031088082901554404,"Summary of self-report psychological profile:
The participant reports elevated internalizing symptomatology that is relevant to perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 24, Z = +1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = +0.76) are both above the study mean, and both measures have positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), indicating these self-reports are likely to coincide with higher perceived stress. Self-esteem is low (RSES = 29, Z = -1.29), which in the sample relates to PSS in the expected direction (lower self-esteem tends to accompany higher stress). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = +1.52), a feature that commonly amplifies or accompanies perceived stress. Overall, the self-report profile—elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, low self-esteem, and disturbed subjective sleep—constitutes a cluster of psychosocial features that, by themselves, point toward greater perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle context:
Behavioral habits provide mixed signals but do not clearly offset the symptom profile. The participant reports very limited exercise and no use of alcohol or recreational drugs; exercise is virtually absent, which removes a common stress-buffering behavior. Socializing and passive media use (listening to music >4 hours; socializing 3–4 hours) are relatively high compared with peers, but correlations between these activities and PSS are small in this sample, so their net protective effect is uncertain. Overall, lifestyle indicators do not strongly signal low stress and include several factors (low physical activity, poor sleep habits) that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress.

Sleep timing and quantity (wearable + self-report):
Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate short and late-pattern sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is about 6 hours (6 h 1 min; Z = -1.45), substantially below the study average, and sleep start time is very late (median ~03:56 AM), with moderate night-to-night variability. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) is high as noted above. Short sleep duration and delayed sleep timing are both linked empirically to greater stress and poorer mood; in this participant the combination of objectively reduced sleep time and subjectively disturbed sleep supports the inference of increased perceived stress rather than low stress.

Wearable physiological and circadian signals:
Cardiovascular circadian features are broadly consistent with a somewhat blunted rhythm and mildly elevated resting cardiovascular tone. Resting heart rate is modestly above the sample mean (61 bpm, Z = +0.34). Circadian amplitude derived from heart rate is reduced (Amplitude Z = -0.63), while MESOR is slightly elevated (Z = +0.30); reduced amplitude and a modestly higher basal level are patterns that have been associated with chronic stress and affective symptomatology in population studies. Non-parametric rhythm metrics show average intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.03) and somewhat higher interdaily stability (Z ≈ 0.58), consistent with a stable but shifted daily schedule (likely a consistently late sleep–wake timing). Hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations; several early-morning troughs and some late-night elevated values have small positive correlations with PSS in the dataset, but these hourly correlations are minor compared with the uniform signal from self-report and sleep quantity.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Taken together, multiple independent modalities converge on a profile compatible with above-average perceived stress. Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep quality, objectively short and late sleep, reduced circadian amplitude, and a modestly elevated resting heart rate collectively point toward higher PSS rather than lower. Although some social behaviors are frequent, they do not show strong negative associations with PSS in this sample and are unlikely to fully counterbalance the other risk indicators. Therefore, on balance the preponderance of self-report and wearable-derived evidence indicates the participant’s perceived stress is more consistent with the upper half of the study distribution.

17932,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Summary of self-report psychological and behavioral measures:
The participant reports low-to-average symptom burden on standard mood and anxiety scales: a CES-D score of 12 (Z = -0.14; classified “Not depressed”) and an STAI–Trait score of 35 (Z = -0.62; “not anxious”). Both CES-D and STAI show modest positive correlations with PSS in the study sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and the participant’s below-average scores on these instruments therefore point toward relatively lower perceived stress compared with peers. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.82), which is negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.15) and further supports lower perceived stress. Academic performance and health satisfaction are above average (GPA ≈ 3.8 across semesters; health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.97), and the participant reports regular exercise (≥3×/week, Z ≈ 1.07) and limited recreational drug use; these lifestyle features are typically protective and consistent with lower perceived stress. Notable behavioral outliers include elevated video-game time (Z ≈ 2.47) and regular weekly alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0), but correlations between these activities and PSS in the sample are small.

Objective sleep and subjective sleep quality:
Wearable-derived sleep duration is relatively long and regular (median 8 h 35 min; Z ≈ 1.74) with low nap frequency and modest night-to-night variability, suggesting adequate opportunity for sleep. However, subjective sleep quality is markedly poor (PSQI = 13, Z ≈ 2.9, categorized as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating substantial perceived sleep problems despite objectively long sleep time. The participant also has a late median sleep onset (01:23 AM), which may influence daytime functioning. Because the PSQI is highly elevated relative to peers, it represents a salient risk factor for elevated perceived stress in this individual; however, the objective sleep regularity and duration act as mitigating factors.

Physiological and circadian profile from wearables:
Cardiovascular and circadian metrics point to a well-structured, relatively low-arousal physiological profile. Resting heart rate is low (48.7 bpm; Z ≈ -1.13) and mesor is lower than the study mean (Z ≈ -1.01), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic physiological arousal. Circadian regularity is strong: interdaily stability (Z ≈ 1.08) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z ≈ 1.65) are above average, while intradaily variability is low (Z ≈ -1.24), indicating consistent day-to-day timing and low fragmentation of activity/heart-rate rhythms. Hourly deviations from mesor follow a typical diurnal pattern with low heart rate overnight and afternoon/evening elevations; their sample-level correlations with PSS are generally small. Overall, these wearable-derived features are associated with lower stress vulnerability in the study sample.

Integration and implications for perceived stress (PSS):
Weighing the multimodal evidence, several relatively strong indicators favor placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Objective physiological markers (low resting HR, low mesor), strong circadian regularity (high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, low intradaily variability), regular exercise, good academic performance, and below-average depressive and trait-anxiety scores are all consistent with lower perceived stress. The principal opposing signal is markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z ≈ 2.9); because poor sleep is often associated with higher perceived stress, this single, large deviation raises the possibility of elevated PSS despite other protective factors. However, the available depression and anxiety measures (which correlate moderately with PSS in this sample) are below average, and multiple robust objective features point toward lower stress. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (psychological symptom scores, physiological markers, circadian regularity, and lifestyle factors) indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study population with respect to perceived stress.

81420,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures indicate a profile of elevated internalizing symptoms that are consistent with higher perceived stress. Depressive symptomatology on the CES-D is elevated (score = 25, Z = +1.22; classification: “Depressed”), and trait anxiety is also above average (STAI = 50, Z = +0.86). Self-esteem is lower than the study mean (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01). Health satisfaction is relatively low (2.78, Z = -1.11) and the PSQI identifies disturbed sleep (score = 8, Z = +0.59). The CES-D and STAI both show moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.28–0.31), and self-esteem is negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.15); taken together these self-report signals point toward a higher-than-average burden of affective symptoms and cognitive-emotional risk factors that commonly accompany greater perceived stress.

Objective sleep and sleep timing from the wearable show an unusual combination of adequate aggregated duration with late and variable sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is near the study average (7 h 12 m, Z ≈ 0.02) and day-to-day variability in duration is not markedly elevated (SD ≈ 87 minutes, Z ≈ -0.31). However, the median sleep start time is very late (about 02:40 AM) with moderately large variability in start time (SD ≈ 93 minutes). Subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed despite normal total duration, suggesting misalignment between perceived and objective sleep quality. Late and variable sleep timing plus poorer subjective sleep often co-occur with evening activity schedules and can contribute to stress-relevant outcomes even when summed sleep duration is within typical ranges.

Circadian and heart-rate–derived metrics indicate a relatively attenuated and less regular circadian profile. Nonparametric rhythm measures show reduced interdaily stability (0.29, Z ≈ -0.99) and low intradaily variability (0.31, Z ≈ -1.66), while cosinor-derived amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude = 8.49, Z ≈ -0.74). Mesor and resting heart rate are slightly above the study mean (mesor = 78.34, Z ≈ +0.60; resting HR = 62.6, Z ≈ +0.53). Lower amplitude and reduced day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythm have negative and positive associations with PSS respectively in this sample (amplitude r ≈ -0.16; intradaily variability r ≈ +0.16), which is consistent with the interpretation of a blunted circadian amplitude and irregular routine being modestly linked to greater perceived stress in this participant.

Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations relative to the mesor, with the largest negative deviations occurring between ~2–7 AM (largest around 5–7 AM) and daytime peaks across the mid-afternoon to early evening. These hourly deviations are consistent with a nocturnal reduction in cardiovascular activity and a typical daytime rise; the magnitude of daytime elevations (notably mid-afternoon) combined with a slightly elevated resting HR may reflect elevated physiological arousal during waking hours. Correlations between several daytime heart-rate deviations and PSS are small and variable, but the general pattern—reduced nocturnal activity, modestly higher mesor and resting HR, and attenuated amplitude—aligns with the other indicators of increased stress-related physiological tone.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators provide some protective influences but do not fully offset risk signals. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z ≈ +1.07) and moderate social time (1–2 hours; Z ≈ +0.16). Alcohol use is present at a modest level (beer 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ +1.01) and recreational drug use is absent. Self-reported current happiness is slightly above average (score = 4.0, Z ≈ +0.55), and academic performance is in the moderate range. These behavioral supports (regular exercise, social contact, limited substance use) are factors that tend to mitigate perceived stress, but they coexist with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, subjective sleep disturbance, and markers of circadian dysregulation.

Synthesis and inference about perceived stress: multiple convergent indicators point toward relatively elevated perceived stress. The strongest signals are elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ +1.22) and trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.86), both of which correlate positively with PSS in this sample. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) and reduced health satisfaction, combined with a late and variable sleep schedule and attenuated circadian amplitude, further support greater stress burden. Protective behaviors (frequent exercise, social contact, limited drug use) are present but appear insufficient to fully counterbalance the affective and sleep-related risk signals. Considering the weight of evidence from both self-report and wearable-derived physiological patterns, the participant is more consistent with the higher half of perceived stress in this population.

67709,26.0,0.927461139896373,"Participant self-report data indicate elevated internalizing symptomatology that is relevant to perceived stress. The CES-D score is 29 (Z = 1.63), classified in the depressed range, and the STAI–Trait score is 46 (Z = 0.46); both measures have positive correlations with PSS in the study sample (r ≈ 0.28 and 0.31 respectively), suggesting these elevations are likely to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Self‑esteem is below average (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73) and has a modest negative correlation with PSS (r = -0.15), consistent with the pattern that lower self‑esteem aligns with greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) exceeds the common clinical cutoff for disturbed sleep, which also tends to accompany higher stress in the sample.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features provide a mixed picture but include indicators that align with elevated perceived stress. Circadian regularity metrics are relatively low: interdaily stability is modest (0.38, Z = -0.24) and 24‑hour autocorrelation is low (0.19, Z = -1.12), and these metrics correlate negatively with PSS (so lower regularity is associated with higher stress). Intradaily variability is below average (Z = -0.6) while amplitude is slightly above average (Z = 0.27); resting heart rate is relatively low (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56). The low autocorrelation and reduced interdaily stability imply a less consistent day‑to‑day physiological rhythm, which — given its negative correlations with stress — supports an interpretation of relatively higher perceived stress despite a low resting heart rate and preserved amplitude.

Sleep behavior shows important contrasting features. Median nightly sleep duration is comparatively long (8 h 16 min, Z = 1.34), which typically relates to lower stress (correlation small and negative), but sleep timing is extremely delayed (median sleep start ≈ 03:45) with high night‑to‑night variability in duration (SD = 173 minutes, Z = 1.65) and moderately variable sleep onset (SD = 98 minutes, Z = 0.33). High variability of sleep timing and duration has a small positive correlation with PSS in this sample and, together with the disturbed PSQI score, suggests that the participant’s long sleep quantity may coexist with fragmented or irregular sleep patterns that are more commonly observed with elevated perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle features moderate the picture: the participant reports low substance use, frequent social exercise (exercising with others three+ times per week, Z = 1.23), modest happiness and health satisfaction (both slightly above average), and substantial evening/activity-related heart rate elevations (large HR deviation in late afternoon/early evening). Internet use is higher than average (3–4 hours, Z = 1.52) and has a small positive correlation with PSS. These features point to some protective routines (regular social exercise, low substance use, good health satisfaction) but also to behavioral patterns (late and irregular sleep timing, higher internet use) that are associated with higher perceived stress.

Holistic integration: the strongest and most directly relevant signals for perceived stress are the elevated depressive symptom score (CES‑D Z = 1.63), the elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.46), the disturbed PSQI (>5), and objective markers of circadian irregularity (low 24‑hour autocorrelation and reduced interdaily stability). Although long median sleep duration, low resting heart rate, frequent social exercise, and reasonable happiness/health satisfaction are mitigating factors, the combination of elevated mood/anxiety symptoms and irregular sleep/circadian organization — and their documented positive associations with PSS in this sample — provide greater weight toward a higher perceived stress level. Therefore, considering the relative magnitudes and directions of these multimodal signals, it is more likely that this participant’s PSS score falls in the top half of the study distribution.

36552,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Self-report psychological profile and behavior: The participant reports a mix of risk and protective self-reported traits. Trait anxiety (STAI trait = 44, Z = 0.27) is modestly elevated relative to the sample and has a positive correlation with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ 0.31), indicating that higher anxiety-proneness is likely to co-occur with greater perceived stress. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34; classified as not depressed) and would not, on their own, push perceived stress estimates upward. Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40, Z = 0.26) and is negatively associated with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), which provides some buffer against perceived stress. Subjective happiness is somewhat lower than average (current happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53). Lifestyle behaviors include frequent solitary exercise (three times a week or more; Z = 1.07), low substance use, limited social exercise and socializing, and generally short leisure reading time. Taken together, the self-report pattern suggests some psychological resources (high self-esteem, low depressive symptoms, regular exercise) alongside indicators associated with elevated stress (higher trait anxiety, reduced happiness, disturbed subjective sleep).

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signatures: Heart rate–based circadian metrics indicate relatively weakened and irregular rhythms. Interdaily stability is low (0.29, Z = -0.99), intradaily variability is elevated (0.72, Z = 1.23), and amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (7.46, Z = -1.07). These three findings together imply less day-to-day regularity and greater within-day fragmentation of autonomic/behavioral patterns, with a blunted day–night contrast in heart rate. Resting heart rate is moderately higher than the sample mean (64.3 bpm, Z = 0.73) and shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14). Several circadian features that tend to relate to perceived stress in this dataset (higher intradaily variability and resting HR, lower amplitude and stability) are present here; their correlations with PSS are small-to-moderate but consistently point toward an association between physiological irregularity and higher perceived stress.

Hourly heart rate deviations and activity patterning: Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show the largest positive deviation in the mid-to-late afternoon (3–4 pm: +19.92 bpm, Z = 1.99), consistent with a pronounced afternoon peak in cardiovascular activation. Night and early-morning hours show large negative deviations relative to the mesor (e.g., 3–6 am around -11 to -14 bpm), consistent with nocturnal reduction in heart rate but the combination of a blunted amplitude and high intradaily variability suggests that the overall day–night contrast is reduced relative to the study sample. Correlations between specific hourly deviations and PSS are small and mixed, but the overall heart rate profile (elevated resting HR, reduced amplitude, fragmented rhythms) aligns with physiological patterns that, in this dataset, are modestly associated with greater perceived stress.

Sleep timing and duration: Fitbit-derived sleep shows relatively short median nightly sleep (6 h 23 m, Z = -1.0) and a late median sleep onset time (01:28:30). Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is relatively low (SD ~49 minutes, Zs around -0.75 to -1.17), indicating consistent but late and somewhat short sleep. Subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI = 7, Z = 0.13). Short, late sleep and subjective disturbance are commonly linked to higher stress; in this dataset, sleep variability shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.15), but median sleep duration correlates only weakly with PSS (r ≈ -0.04). The combination of late timing, short duration, and subjective disturbance nonetheless supports a profile consistent with increased day-to-day strain or arousal.

Holistic synthesis and PSS distribution placement: No direct PSS score for this participant is provided, so the placement must rely on converging evidence across domains. Indicators supporting higher perceived stress include modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), shortened and late sleep timing, physiologic signs of circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, low amplitude), and an elevated resting heart rate. Several of these wearable metrics have small but directionally consistent positive correlations with PSS in the cohort (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16; resting HR r ≈ 0.14), and trait anxiety correlates with PSS more strongly (r ≈ 0.31). Contrasting evidence favoring lower perceived stress includes low depressive symptom burden and high self-esteem, and healthy behaviors such as regular solitary exercise and low substance use. Balancing these signals, the physiological and sleep-based markers that tend to reflect chronic arousal and circadian disruption, together with elevated trait anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep, provide stronger and more consistent evidence that this participant would fall in the higher half of the sample on perceived stress. Therefore, on balance the multimodal profile suggests a PSS placement in the top 50% of the study population.

63138,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report measures indicate a relatively favorable psychological profile in this participant. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55) and trait anxiety is close to the study mean (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13), with both scales showing only modest positive correlations with PSS in the population (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Self-esteem is high (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03) and current happiness and health satisfaction are above average (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.38); both of these self-report indices have weak negative correlations with perceived stress in the sample. Together, these self-reports point toward an overall low-to-average burden of negative affect and reasonable psychosocial resources that typically relate to lower perceived stress.

Objective sleep and circadian-derived metrics from the wearable are broadly consistent with good sleep quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep duration is long relative to peers (8 h 21 m, Z = 1.45) with low night-to-night variability in duration (SD Z = -0.8) and few naps (Z = -0.86). These sleep patterns—longer, more stable nocturnal sleep—are generally associated with lower perceived stress and better recovery. The participant’s sleep start time is late (median ≈ 01:37) but with modest variability (SD Z = -0.54); a late chronotype can coexist with good sleep quantity but may carry different social or scheduling stressors depending on context.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm indices present a mixed but not strongly concerning profile. Resting heart rate is modestly above the cohort mean (62.9 bpm, Z = 0.56) and mesor and amplitude values indicate a pronounced day–night difference in heart rate (mesor Z = 0.44; amplitude Z = 0.88); acrophase near early evening (≈5:09 PM) aligns with typical daytime peaks. The hourly aggregated deviations show expected nocturnal dips and daytime elevations; several daytime hours show relatively large positive deviations (e.g., early evening with Z ≈ 1.1). Notably, intradaily variability (IV) of the heart-rate rhythm is elevated (IV = 0.71, Z = 1.16), which in the study correlates modestly with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.16). Elevated IV can indicate greater fragmentation of activity/physiology within days and may reflect behavioral irregularities (e.g., variable activity or stress-linked arousals), but by itself it is a small effect relative to the participant’s other favorable indicators.

Lifestyle behaviors provide additional context but do not strongly point toward elevated perceived stress. Alcohol consumption is moderately above average for the sample (beer/wine 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), while recreational drug use is absent. Exercise frequency is low (infrequent solitary exercise, Z = -1.18), which could relate to lower physical-activity–related stress buffering, but exercise metrics in this dataset show weak correlations with PSS. Low engagement in sedentary hobbies and limited screen/leisure time are observed (negative Zs), and academic performance is high (GPAs ≈ 3.8–3.94), which may reflect functional capacity and coping with academic demands.

Integrated interpretation and PSS placement: weighing the evidence, the preponderance of indicators favors a lower or average perceived stress level. Key contributors are low depressive symptom scores, near-average trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, above-average and stable sleep duration, and high academic performance—each of which is either directly associated with lower stress or neutral. Countervailing signals are modest: elevated intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythms (Z ≈ 1.16) and a slightly elevated resting heart rate (Z ≈ 0.56) that modestly correlate with higher PSS in the cohort, plus a late sleep onset time that could be a situational stressor. On balance, the magnitude and consistency of the low/neutral psychological symptom scores and robust sleep favor classification in the lower half of the PSS distribution.

16654,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports minimal depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 0.0, Z = -1.38; STAI–Trait = 34, Z = -0.72), along with high self-esteem (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11) and above-average satisfaction with physical health (6/7, Z = 1.3). These trait-level self-reports are factors that, in this sample, are associated with lower perceived stress (CES-D and STAI scores correlate positively with PSS; self-esteem correlates negatively). The participant’s current affect shows a modestly lower happiness rating (3.0, Z = -0.53), which is a small signal in the direction of greater momentary distress but is not matched by trait symptom measures.

Daily activities and health behaviors: The participant reports substantial social engagement and regular group exercise (socializing 2–3 hours daily, Z = 0.95; exercising with others ≥3×/week, Z = 1.23) and participates in individual sport/exercise at least weekly. Alcohol use is moderate (beer/wine 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) and non-prescribed/recreational drug use is absent. These behavioral patterns (regular social contact and frequent group exercise) align with factors that have weak-to-moderate negative associations with PSS in the cohort, suggesting behavioral supports for lower perceived stress rather than markers of elevated stress.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular profile: Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a robust, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.54, Z = 1.08), amplitude is elevated (15.22, Z = 1.44), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is modestly positive (Z = 0.56). The participant’s resting heart rate is low-moderate (59.7 bpm, Z = 0.18). Hourly aggregated deviations from mesor show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decreases (largest negative deviations −24 to −20 bpm between ~4–7 AM, Zs ≈ −0.9 to −1.0) and a daytime peak in the early afternoon (1–2 PM: +18.8 bpm, Z = 1.83). In this dataset, stronger circadian regularity and larger amplitude are associated with lower PSS scores (negative correlations), so the participant’s strong, regular heart-rate rhythm provides physiological evidence consistent with lower perceived stress.

Sleep duration and timing: Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate adequate total sleep and high night-to-night consistency. Median sleep duration is 7 h 46 m (Z = 0.73), sleep duration SD is relatively low (55 minutes, Z = −1.04), and sleep start times are consistently late (median start ~01:37 AM) with low variability (SD 30 minutes, Z = −1.17). The participant reports some subjective sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score = 6, just above the common threshold), yet wearable data show stable, sufficient sleep quantity and no daytime naps. In the cohort, greater sleep regularity and sufficient duration tend to associate with lower perceived stress; the combination here (consistent but late sleep timing, sufficient duration) points toward sleep-related behaviors that are neutral-to-protective with respect to PSS, with the subjective PSQI score representing a modest counterpoint.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress: Multiple independent indicators converge on lower-than-average perceived stress. Low depressive and anxiety trait scores, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, regular social and exercise behaviors, strong circadian rhythm amplitude and stability, consistent sufficient sleep duration, and a relatively low resting heart rate all align with patterns associated with lower PSS in this sample (several of these features have correlations in the expected directions). Countervailing signals are limited: a slightly reduced self-reported current happiness and a PSQI just above the common cutoff suggest some subjective sleep-related disturbance or momentary dissatisfaction, and the participant’s median sleep onset is late (consistent but late), which could reflect schedule factors rather than elevated stress. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution.

29134,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report data indicate a mixed profile in psychological trait measures: scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, z ≈ -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, z ≈ -0.33) are slightly below the study mean, and self-esteem is modestly above average (RSES = 39, z ≈ 0.11). These results point to relatively low self-reported core mood and trait-anxiety symptoms compared with the cohort. In contrast, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is markedly elevated (PSQI = 11, z ≈ 1.98) consistent with pronounced subjective sleep disturbance. Other lifestyle reports show frequent social exercise and sports participation (exercise with others and sports both 3+ times/week, z ≈ 1.2–1.6), moderate alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week, z ≈ 0.9–1.0), and generally positive health satisfaction (5/7, z ≈ 0.55). Overall, the self-report profile combines relatively low mood/anxiety symptom burden and good social/physical activity engagement with a clear signal of poor subjective sleep quality.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics provide convergent evidence of disrupted sleep timing and circadian organization despite adequate average sleep duration. Median nightly sleep duration is healthy (7 h 40 m, z ≈ 0.6), but sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:13) and highly variable (sleep start SD ≈ 183 minutes, z ≈ 2.2). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is also elevated (SD ≈ 159 minutes, z ≈ 1.33). Circadian features derived from heart-rate cosinor analysis show an average mesor and amplitude below the cohort mean (mesor z ≈ -0.56, amplitude z ≈ -0.51) and overall interdaily stability near average (0.41, z ≈ 0.0) with slightly reduced intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ -0.18). Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, z ≈ -0.33), consistent with physical fitness and frequent exercise. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime peaks but with pronounced reductions during early-morning hours and midday increases; correlations between some early-morning HR deviations and PSS are small-to-moderate positive (e.g., 5–6am correlation ≈ 0.21), indicating that epochs of physiological arousal patterning have modest associations with perceived stress in this dataset.

Integrative interpretation regarding perceived stress (PSS): there are competing signals. Protective factors for lower perceived stress include below-average depression and trait-anxiety scores, elevated self-esteem, frequent social/organized exercise, and a relatively low resting heart rate. Against those, there is a robust and consistent sleep signal associated with higher stress risk: very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI high), late average sleep timing, and notably high variability in sleep onset and duration — features that are commonly linked to elevated perceived stress and poorer stress regulation. Circadian amplitude is reduced, which in this cohort is modestly associated with higher PSS, and several sleep-timing variability metrics show small positive correlations with PSS. Alcohol use is higher than average and could represent a behavioral correlate of stress, though its direct correlations with PSS are small in this dataset. Given the magnitude of disturbed sleep (PSQI z ≈ 1.98) and very high sleep timing variability (sleep start SD z ≈ 2.2), these strong sleep-related indicators carry substantial weight for perceived stress despite relatively low scores on depression and trait anxiety. On balance — weighing the strong sleep disturbance and irregularity against protective low-mood/anxiety scores and high activity — the overall multimodal profile is more consistent with a level of perceived stress at or above the cohort median.

24029,30.0,0.9844559585492227,"Self-report measures indicate a profile of elevated internalizing symptoms alongside several behavioral strengths. The participant’s CES-D (21; Z = 0.8) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z = 0.86) scores are above the sample mean and are positively associated with perceived stress in this study (CES-D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29; Z = -1.29), which in the sample is modestly associated with higher PSS scores. Sleep quality reported on the PSQI (score = 6; classified as disturbed; Z = -0.33) is consistent with some subjective sleep difficulties. At the same time, the participant reports multiple protective behaviors: frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; Zs > 1.0), minimal substance use, good academic performance (GPA ~3.6–3.7), and moderate self-reported happiness and health satisfaction. These behavioral strengths would tend to moderate perceived stress but do not negate the elevated mood/anxiety symptom indicators.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart rate metrics point to a structured but mildly irregular physiological profile. Mesor and amplitude of heart rate are near the sample mean (mesor ≈ 72.9 bpm, amplitude ≈ 11.5) while resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm; Z = -0.42), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness or a low basal heart rate. Non-parametric circadian features show somewhat elevated intradaily variability (value = 0.7; Z = 1.09) with modest interdaily stability (0.42; Z = 0.09) and a low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z ≈ -0.53). Together, these suggest relatively frequent within-day shifts in activity or arousal (fragmentation) and less pronounced day-to-day 24-hour regularity in heart rate patterns. Aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart rate troughs and a large morning surge (very negative deviation overnight; large positive deviation 6–7am, Z ≈ 4.77), followed by elevated late-afternoon/early-evening deviations—patterns consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest but marked morning activation and intra-day fluctuation.

Sleep behavior measured by the wearable supports the subjective report of imperfect sleep: median nightly sleep duration was under seven hours (6 h 46 min; Z ≈ -0.52) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 102 minutes). Sleep start time is around 22:45 with appreciable variability (SD ≈ 99 minutes; Z ≈ 0.36). The absence of naps and a low mean daily nap count reduces confounding daytime sleep but the combination of slightly short sleep duration, variable bedtimes, and elevated intradaily physiological variability aligns with behavioral and physiological patterns often accompanying elevated perceived stress.

Integrative assessment weighing self-report and wearable data favors placement of this participant above the study median for perceived stress. The strongest indicators driving this conclusion are the elevated depressive and trait anxiety scores (both positively correlated with PSS in the sample), low self-esteem, and objective markers of intra-day physiological fragmentation (intradaily variability and reduced 24-h autocorrelation), along with subjective sleep disturbance. Protective factors—frequent exercise, low substance use, good GPA, and relatively low resting heart rate—mitigate but do not fully offset the convergent signal from affective symptoms and circadian/ sleep irregularity. Given the balance of evidence (moderately elevated mood/anxiety scores, correlated wearable indices of fragmentation/arousal, and disturbed sleep), the participant’s overall perceived stress is more consistent with the top half of the study distribution.

35361,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Psychological self-report profile:
The participant’s questionnaire responses indicate relatively low symptom burden and favorable self-evaluations. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are low (score = 7, Z = -0.66) and trait anxiety is in the lower-to-average range (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33). Self-esteem is at the upper end of the scale (Rosenberg = 40, Z = 0.26) and current happiness and health satisfaction are above the study mean (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.55). Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26). These self-report indicators are internally consistent and, based on their directions and correlations with PSS provided in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31; self-esteem r ≈ -0.15), provide evidence consistent with comparatively lower perceived stress rather than elevated stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
Behavioral habits support an interpretation of relatively adaptive routines. The participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use (z-scores for substance use range around -0.3 to -1.3), exercises frequently (exercised alone three+ times/week, Z ≈ 1.07), and engages in relatively low passive screen time (internet and TV usage both below the sample mean). Reading time is above average (Z = 1.30), while socializing time is modest (Z ≈ -0.62). These behaviors—regular physical activity, low substance use, moderate social engagement, and limited passive media time—are typically associated with lower perceived stress in college populations (several activity items show small negative correlations with PSS in the dataset).

Sleep and sleep variability:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 hours 56 minutes (Z = -0.31), with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep SD 61 minutes, Z = -0.91) and few naps (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Sleep start time is around 00:57 with moderate variability (start time SD Z = -0.21). Subjective PSQI corroborates generally good sleep. Taken together, the participant shows slightly below-average total sleep time but stable sleep timing and good subjective quality—patterns that, in this sample, do not strongly indicate elevated perceived stress (sleep metrics have small correlations with PSS in the dataset).

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Heart-rate-derived circadian metrics indicate a well-structured, stable rhythm and low tonic cardiovascular arousal. Interdaily stability is relatively high (value = 0.59, Z = 1.49) and intradaily variability is low (value = 0.37, Z = -1.24), suggesting consistent daily timing of activity and limited fragmentation of the circadian profile; the dataset shows interdaily stability correlated modestly with lower PSS (r ≈ -0.12). Resting heart rate is low (49.8 bpm, Z = -0.99), and mesor is slightly below sample mean (67.79, Z = -0.84), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline arousal. Circadian amplitude is above the mean (Z = 0.87) and the acrophase is mid-late afternoon (4:28 PM), indicating a pronounced day-night contrast in heart rate. Hourly aggregate deviations show expected negative deviations overnight (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM with Z-scores down to -1.71) and elevated daytime values concentrated around late morning to afternoon; where correlations with PSS are available, higher amplitude and stronger stability tend to relate to lower PSS in the sample (r values ~ -0.17 to -0.12). Taken together, these wearable-derived profiles point toward physiological patterns associated with lower perceived stress rather than elevated stress.

Evidence weighing for lower vs higher perceived stress:
Evidence favoring lower or average perceived stress (bottom half of the PSS distribution) is substantial and multiform: low depressive and anxiety self-report scores (CES-D, STAI), high self-esteem and happiness, good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = -1.26), regular exercise and negligible substance use, and wearable indices indicating stable circadian rhythms (interdaily stability Z = 1.49) and low resting heart rate (Z = -0.99). Many of these features have small-to-moderate negative correlations with PSS in the dataset, aligning them with lower PSS. Countervailing signals for elevated perceived stress are minimal: total sleep time is slightly below average (~7 hours, Z = -0.31) and there is modest variability in sleep-start timing, but these are small effects; a low self-reported trust score (Z = -1.1) is noted but its correlation with PSS is negligible in this sample. A few hourly heart-rate correlations with PSS are positive in the overnight hours, but the participant’s overnight heart-rate deviations are strongly negative (lower heart rate), which aligns with lower rather than higher PSS.

Conclusion and PSS group assignment:
The convergent pattern across self-report, behavioral, and wearable physiological measures is most consistent with a lower-to-average perceived stress profile relative to the study population. On balance, the participant’s data provide stronger support for placement in the bottom half of the PSS distribution (i.e., not among the relatively higher-perceived-stress group).

The participant reports minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 1; z = -1.28) and low trait anxiety (STAI-Trait = 31; z = -1.02), both of which correlate positively with perceived stress in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES z = 1.1) and correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), which further points toward lower perceived stress. Objective academic performance is high (GPA in the ~3.7–3.9 range), a behavioral indicator that often aligns with lower perceived stress in student samples or with effective coping/management of academic demands.

Sleep and circadian metrics show a mixed but not strongly stress-linked pattern. Median nightly sleep duration is within a healthy range (7 h 18 m; z = 0.15) despite a late median sleep start time (≈ 02:19) and moderate night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 78 min). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) crosses a conventional cutoff for disturbed sleep but is only modestly displaced from the sample mean (z = -0.33) and shows only a small negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.05). Circadian rhythm measures from heart rate reveal relatively blunted amplitude (amplitude z = -0.57) and modest interdaily stability/intradaily variability (z ≈ -0.16 to -0.18), suggesting less pronounced day–night rhythmicity than average; these features have small associations with perceived stress in the cohort (|r| ≲ 0.16), so their contribution to PSS is uncertain but not strong.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular patterns suggest orderly physiology with a generally low resting heart rate (56.3 bpm; z = -0.22) and normal daytime elevations. Aggregate hourly deviations from the mesor show an expected early-morning trough and afternoon peak (largest positive deviation around 1–2 pm), consistent with routine daytime activity. One notable feature is a relatively elevated mean heart rate around midnight (12–1 am; value = +9.81; z = 1.66), which could reflect late-evening activity or transient nocturnal arousal, but this hourly deviation has a small negative correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.08), diminishing its weight as an indicator of higher perceived stress. Overall, the heart-rate-derived circadian summary (MESOR slightly below average, amplitude reduced) does not strongly support elevated stress relative to the group.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators provide additional context that aligns with lower perceived stress. The participant reports low levels of exercise (no regular exercise; markedly low z-scores), moderate socializing (2–3 hours; z = 0.95), occasional alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; z = 0.94), and minimal recreational drug use. High social time and low depressive/anxiety symptom burden, together with good sleep quantity and low resting heart rate, are more consistent with being in the lower half of perceived stress in this sample. A few mild risk-relevant features (late sleep timing, slightly disturbed PSQI score, blunted circadian amplitude) could contribute to situational strain but do not, in combination with the stronger low-depression/low-anxiety signals, provide convincing evidence for elevated perceived stress.

Integrative assessment and PSS-group assignment: weighing trait self-report measures (notably very low CES-D and STAI scores, and elevated self-esteem), objective physiological markers (low resting HR, generally normative sleep duration), and behavioral indicators (high GPA, substantial social time), the preponderance of evidence supports a lower or average level of perceived stress relative to the study population. Although there are minor signals that could be stress-relevant (late sleep timing, PSQI just above clinical cutoff, reduced circadian amplitude, occasional late-night HR elevation), these are small in magnitude and have modest correlations with PSS in the cohort. Holistically, the participant is more consistent with the bottom half of the PSS distribution (lower/median perceived stress).

95490,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"Self-report indicators point to a profile consistent with elevated perceived stress. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) is above the study mean and shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31), indicating that dispositional anxiety is a salient contributor to perceived stress. Depressive symptom scores (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07) are near the sample mean and less strongly associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), while self-esteem is below average (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59) and happiness is lower than average (current happiness Z = -0.53). Together, the elevated trait anxiety, modest depressive symptoms, and lower self-reported well-being are consistent with a tendency toward higher perceived stress rather than low or minimal stress.

Sleep-related self-report and actigraphy-informed metrics further support a tendency toward greater perceived stress. The participant’s PSQI score (6) exceeds the typical threshold for clinically noteworthy sleep disturbance and aligns with subjective reports of disturbed sleep. Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration is slightly below average (6 hr 56 min, Z = -0.30) and sleep onset is late (median start ~01:11) with substantial night-to-night variability (start-time SD ≈ 101 min, Z ≈ 0.40). These patterns—shorter-than-average sleep, late and variable sleep timing, and subjective sleep disturbance—are commonly associated with higher perceived stress and poorer mood in student samples.

Circadian and heart-rate–derived physiology indicates a somewhat weakened and irregular circadian signal with periods of elevated daytime arousal. Nonparametric circadian metrics show low interdaily stability (IS = 0.23, Z = -1.48) and modestly elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.60, Z = 0.39), indicating irregular daily structure and greater fragmentation of heart rate patterns across the recording period. Parametric features show a somewhat reduced amplitude (8.34, Z = -0.79) and a mesor modestly above the sample mean (77.1 bpm, Z = 0.43); resting heart rate is slightly elevated (61.4 bpm, Z = 0.39). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal dips and relatively large afternoon/evening peaks (notably 4–6 pm deviations ≈ +16 bpm, Z > 0.8). Several of these wearable features (higher IV, slight elevations in resting/mean heart rate, and specific early-morning/evening deviation patterns) demonstrate small positive correlations with PSS in the dataset, suggesting these physiological patterns are consistent with higher perceived stress in this sample.

Behavioral habits provide mixed signals, with both protective and risk-related elements. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z ≈ 1.07) and substantial social time (socializing 2–3 hours; Z ≈ 0.95), both of which are generally associated with lower stress and better mood. At the same time, alcohol consumption is relatively frequent (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 0.94–1.01), which can be associated with stress-related coping in student populations. Recreational drug use is absent, and napping is rare. Overall, behavioral resources (exercise, socializing) could buffer stress, but their presence does not fully counterbalance signals from anxiety, sleep disturbance, and circadian irregularity.

Holistic assessment and PSS-group assignment: although direct PSS score for this participant is not provided, multiple converging indicators—elevated trait anxiety (Z = 0.56), subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), lower happiness and self-esteem, slight increases in resting/mean heart rate, and markedly reduced interdaily stability of circadian rhythms—are more consistent with a PSS level in the upper half of the study distribution than with the lower half. Protective behaviors (regular exercise, active socializing) are notable and likely mitigate some stress burden, but the balance of psychological and physiological evidence favors relatively elevated perceived stress. Therefore, the participant is more likely to fall in the top 50% of PSS scores in this sample.

90079,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report profile and symptom-level indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile shows predominantly normative scores on mood and trait anxiety but some indications of lower subjective well-being. CES-D (score 14, z ≈ 0.07) and STAI–Trait (score 38, z ≈ −0.33) do not indicate large elevations in depressive or trait-anxiety symptoms relative to the study sample. However, measures of well-being are modestly lower than average: self-esteem (RSES score 34, z ≈ −0.59) and current happiness (z ≈ −0.53) are below the sample mean, and trust in others is substantially low (z ≈ −1.42). Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7, z ≈ 0.13). These self-report elements suggest a mixed picture in which overt mood and anxiety symptoms are not pronounced but the participant reports lower positive affect and interpersonal trust and perceives poorer sleep, all of which can contribute to elevated perceived stress even when trait anxiety is not high.

Paragraph 2 — Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics show short and irregular nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 54 minutes (z ≈ −1.59), substantially shorter than the study average, and night-to-night variability in duration is comparatively high (SD ≈ 138 minutes; z ≈ 0.84). Median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:53), with moderate variability in sleep start (SD ≈ 104 minutes; z ≈ 0.46). The pattern of short, late, and inconsistent nocturnal sleep, together with a PSQI in the disturbed range, is behaviorally consistent with increased sleep-related strain and circadian misalignment; such sleep characteristics are commonly associated with higher perceived stress and poorer daytime functioning.

Paragraph 3 — Circadian organization and heart-rate-derived rhythms:
Cardiovascular circadian metrics indicate reduced 24-hour regularity and increased fragmentation. Interdaily stability is low (0.21, z ≈ −1.65) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (z ≈ −1.54), suggesting weak day-to-day regularity in the participant’s heart-rate rhythm. Intradaily variability is elevated (0.75, z ≈ 1.44), indicating greater within-day fragmentation of the rhythm. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (z ≈ −1.37) while MESOR (mean level) is modestly above average (MESOR z ≈ 0.41) and resting heart rate is higher than average (65.6 bpm, z ≈ 0.89). Collectively these features describe a flattened, irregular cardiac rhythm with higher baseline cardiovascular tone — a physiological profile that is frequently associated with greater allostatic load and is directionally consistent with higher perceived stress.

Paragraph 4 — Hourly heart-rate deviations and time-of-day physiology:
Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal troughs and relatively elevated evening and early-night values. The largest negative deviations occur in the early morning (e.g., −12.7 bpm at 3–4am), while positive deviations appear across mid-afternoon and peak in the evening (notably 6–8pm values ≈ +9–10 bpm). Several early-morning deviations (around 3–7am) and the elevated resting HR have small positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (correlations up to ≈ 0.21 for certain morning windows), suggesting that greater nocturnal suppression/overnight dysregulation and higher basal heart rate are modestly associated with higher perceived stress in the sample. Given that these hourly values are aggregated, they indicate typical diurnal arousal structure consistent with reduced nocturnal recovery and higher daytime/evening arousal.

Paragraph 5 — Integration and implications for perceived stress (PSS):
When integrating self-report, sleep, and wearable physiology, the most salient signals relevant to perceived stress are objective sleep deficiency and irregularity (short median sleep, late and variable sleep timing), reduced circadian regularity and increased intraday fragmentation (interdaily stability z ≈ −1.65; intradaily variability z ≈ 1.44), and a modestly elevated resting heart rate (z ≈ 0.89). These multimodal markers are directionally linked to stress-related burden even though traditional symptom scales for depression and trait anxiety are not markedly elevated. Correlational links between several of these wearable-derived metrics and PSS in the sample (small-to-moderate positive correlations for intradaily variability, resting HR, and sleep-timing variability) further support an interpretation of relatively elevated perceived stress driven by physiologic and behavioral dysregulation rather than by high scores on trait anxiety or depressive symptom inventories.

Conclusion — PSS group classification:
Taking the multimodal evidence together — notably significant short and inconsistent sleep, low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythms, and modestly elevated resting heart rate — the balance of indicators favors placement in the higher half of PSS scores in this study population. Although self-reported depression and trait anxiety are not strongly elevated, the objective signs of circadian disruption and sleep restriction are consistent with higher perceived stress. Therefore the participant is classified as likely in the top 50% of the study distribution for perceived stress.

22842,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Psychological self-report profile: The participant reports elevated affective symptoms relative to the study sample. Depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 20, Z = 0.70) and trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) are both above the population mean and show positive correlations with perceived stress in the dataset (CES-D r = 0.28; STAI r = 0.31), indicating these symptom domains are likely to co-occur with higher PSS scores. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52; classified as disturbed sleep), and self-esteem is modestly below average (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31; correlation with PSS r = -0.15). Substance use is minimal and physical health satisfaction is relatively high (health satisfaction Z = 0.88), suggesting several protective lifestyle features that may buffer perceived stress despite elevated affective symptoms.

Behavioral and daily-routine indicators: Actively exercised alone several times per week (exercise-alone Z = 1.07), which is a protective health behavior. However, the participant has a late and irregular sleep schedule: the median wearable-derived sleep start time is very late (02:56 AM) with high night-to-night variability in sleep onset (sleep start SD = 164 minutes, Z = 1.79). Median nightly sleep duration is adequate on average (7 hours 51 minutes, Z = 0.83) but variability in sleep timing and frequent napping are notable (mean daily naps = 0.28, Z = 2.40). Recreational habits show elevated time in video gaming (Z = 1.71) and low engagement in reading and music listening. Overall behavioral patterns point to social and circadian irregularity (late, variable sleep timing and increased napping) even while total sleep time and exercise frequency appear relatively preserved.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics: Heart-rate based circadian structure is blunted and less stable relative to peers. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.30, Z = -0.90) and amplitude of the cosinor rhythm is reduced (amplitude = 8.7, Z = -0.67), both of which are consistent with weaker day-to-day regularity and dampened circadian modulation; amplitude shows a negative correlation with PSS in the sample (r = -0.17), so lower amplitude aligns with higher perceived stress. The participant’s mesor and resting heart rate are on the lower side of the sample distribution (mesor 69.34, Z = -0.63; resting HR 54.2, Z = -0.47). Aggregated hourly deviations show expected nightly HR reductions during sleep hours and daytime increases in the afternoon and evening (peak deviation around early evening; acrophase ~6:03 PM), but the large night-to-night variability in sleep timing likely contributes to the low interdaily stability and increased napping signal. Several wearable-derived rhythm features (e.g., interdaily stability, intradaily variability, sleep timing variability) have modest correlations with PSS in the dataset, and the participant’s pattern—reduced stability, blunted amplitude, and high sleep-onset variability—is overall more consistent with profiles that accompany elevated perceived stress.

Integration and likely PSS placement: Synthesizing the multimodal evidence, there are multiple convergent indicators that are associated with higher perceived stress in this participant: elevated depressive and trait anxiety scores (both positively correlated with PSS), poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI high), pronounced variability in sleep timing and increased napping (sleep start SD Z = 1.79; naps Z = 2.40), and blunted circadian amplitude with reduced interdaily stability. Offsetting factors include relatively adequate median sleep duration, frequent exercise, low substance use, and a relatively low resting heart rate, but these do not fully counterbalance the constellation of affective symptoms and circadian/sleep irregularity that tend to co-occur with greater perceived stress. Given the pattern and the strength of associations in the available metrics, the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s perceived stress score would fall in the higher half of the study distribution.

14279,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Summary of self-report psychological measures and behaviors:
The participant’s self-report profile indicates relatively low symptom burden on standard mood and anxiety screens. Depressive symptom score (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) is well below the sample mean, and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) is slightly below average; both of these individual scales have modest positive correlations with PSS in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so the low scores on those measures are consistent with lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is at the top of the scale (RSES = 40, Z ≈ 0.26), which correlates inversely with PSS (r ≈ -0.15), again pointing toward lower perceived stress. The PSQI indicates some subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep), but that value is only slightly above the population mean (Z ≈ 0.13). Health satisfaction and self-reported happiness are slightly below average (health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.37; happiness Z ≈ -0.53), and trust in others is unusually low (Z ≈ -1.74); these isolated, lower-scoring items could reflect situational concerns but are not of the same magnitude as the low depression/anxiety and high self-esteem signals.

Sleep behavior and circadian organization:
Wearable-recorded sleep shows objectively long and relatively regular sleep: median sleep duration is approximately 8 h 11 m (Z ≈ 1.24), with a moderate nightly variability (SD ≈ 93 minutes, Z ≈ -0.19) and a median sleep start around 00:18 with modest start-time variability (SD Z ≈ -0.37). These objective sleep metrics (long duration, reasonable regularity) are generally associated with lower perceived stress in population-level analyses (sleep duration correlation with PSS near zero to slightly negative). Circadian rhythm summaries derived from heart rate show above-average amplitude (Amplitude Z ≈ 1.11) and positive day-to-day structure (Interdaily Stability Z ≈ 0.58; Autocorrelation 24 h Z ≈ 0.81). Higher amplitude and stronger 24-hour regularity have modest negative correlations with PSS (amplitude r ≈ -0.16; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12), indicating that the participant’s robust circadian pattern is consistent with lower perceived stress despite the self-reported PSQI elevation.

Cardiovascular and activity-derived signals:
Resting heart rate is near the sample mean (RHR = 59 bpm, Z ≈ 0.10), so cardiovascular baseline does not suggest elevated autonomic arousal. The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (large negative deviations overnight) and distinct daytime peaks, especially mid-day and early evening (notably 12–1 pm Z ≈ 2.19 and 6–7 pm Z ≈ 1.87). This high amplitude of daytime vs nighttime deviation indicates a clear day–night contrast in physiological arousal and is consistent with the elevated cosinor amplitude metric. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (IV Z ≈ 0.53), and IV correlates positively but weakly with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), so this feature provides a small counterpoint to the general pattern but is not large enough to offset the stronger signals of circadian regularity.

Behavioral context and potential stress-relevant habits:
The participant reports modest but regular social and physical activity (socializing ~1–2 hours, some sports/exercise ~1–2 times/week, exercise-with-others ~1–2 times/week), and low use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Alcohol (wine/liquor) use is reported at ~1–2 times/week (Z ≈ 0.94). These behavioral patterns—regular social contact and moderate activity—tend to be protective or neutral with respect to perceived stress. Some leisure activities such as listening to music and reading are reportedly not done, which may reflect personal preference rather than stress-related withdrawal, given the otherwise low symptom scores.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress (PSS):
Multiple independent indicators point toward a relatively low-to-average level of perceived stress for this participant. Low CES-D and STAI scores, high self-esteem, objective long and regular sleep, above-average circadian amplitude and day-to-day rhythm stability, and clear daytime physiologic activation all align with the lower end of the PSS distribution (many of these features have modest negative correlations with PSS in the sample). Moderately elevated intradaily variability and a PSQI in the “disturbed sleep” range are small opposing signals but are of lower magnitude relative to the consistent pattern of low mood/anxiety and strong circadian organization. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports that the participant’s PSS score would fall in the bottom half of the study population distribution (i.e., relatively low or average perceived stress).

28327,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Summary of self-report psychological profile:
The participant’s self-report battery shows multiple indicators that are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden is high (CES-D = 33, Z = +2.05) and trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 58, Z = +1.65); both CES-D and STAI scores have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28 and r ≈ 0.31, respectively), supporting their relevance to perceived stress. Self-esteem is relatively low (Rosenberg = 26, Z = −1.71) and current happiness is low (self-rated happiness Z = −1.61); these measures show modest negative correlations with PSS in the sample. The participant also reports poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9, classified as disturbed sleep, Z ≈ +1.05) and low satisfaction with physical health. Taken together, the self-report profile (high depressive and anxiety symptoms, low self-esteem and happiness, disturbed subjective sleep) is consistent with elevated perceived stress at the individual level.

Objective sleep and sleep–wake timing:
Fitbit-derived sleep data present a nuanced pattern. Median nightly duration (7 h 37 m, Z ≈ +0.54) is slightly above the study mean, and mean daily naps are minimal; sleep duration variability and sleep-start variability are not unusually high. However, the participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 00:54), and subjective sleep quality is poor. This pattern—objectively sufficient total sleep time but late timing and perceived disturbed sleep—often co-occurs with stress-related sleep complaints and can reflect difficulty achieving restorative sleep despite adequate duration. The sample-level correlation between subjective sleep disturbance and PSS is consistent with subjective sleep complaints being linked to higher perceived stress.

Circadian and hourly cardiac rhythm features:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show moderate regularity in day-to-day timing (interdaily stability = 0.49, Z ≈ +0.67) but elevated intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.69, Z ≈ +1.02). Higher intradaily variability in this sample is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), suggesting that greater within-day rhythm fragmentation is linked to higher perceived stress. Cosinor-derived amplitude is relatively large (amplitude Z ≈ +1.04) with a mesor near the sample mean (MESOR ≈ 76.8, Z ≈ +0.38) and an acrophase in the late afternoon/early evening (≈5:17 PM). Resting heart rate is near-average (≈60 bpm, Z ≈ +0.24). These circadian features indicate a pronounced day–night contrast in heart rate but with fragmentation across the day, a pattern that can reflect irregular activity/rest transitions or brief periods of physiological activation across days.

Hourly heart-rate deviations and inferred arousal timing:
Aggregated hourly deviations from mesor show expected nocturnal suppression of heart rate overnight (large negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and pronounced positive deviations in the evening, especially between 6–8 PM (Z-scores up to +2.24 at 7–8 PM). The evening heart-rate elevation is a notable physiological pattern suggesting repeated periods of heightened cardiovascular arousal across days in the early evening. Given modest positive correlations between some evening heart-rate deviations and PSS (and a negative correlation for some daytime hours), the timing of physiological activation in the evening aligns with a profile where stress-related arousal may be concentrated later in the day (evening), potentially affecting subjective sleep initiation and sleep quality.

Behavioral context and coping-related habits:
Behavioral reports show modest alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week), low recreational drug use, and low-frequency exercise (exercising alone/with others ~1–2 times per week). The participant spends appreciable time listening to music and moderate time online; socializing time is lower than average. Low health satisfaction, low happiness, and limited regular recreational/social buffering activities may reduce resilience to stress. The combination of elevated internalizing symptoms with relatively limited social recreation and only modest physical activity suggests fewer behavioral buffers against stress.

Integrated interpretation regarding perceived stress:
Multiple converging signals point toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study population. High CES-D and STAI scores (both strongly above the sample mean and positively correlated with PSS), poor subjective sleep, low self-esteem and happiness, and circadian/physiological indicators of intraday fragmentation with recurrent evening arousal create a consistent picture that aligns with higher perceived stress. Objective sleep duration alone does not suggest sleep deprivation, but the late sleep timing, disturbed subjective sleep, and evening physiological activation are patterns commonly linked to greater perceived stress. Behavioral factors (limited socializing, modest exercise, some alcohol use) provide little evidence of strong stress-buffering routines. On balance, the evidence supports classification of this participant’s perceived stress in the upper half of the study distribution.

Final classification (PSS group):

52302,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report profile and behavioral context: The participant’s self-report profile presents a mixed pattern of risk and protective factors for perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, z ≈ +0.17) is slightly above the study mean, which—given its modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.31)—is a notable contributor to higher perceived stress. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 7, z ≈ −0.66), and global self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, z ≈ +0.11), both of which are features that typically buffer against elevated stress. The participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, above common cut-off), suggesting sleep-related complaints despite objectively long median nightly sleep. Lifestyle indicators show little substance use (no alcohol/drug use reported), moderate exercise (1–2×/week), elevated socializing (3–4 hours/day, z ≈ +1.74), and relatively high passive media time (TV/videos and video gaming both elevated). These behavioral elements point to social engagement and healthy low substance exposure but also late-night schedules and leisure patterns that may interact with stress and sleep quality.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian, and cardiovascular features: Objective sleep is characterized by long median nightly duration (8 hr 6 min; z ≈ +1.14) and variable timing (median sleep start ~01:08 AM; sleep start SD ≈ 103 minutes, z ≈ +0.43), which aligns with the elevated PSQI score—long sleep quantity with poorer subjective quality and irregular timing. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.5 bpm; z ≈ −0.67), and population-relative MESOR is slightly below average (71.9; z ≈ −0.28), consistent with generally lower baseline cardiovascular tone. Circadian-derived measures show moderate amplitude (z ≈ +0.50) but reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.33) and low intradaily variability (z ≈ −0.95). Together these suggest a circadian rhythm with a reasonably strong day–night amplitude but somewhat inconsistent day-to-day timing and low within-day fragmentation. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal dips (largest negative deviations in the 4–7 AM window) and relatively large positive deviations across early- to mid-afternoon (peaks 1–3 PM; z up to ≈ +1.8), consistent with concentrated daytime activity or arousal and late-night sleep timing.

Integrated interpretation for perceived stress (PSS) placement: Evidence for elevated perceived stress includes the modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), both of which correlate positively with PSS in this sample. Objective markers are mixed: long overall sleep duration and low resting HR are not typical markers of high perceived stress, but irregular sleep timing and reduced interdaily stability (z ≈ −0.33) align with sleep–circadian disruption that often accompanies higher stress. Behavioral context—high social time and minimal substance use—are more protective, while late average sleep timing and elevated passive media use may reflect or maintain stress-related routines. Overall, the balance of small but consistent risk signals (trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, circadian irregularity) alongside fewer or opposite-direction protective indicators suggests the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the PSS distribution rather than the lower half. The pattern is not extreme, but the converging signals favor classifying this participant as having relatively elevated perceived stress compared with the study population.

46418,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report data show a mixed picture of affective and behavioral risks relevant to perceived stress. The participant reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 18, Z = 0.49) but a comparatively low trait anxiety score (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33). Self-esteem is near the sample mean (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03). Subjective sleep disturbance is pronounced (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98) despite other indicators of adequate sleep duration (see wearable-derived metrics below). Current self-reported happiness is slightly above average (Z = 0.55) while global health satisfaction is below average (Z = -1.2). The participant endorses frequent team/partner exercise and sports (Zs = 1.23 and 1.58 respectively), which, in this sample, show weak negative correlations with PSS. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine 1–2 times/week) and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart rate metrics indicate a well-structured, high-amplitude circadian profile with low fragmentation. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.53, Z = 1.0) and intradaily variability is low (0.30, Z = -1.73), consistent with regular day-to-day patterns and limited within-day rhythm fragmentation. Cosinor parameters also show above-average amplitude (15.07, Z = 1.39) and a mesor modestly above the sample mean (78.2, Z = 0.58), with an acrophase in the early evening (≈5:55 PM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.8 bpm, Z = -0.04). Across-hour deviations from the mesor reveal a deep nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations in the early morning hours) and a prominent evening peak (notably 5–6 PM with a large positive deviation, Z = 2.27). In this dataset, higher interdaily stability and amplitude show small negative correlations with PSS, and low intradaily variability (as observed here) aligns with lower PSS associations.

Sleep behavior shows objective and subjective divergence. Objective sleep duration is adequate to slightly above average (median 7 h 44 min, Z = 0.69) with low night-to-night variability (SD = 64 min, Z = -0.84) and few naps (Z = -0.86), suggesting consistent sufficient sleep opportunity. However, the participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 1:49 AM) and subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI high). This mismatch—adequate duration and regularity together with high subjective disturbance—can reflect sleep fragmentation, sleep quality complaints, or misalignment between desired and actual sleep timing; in this sample poor subjective sleep commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress but objective regularity and duration are typically protective.

Weighing evidence for likely perceived stress level: indicators consistent with lower or average PSS include low trait anxiety, strong and regular circadian rhythms (high interdaily stability, high amplitude, low intradaily variability), low resting heart rate, regular sleep duration, frequent social/structured physical activity, and modestly elevated self-reported happiness. Indicators consistent with higher PSS are elevated subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) and a modest elevation in depressive symptomatology (CES-D). Correlations in the dataset suggest the circadian regularity and activity patterns observed here are associated with lower PSS, while PSQI and CES-D have positive associations with PSS but are more modest in magnitude.

Holistic interpretation: the balance of objective physiological and behavioral markers that most strongly relate to lower perceived stress (robust circadian structure, low fragmentation, low resting heart rate, regular sufficient sleep duration, and frequent exercise/social activity) outweighs the moderate subjective sleep complaints and subclinical depressive symptom burden. Overall, the multimodal profile suggests the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study population on perceived stress (bottom 50).

93002,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"Self-report measures present a mixed profile with modest affective symptoms but notable sleep complaints. The participant’s CES-D score (14) and STAI–Trait score (40) are close to the study population mean (z-scores ≈ 0.07 and −0.13 respectively), indicating only mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms and average trait anxiety relative to peers. Self-esteem is lower than typical in this sample (RSES score z ≈ −0.87), and subjective sleep quality is substantially poorer than average (PSQI = 9, z ≈ +1.05) indicating clinically relevant sleep disturbance. Lifestyle responses suggest limited substance use, modest social exercise frequency, moderate internet use, and generally engaged academic performance (GPAs in the 3.3–3.7 range). Taken together, self-report suggests some vulnerability in self-regard and clear sleep-related complaints but otherwise only average mood/anxiety symptom burden.

Wearable-derived circadian and resting physiology emphasize a relatively low baseline cardiovascular state and regular daily structure. Resting heart rate and the cosinor MESOR are both low relative to the cohort (RHR = 48.3 bpm, mesor z ≈ −1.2), which typically reflects good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic sympathetic activity. Nonparametric circadian features (interdaily stability z ≈ +0.67; autocorrelation at 24 h z ≈ +0.81) indicate a fairly regular and stable 24-hour heart rate rhythm across recording days. Intradaily variability is near average (z ≈ +0.24). In this dataset higher interdaily stability and higher 24-hour autocorrelation show small negative correlations with perceived stress, so the participant’s relatively strong rhythm stability is a feature generally associated with lower PSS in this sample.

Sleep timing and quantity show features consistent with sleep restriction and evening timing that could contribute to perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is about 6 h 28 min (z ≈ −0.88) with a late median sleep start (~01:16 AM) and substantial night-to-night variability in sleep timing (start-time SD z ≈ +0.43). Mean daily naps are somewhat elevated (z ≈ +1.21). The combination of objectively short sleep, late bedtime, and greater napping aligns with the participant’s elevated PSQI and represents a plausible pathway for elevated subjective stress or decreased coping capacity even when other physiological indicators are favorable.

Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime elevations, with particularly large positive deviation in the early evening (7–8 PM; z ≈ +2.16) and a midday peak (12–1 PM; z ≈ +1.61). The large evening deviation may reflect routine evening activity or heightened physiological arousal during that time window; however, in this study sample the correlation between evening heart rate deviations and PSS is small and negative, so that specific pattern alone does not strongly predict higher perceived stress. Early-morning larger negative deviations from mesor (deep nocturnal troughs) further emphasize a low baseline heart rate during sleep.

Holistic synthesis and PSS-group inference: evidence is mixed. Indicators favoring higher perceived stress include substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9), objectively shortened nightly sleep, late and variable sleep timing, and lower self-esteem—each of which has plausible links to elevated perceived stress. Conversely, objective cardiovascular markers and circadian regularity (low resting heart rate, low mesor, high interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation), limited substance use, preserved academic performance, and only average depressive/anxiety symptom scores argue against markedly elevated perceived stress. On balance, the balance of objective physiological and behavioral markers that are inversely associated with perceived stress (notably the strong rhythm stability and low resting heart rate) alongside average mood/anxiety scores suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of PSS values in this study population rather than the upper half. Therefore the participant’s overall PSS score is more consistent with the bottom 50% of the study distribution.

56543,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"Self-report measures indicate a pattern of elevated internalizing symptoms that are typically associated with greater perceived stress. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and depressive symptom score (CES-D = 18, Z = 0.49) are both above the study mean and show positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (STAI: r ≈ 0.31; CES-D: r ≈ 0.28), suggesting these emotional symptom domains are likely contributing to higher stress perception. Self-esteem is below average (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73), which can confer vulnerability to stress, while reported overall health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 0.88), indicating some retained positive appraisal of physical health that may buffer stress to a degree.

Objective physiological data from the wearable point toward elevated basal arousal and pronounced evening/late-night activation. Resting heart rate (68 bpm, Z = 1.17) and MESOR (82.27 bpm, Z = 1.14) are both higher than the study mean (small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS are reported), indicating a higher-than-average cardiovascular baseline. Aggregated hourly deviations show especially large positive deviations in the late evening (notably 9–10pm and especially 10–11pm: +26.8 and +44.2 bpm, Z = 3.28 and 5.94 respectively), implying substantial evening physiological activation relative to the mesor. Night and early-morning hours show the expected negative deviations, but the magnitude of late-night elevations is an atypical feature consistent with bedtime arousal or late-evening behavioral activation.

Sleep timing and duration reinforce a profile that can amplify perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is slightly short (6 hr 26 min, Z = -0.94) and self-report sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep). The median sleep start time is very late (~02:22 AM) with moderate variability, and sleep duration variability is nontrivial. Late sleep onset combined with objectively elevated evening heart rate and extensive evening internet use suggests behavioral and physiological factors that could maintain hyperarousal and interrupt recovery, both of which are commonly associated with higher PSS.

Daily behavior patterning shows mixed influences. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more, Z = 1.07), which is generally protective and may moderate stress. However, leisure and screen behaviors are notable: internet usage is high (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.19), and late-night physiological activation plausibly aligns with extended evening screen time. Reading time is unusually high (2–3 hours, Z = 4.24) and is negatively correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.23), which could be a mitigating factor. Circadian rhythm summary metrics show moderately high interdaily stability (Z = 0.67) alongside modest intraday variability (Z = 0.32); this pattern indicates some regularity in day-to-day rhythm but also fragmentation within days, a combination that can coexist with elevated arousal and disturbed sleep.

Integration and inference regarding perceived stress: multiple converging indicators point toward relatively elevated perceived stress. Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep quality, late sleep timing with short sleep duration, high evening physiological activation (very large HR deviations late at night), and high internet use together form a coherent signal associated with higher PSS. Protective signals (frequent exercise, high reading time, and above-average health satisfaction) are present but appear insufficient to counterbalance the weight of anxiety, sleep disturbance, and sustained evening arousal. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports classification of this participant’s perceived stress as in the upper half of the study distribution.

89142,0.0,0.0051813471502590676,"Self-report psychological profile: The participant reports a modest burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12; Z ≈ -0.14) but a relatively elevated trait anxiety score (STAI = 48; Z ≈ 0.66). Self‑esteem is below the study mean (Rosenberg = 32; Z ≈ -0.87). Health satisfaction is an outlying low value (score = 1; Z ≈ -2.45). Taken together, these self‑report measures present a mixed picture: depressive symptoms are not elevated, but trait anxiety and reduced self‑esteem and very low perceived physical health are psychological features that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress (the STAI → PSS correlation in this sample is the largest reported at ~0.34; CES‑D → PSS ~0.29; self‑esteem → PSS ~ -0.18).

Sleep and sleep perception: Objective Fitbit-derived sleep is short (median nightly sleep ≈ 5 h 50 m; Z ≈ -1.68) with a late median sleep onset (~01:02). Sleep timing shows modest night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 60 min; Z ≈ -0.49). Despite objectively short sleep, the participant’s self‑reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI = 4; Z ≈ -1.26) indicates better-than-average subjective sleep quality. Short objective sleep duration has a small relationship with higher PSS in this dataset (sleep duration → PSS corr ≈ -0.11), so the combination of short objective sleep and late timing provides a modest signal that could contribute to elevated perceived stress even though subjective sleep quality is relatively good.

Circadian and cardiovascular regulation: Heart‑rate circadian metrics indicate a relatively low overall level of cardiovascular activation (mesor ≈ 60.1 bpm; Z ≈ -1.89) and a low resting heart rate (≈ 45.6 bpm; Z ≈ -1.49). Rhythm regularity indices are not disrupted: interdaily stability is slightly above the sample mean (0.45; Z ≈ 0.33) and intradaily variability is lower than average (0.44; Z ≈ -0.74), consistent with a fairly regular, consolidated daily pattern. Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected overnight reductions (large negative deviations from mesor between ~12–6 AM) and a clear morning rise into daytime peaks (largest positive deviations in late morning to afternoon). These objective circadian and cardiac features—lower resting HR and relatively stable day‑to‑day structure—are, in this sample, weakly associated with lower perceived stress (e.g., interdaily stability and intradaily variability correlations with PSS are small and in directions indicating more stable rhythms relate to lower PSS).

Behavioral habits and lifestyle: The participant reports minimal substance use and little involvement in team sports or exercise (exercise items all “Not at all”; Zs strongly negative). Daily recreational patterns include above‑average time reading (Z ≈ 2.28) and some engagement with video games (Z ≈ 1.71), while socializing and other recreational activities are not prominent. Lower physical activity combined with low health satisfaction could reflect a subjective sense of poorer physical functioning; in this dataset poorer health satisfaction is modestly associated with higher PSS (corr ≈ -0.12). Some leisure activities that correlate with lower stress in the sample (reading, light media use) are elevated here and may buffer stress to a small degree.

Integrated assessment regarding perceived stress: Evidence is mixed but leans toward relatively elevated perceived stress. The strongest single indicator favoring higher PSS is elevated trait anxiety (STAI), which shows the largest positive correlation with PSS (≈ 0.34) and is above the study mean for this participant. Low self‑esteem and very low health satisfaction further point toward greater perceived stress, and objectively short sleep duration and late bedtimes provide an additional modest risk signal. Countervailing evidence includes regular circadian structure, low intradaily variability, low resting heart rate, and a relatively good subjective sleep quality (PSQI), which are associated in this sample with lower perceived stress but have weaker correlations. Balancing these signals, the psychological self‑report indicators with meaningful associations to PSS (notably trait anxiety and health dissatisfaction) are prominent enough to favor placement in the higher half of the PSS distribution.

24898,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"Psychological self-report and trait indicators show a mixed profile with modest elevations on measures that typically align with higher perceived stress and several protective psychosocial resources. The participant’s STAI–Trait score (45; Z = 0.37) is slightly above the study mean, reflecting elevated trait anxiety relative to peers; trait anxiety in this sample correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), so this feature favors higher perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D is near the sample average (score = 14; Z = 0.07) and therefore provides little directional leverage. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 31; Z = −1.01), and lower self-esteem in the sample shows a modest negative correlation with stress-protective effects (r ≈ −0.15), which—interpreted inversely—also points toward greater vulnerability to perceived stress. Conversely, current self-rated happiness (Z = 0.55) and above-average health satisfaction (Z = 0.88) are psychosocial resources that typically associate with lower perceived stress (happiness correlates negatively with PSS in the sample), partially counterbalancing the anxiety and self-esteem signals.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are largely protective and unlikely to drive a high PSS classification. The participant reports frequent physical activity and sport participation (exercise and sports Z-scores between ≈1.1 and 1.6), low substance and non-prescribed drug use, and moderate-to-strong social engagement (socializing Z ≈ 0.95). These behaviors are generally associated with reduced perceived stress and better coping. Leisure patterns show very high time spent listening to music and above-average reading, which may reflect adaptive restorative activities. Academic performance (GPAs) is high, suggesting functional academic adjustment. Overall, the behavioral data tip toward lower or average perceived stress rather than marked elevation.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics indicate a well-entrained and robust daily rhythm with physiological signatures consistent with low-to-moderate stress burden. Interdaily stability is high (0.65; Z = 1.99), intradaily variability is low (0.34; Z = −1.45), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (Z ≈ 0.81); these features describe consistent day-to-day structure and low fragmentation in heart-rate rhythms, characteristics that correlate weakly but negatively with PSS in the sample (i.e., greater regularity → lower perceived stress). Amplitude of the cosinor fit is relatively high (Z = 1.64) indicating pronounced day–night contrast in cardiovascular activity. Resting heart rate is low (49.4 bpm; Z = −1.04), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregated deviations show large negative overnight deviations and clear daytime peaks (notably in afternoon/early evening with several timeslots Z > 1), reflecting consolidated nocturnal downregulation and daytime activation. Together these act as physiological evidence for stable circadian regulation and cardiovascular fitness, both of which are typically protective against high perceived stress.

Sleep metrics present a small potential risk area but are not strongly deviant. Median nightly sleep duration is on the shorter side (6 h 14 m; Z = −1.18) and subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) crosses the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep; subjectively reported sleep problems have modest associations with perceived stress in the sample. However, sleep timing is relatively consistent (sleep start SD Z ≈ −1.07) and nap behavior is negligible (Z ≈ −0.86), consistent with regular sleep scheduling. The combination of somewhat short sleep duration and a PSQI indicating some disturbance suggests partial sleep-related strain, which could modestly elevate perceived stress, but the effect size here is limited relative to the stronger protective circadian and behavioral signals.

Integration and assessment regarding PSS group placement: evidence supporting a higher PSS (top half) includes a modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ 0.37), relatively low self-esteem (Z ≈ −1.01), and a PSQI score indicating some sleep disturbance. These variables have nontrivial positive associations with PSS in the sample and point toward vulnerability. However, balancing these risks are several relatively strong protective factors: frequent exercise and sports participation (Z ≈ 1.1–1.6), high interdaily stability (Z ≈ 1.99) and low intradaily variability (Z ≈ −1.45) in circadian heart-rate patterns, low resting heart rate (Z ≈ −1.04), substantial social engagement, minimal substance use, and moderately high happiness and health satisfaction. Most of these protective features are associated with lower PSS in the sample and are present at moderate-to-large effect sizes (several Z-scores > 1). On balance, the weight of multilevel evidence (behavioral, social, and physiological) favors placement in the lower or median range of perceived stress rather than the upper half.

Conclusion: considering the combined pattern—some psychological vulnerabilities but stronger behavioral and physiological resilience—the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half (lower or average) of the study population distribution of PSS scores.

74413,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report indicators of affective state and trait vulnerability point toward relatively low perceived distress. The participant’s depressive symptom score (CES-D = 6; Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety score (STAI = 31; Z = -1.02) are both well below the study mean, and the Rosenberg self‑esteem score is elevated (RSES Z = 1.10). These survey measures have moderate correlations with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31; self‑esteem r ≈ -0.15), and the participant’s positions on these measures therefore suggest lower perceived stress relative to peers. Current happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (self‑report = 3.0, Z ≈ -0.53) and health satisfaction is notably lower (Z ≈ -1.20), which may reflect specific concerns about physical health or wellbeing, but these isolated low scores are smaller in magnitude and less directly predictive of high PSS than the low depression/anxiety and high self‑esteem.

Objective sleep behavior from the wearable is broadly adequate and consistent. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 34 minutes (Z ≈ 0.47), and night‑to‑night variability in duration is low (SD = 42 minutes, Z ≈ -1.34), indicating relatively stable total sleep time across the recording period. Median sleep start time centered around 00:32 with moderate variability (SD ≈ 67 minutes) is consistent with a somewhat late schedule but not unusually erratic. The participant did report somewhat disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 6, just above the common cut point), indicating a subjective perception of poorer sleep despite objective duration and consistency; PSQI shows a weak relationship with PSS in the cohort. Low mean daily naps further supports consolidated nocturnal sleep.

Cardiovascular and circadian metrics indicate mixed signals: circadian parametric features are near the sample mean (MESOR ≈ 75.2, amplitude ≈ 11.0) and the acrophase around 18:27 is within an expected evening peak. Non‑parametric rhythm measures show reduced interdaily stability (value = 0.36, Z ≈ -0.41) and elevated intradaily variability (value = 0.76, Z ≈ 1.51). High intradaily variability reflects greater within‑day fragmentation of heart‑rate rhythms and is positively associated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17), so this pattern suggests some physiological rhythm fragmentation that, in isolation, would be consistent with increased perceived stress. Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.33); because resting heart rate correlates modestly and positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), the participant’s lower resting heart rate provides evidence in the direction of lower perceived stress.

Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show a clear nocturnal nadir and afternoon/evening elevations, with particularly large positive deviations late in the evening (e.g., 22:00–23:00 deviation ≈ +22.05, Z ≈ 2.46; 00:00–01:00 ≈ +7.42, Z ≈ 1.32). The elevated evening heart‑rate deviations may reflect late‑evening physiological activation or activity close to bedtime and are consistent with the relatively late sleep onset time. Correlations between these hourly deviations and PSS are generally small and mixed (some slightly positive, some slightly negative), so while the pattern suggests late‑evening arousal, it is not a strong independent predictor of higher perceived stress in this dataset.

Lifestyle and behavioral factors tend to support a lower‑stress profile. The participant reports no recreational substance use, exercises alone three or more times per week (Z ≈ 1.07), engages in modest social activity (1–2 hours, near the mean), and reports relatively high time reading (Z ≈ 1.3) with very low internet and media use. These behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use, stable daily routine of activity and rest) are typically associated with lower perceived stress. The one potential behavioral concern is lower satisfaction with physical health (Z ≈ -1.2) and a BMI in the overweight range; these could contribute to some stress or health‑related worry but are not strongly predictive, given the other favorable psychosocial markers.

Integrated interpretation and PSS group assignment: weighing the evidence holistically, the strongest and most directly PSS‑relevant signals—low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, and high self‑esteem—consistently point toward relatively low perceived stress. Objective sleep duration and regularity and a low resting heart rate further lean toward lower PSS. Countervailing signals (elevated intradaily variability of heart rate, reduced interdaily stability, subjective sleep disturbance on PSQI, late‑evening heart‑rate elevations, and low health satisfaction) indicate some physiological and subjective irregularities that could contribute to stress but are smaller in magnitude or weaker predictors of PSS in this sample. On balance, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s perceived stress is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution.

77789,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"Self-report psychological and symptom measures indicate a profile consistent with elevated internalizing distress. The participant’s CES-D score (20; Z = 0.7) is in the range commonly flagged for increased depressive symptom burden, and the trait anxiety score on the STAI (43; Z = 0.17) is above average within the sample—both instruments show positive correlations with perceived stress in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Rosenberg self‑esteem is modestly below the sample mean (score = 36; Z = -0.31), which is directionally associated with greater perceived stress in the cohort (r ≈ -0.15). These converging self-report indicators (elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, somewhat lower self‑esteem) constitute moderate evidence for higher perceived stress relative to peers.

Sleep timing, quantity, and stability add further evidence suggestive of stress-related disturbance. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration was 6 h 32 min (Z = -0.8), below the sample median, and the PSQI score (6; classified as disturbed sleep) indicates subjectively poorer sleep quality. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:19) and sleep duration is highly variable across nights (SD ≈ 166 minutes; Z = 1.49), which is associated in this sample with higher PSS (sleep variability r ≈ 0.15). Taken together, objective short sleep, late bedtimes, and elevated night-to-night variability align with behavioral patterns frequently observed with increased perceived stress.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian features show physiologic signatures that align with increased arousal and reduced diurnal contrast. Resting heart rate and heart-rate mesor are elevated relative to the study population (resting HR = 68.7 bpm, Z = 1.25; mesor = 83.16, Z = 1.26), and the amplitude of the circadian rhythm is relatively low (amplitude = 7.73, Z = -0.99), indicating a blunted day–night heart rate difference. Elevated resting HR and blunted amplitude are modestly positively associated with perceived stress here (resting HR r ≈ 0.14; amplitude r ≈ -0.17). Interdaily stability is somewhat above average (0.49; Z = 0.67), and intradaily variability is lower than average (Z = -0.39), suggesting regular timing across days but diminished within-day amplitude—physiologically consistent with a sustained elevated baseline and reduced daytime/ nighttime contrast rather than fragmented circadian timing.

Behavioral and contextual features provide mixed but relevant information. The participant reports low levels of exercise and social activity, limited substance use, above-average time reading, and relatively high trust and self-reported happiness (happy score Z = 0.55). Academic performance is high (GPA near the top of scale). Health satisfaction is low (Z = -0.86) and BMI is elevated (27.45). Low physical activity, low health satisfaction, elevated BMI, and reduced sleep quantity/quality are factors that can compound perceived stress, even when some affective self-reports (e.g., happiness) are relatively positive. The constellation suggests that behavioral resources that buffer stress (exercise, social activity, health satisfaction) are limited while internal distress signals remain elevated.

Holistic assessment and conclusion regarding likely PSS placement: several moderately weighted indicators point toward higher perceived stress. The strongest direct contributors are the elevated depressive symptom score and trait anxiety (both positively correlated with PSS in the sample), objectively short and variable sleep with disturbed subjective sleep, and physiological signs of elevated baseline cardiovascular arousal combined with reduced circadian amplitude. Protective or neutral signals (high happiness Z, strong academic performance, low substance use) reduce the certainty but do not fully offset the pattern of symptom burden and physiologic arousal. Given the preponderance of evidence and the documented correlations in this dataset, the participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of the sample distribution for perceived stress (top 50%).

88882,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"Self-report and trait measures indicate a psychologically resilient profile. The participant reports very low depressive symptoms (CES-D score = 2, Z ≈ -1.18) and low trait anxiety (STAI-T = 28, Z ≈ -1.31), accompanied by relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ 1.1) and above-average momentary happiness (Z ≈ 1.64). Academic performance is strong (GPAs near 4.0) and health satisfaction is modestly positive. Substance use is limited to moderate, socially normative alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week; other substances seldom/never). Regular exercise (alone ≥3×/week) and low engagement in sedentary hobbies further characterize lifestyle behaviors that typically associate with lower perceived stress.

Objective sleep and subjective sleep quality present a contrast to the above. Median nightly sleep duration from the wearable is short (≈5 h 57 min; Z ≈ -1.53) and the reported PSQI score (6) crosses the common threshold for disturbed sleep. Sleep timing is markedly late (median sleep start ≈ 02:34) but with relatively low night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 40 min, Z ≈ -0.95). Daytime napping is minimal. Together these features describe a consistent late short-sleep pattern — a behavioral sleep pattern that can reflect scheduling choices or stress-related sleep compression and that is commonly associated with increased sleep-related distress, even when subjective mood and trait measures are favorable.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show both markers of physiological fitness and signs of circadian fragmentation. Resting heart rate and mesor are low (RHR ≈ 47 bpm, Z ≈ -1.28; mesor Z ≈ -1.22), consistent with good cardiovascular conditioning. At the same time, interdaily stability is lower than average (value 0.34, Z ≈ -0.57) and intradaily variability is elevated (value 0.63, Z ≈ 0.60), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (Z ≈ -0.78). This combination indicates a relatively regular amplitude but weaker day-to-day rhythm and more within-day fragmentation — physiologic patterns that can reflect irregular schedules, late-evening activity, or nocturnal arousals. The hourly heart-rate deviations show an unusually large positive deviation at 1–2 AM (Z ≈ 3.1), elevated evening HR between roughly 7–9 PM, and the expected troughs in the early morning; the 1–2 AM spike suggests intermittent nocturnal arousal or activity consistent with the late sleep onset.

Integrative interpretation for perceived stress: most robust indicators point toward relatively low or average perceived stress. Strong negative departures on depressive and anxiety trait measures, elevated self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise, and low resting heart rate are all associated (by their correlations and known relationships) with lower perceived stress. Contrasting signals include objectively short sleep duration, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6), late sleep timing, and circadian fragmentation (lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability). Those features are modestly correlated with higher PSS in the sample and could reflect situational pressures or lifestyle choices that increase physiological stress exposure, but their associations with PSS in this dataset are smaller in magnitude than the trait-level protective indicators. On balance, the preponderance and magnitude of evidence (notably the low CES-D and STAI trait scores and favorable self-concept measures) indicate the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study population on perceived stress.

19245,27.0,0.9481865284974094,"Summary of self-report psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports elevated symptom burden on mood- and anxiety-related scales relative to the study sample. The CES-D score is 26 (Z = 1.32) and the STAI–Trait score is 55 (Z = 1.35), both indicating greater depressive and anxiety symptom levels than most peers; both scales show positive correlations with PSS in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), which supports their relevance to perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is also worse than average (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are below the sample mean (self-esteem Z = -0.45; happiness Z = -1.61). Trust and overall health satisfaction are relatively low (trust Z = -2.07; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.78). Behavioral features include frequent solitary exercise (3+×/week; Z = 1.07) and relatively high socializing and music-listening times, along with moderate weekly alcohol consumption. Academically the participant has strong GPA history. Taken together, self-report measures emphasize a combination of elevated internal distress (depression/anxiety, low happiness) with some adaptive behaviors (regular exercise, social activity).

Objective sleep and circadian/physiological patterns from the wearable:
Wearable-derived metrics show a late and irregular sleep schedule with signs of evening physiological activation. Median sleep start time is very late (≈ 02:38 AM) and the standard deviation of sleep start is high (125 minutes, Z ≈ 0.92), indicating substantial night-to-night variability in sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long compared to peers (8 h 6 min, Z = 1.14) but with high variability in duration (SD 155 min, Z = 1.23). Mean daily naps are higher than typical (0.27 naps/day, Z = 2.27). Circadian regularity metrics are lower than average: interdaily stability is reduced (0.31, Z ≈ -0.82) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low, consistent with an irregular daily rhythm. Resting heart rate and mesor are both low (resting HR = 49.6 bpm, mesor = 66.4 bpm; Z ≈ -1.0 each), which commonly reflects good cardiorespiratory fitness. However, aggregated hourly deviations from mesor show substantial relative increases in evening and late-night heart rate (notably 10–11pm and 11–12am large positive deviations, Z > 1.9 and 2.25), and large negative deviations in the early morning, producing a pattern of elevated physiological arousal late in the night and pronounced quiescence in the early morning. This pattern (late-night HR elevations + irregular sleep timing) is consistent with subjective reports of disturbed sleep and with circadian irregularity.

Integration and implications for perceived stress:
Several converging signals indicate a higher likelihood of elevated perceived stress. Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (both Z > 1.3) are moderately correlated with PSS in the sample and are strong individual predictors of higher perceived stress in analogous datasets. Subjective sleep disturbance and objective markers of irregular and late sleep timing (high sleep start variability, late median sleep onset, increased napping) align with known behavioral correlates of increased stress and are modestly positively correlated with PSS in the dataset. Physiologically, pronounced evening heart-rate elevations relative to this participant’s low mesor/resting HR suggest increased evening arousal that could reflect stress-related activation or poor wind-down, which is consistent with disrupted subjective sleep and with elevated anxiety scores. On the other hand, there are protective/mitigating features: frequent exercise, active social time, strong academic performance, and a low resting HR that may buffer some effects of stress. Nevertheless, the magnitude and consistency of signals associated with distress (high CES-D and STAI, disturbed sleep, nocturnal physiological activation, low momentary happiness and trust) collectively favor an interpretation of above-average perceived stress.

Assessment relative to the study distribution:
Evidence for lower or median PSS (bottom 50): longer median sleep duration, frequent exercise, strong academic outcomes, and low resting HR are characteristics that could be consistent with lower perceived stress in some individuals. None of these, however, strongly contradict the larger pattern of elevated internal distress and sleep/circadian dysregulation in this participant.

Evidence for higher PSS (top 50): elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (both Z > 1.3), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), late and irregular sleep timing with increased napping, and evening physiological arousal (large positive HR deviations late evening) are all consistent with higher perceived stress; depressive and anxiety scales show moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample, strengthening inference.

Holistic conclusion:
Balancing protective factors against multiple converging signals of internal distress, sleep disruption, circadian irregularity, and evening physiological activation, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress is likely in the upper half of the study population distribution.

Trait anxiety (STAI-T = 24, Z = -1.71) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 9, Z = -0.45) are both below the study mean, while self-reported happiness (5.0, Z = 1.64) and self-esteem (Z = 1.52) are elevated relative to peers. The participant reports regular, frequent exercise (three times/week or more across solo, group, and sports activities; Zs 1.07–1.58) and minimal substance use, both behaviors typically associated with lower perceived stress. Academic performance (GPAs in the mid-3.0s) and above-average health satisfaction (Z = 0.72) further support relatively effective functioning during the semester. One notable self-report risk is a PSQI score of 6 indicating some subjective sleep disturbance (commonly interpreted as clinically notable), and a pronouncedly low amount of time spent socializing with friends (15 minutes or less; Z = -2.2), which could reduce available social support — both features that can contribute to perceived stress in some individuals.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics present a mixed picture but do not strongly indicate elevated, chronic stress. Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.3 bpm, Z = -0.34) and MESOR is below average (69.4, Z = -0.62), which are typical of good cardiovascular fitness and lower basal physiological arousal. Circadian structure shows modestly reduced interdaily stability (0.37, Z = -0.33) and a small increase in intradaily variability (0.56, Z = 0.10), suggesting somewhat weaker day-to-day regularity and slightly more fragmented within-day activity; these features have small positive correlations with PSS in the study (intradaily variability corr ≈ 0.16). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations reveal expected nocturnal declines and pronounced evening peaks (notably 5–7 PM and late evening 10–12 PM with Z-scores up to ~3.5), consistent with elevated evening activity or arousal but not necessarily indicative of pervasive stress. Sleep duration from the wearable is slightly below average (median ≈ 6h54m, Z = -0.35) but with low night-to-night variability in sleep start time (SD ≈ 41 minutes, Z = -0.93), indicating consistent sleep timing despite somewhat short nightly duration; mean daily naps are absent.

Weighing the modalities holistically, the balance of evidence favors lower perceived stress relative to the study sample. Multiple robust indicators from self-report (low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, frequent exercise, low substance use, and good academic and health-satisfaction outcomes) point toward placement in the lower half of the PSS distribution. Wearable signals do introduce mild countervailing concerns (subjective sleep disturbance, reduced interdaily stability, elevated evening heart-rate peaks, and notably low socializing), but these are either small in magnitude, mixed in direction, or only weakly correlated with PSS in the cohort. Overall, the preponderance of evidence supports classification in the bottom 50% of perceived stress within this study population.

63347,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Self-report measures show a mixed but overall not-high stress profile. Depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07) is near the sample mean and below common cutoffs for depression, while trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) is modestly elevated relative to peers. Self-esteem is at the upper end of the scale (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and current happiness is above average (score 4.0, Z = 0.55), both factors that typically buffer perceived stress. The participant reports low substance use and limited social/recreational activities; exercise frequency is very low (Z scores around -1.6 to -1.9), which could reduce behavioral stress resilience but does not itself indicate high perceived stress in the context of other measures. Subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI = 7, Z = 0.13), and self-rated health satisfaction is below the mean (Z = -0.78), which are potential contributors to elevated perceived stress but are moderate in magnitude.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features generally indicate a well-structured and high-amplitude daily physiology. Interdaily stability (0.48, Z = 0.58) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.44, Z = 0.98) are above the sample mean, and intradaily variability is relatively low (0.35, Z = -1.38), suggesting consistent day-to-day rhythm and consolidated activity/rest patterns. Amplitude of the cosinor model is notably high (16.02, Z = 1.69) and mesor is elevated (82.2, Z = 1.13), with an acrophase in the early evening (≈5:43 PM). These circadian features—higher amplitude and stability and lower fragmentation—are generally associated with lower perceived stress in the population-level correlations provided (small negative correlations with PSS).

Heart-rate timing and nightly physiology show concentrated nocturnal reduction and an early-morning trough consistent with sleep, but with a late typical sleep onset and elevated evening cardiovascular activation. Aggregate hourly deviations indicate pronounced overnight decreases in heart rate (peak negative deviations around 3–7 AM) and strong late-evening increases (notably 7–8 PM with Z ≈ 2.29). Resting heart rate is slightly below average (56.9 bpm, Z = -0.15). The combination of a late median sleep start time (≈1:28 AM) and substantial night-to-night sleep variability (sleep duration SD ≈151 minutes, Z = 1.14) may reflect irregular sleep timing that can associate with higher perceived stress, even though the physiological circadian signal remains strong.

Integrating modalities, the balance of evidence favors a relatively average-to-lower perceived stress level within this study sample. Protective indicators include normal depressive symptom levels, above-average self-esteem and happiness, low substance use, and robust, stable circadian heart rate features (high amplitude and interdaily stability, low intradaily variability), all of which correlate weakly but directionally with lower PSS in the sample. Factors that could push perceived stress upward are modest trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, late and variable sleep timing, low exercise, and somewhat lower health satisfaction; these signals are present but moderate in magnitude. On net, the multimodal pattern — particularly the strong circadian structure and positive self-regard — is more consistent with placement in the bottom half of the PSS distribution (lower or average perceived stress) than with the top half.
