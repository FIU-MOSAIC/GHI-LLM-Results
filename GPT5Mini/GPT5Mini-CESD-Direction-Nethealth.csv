44869,-16.0,"Multimodal summary and overall pattern:
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures there is a consistent pattern of behavioral and physiological changes that align with increased affective and somatic strain relative to the prior wave. The participant’s baseline CES-D at the initial wave (22/60; Z = 0.9) anchors the profile in the higher-than-average range within this sample, and multiple concurrent signals in the current data point toward greater depressive symptom burden: higher perceived stress, reduced self-esteem, worse sleep quality subjectively and objectively, a shift toward later and less-entrained circadian timing, reduced regularity of daily activity rhythms, reductions in solitary exercise, increased sedentary and screen-based leisure, and elevated resting heart rate with greater evening/nighttime cardiovascular activation. A minority of measures (small increase in health satisfaction; modest reduction in trait anxiety score) do not offset the cumulative directionality of the other indicators.

Sleep and subjective sleep disruption:
Subjective sleep reports and Fitbit sleep metrics together indicate meaningful deterioration in sleep that is commonly associated with worsening depressive symptoms. The participant’s self-reported sleep latency rose to 60 minutes (Z ≈ 2.15) from ~20 minutes previously, an unusually large change in latency. Objective sleep also shortened: median nightly sleep dropped by about 1 hour 5 minutes (from 8 h 26 m to 7 h 31 m; Z-change ≈ -1.23). Sleep onset shifted dramatically later (median start moved ~1 h 33 m later to ~02:33), and although night-to-night variability in sleep duration and start-time decreased (smaller SDs), the later timing and longer subjective latency are clinically meaningful. The large subjective latency increase paired with shorter total sleep and later bedtimes supports increased sleep disturbance and difficulty initiating sleep — a waveform commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms.

Circadian rhythm and activity regularity:
Wearable circadian metrics indicate pronounced destabilization of daily structure. Interdaily stability fell substantially from 0.57 to 0.26 (Z-change ≈ -2.25), and autocorrelation at 24 hours also declined, indicating weaker day-to-day entrainment of activity rhythms. The cosinor amplitude decreased (from 8.39 to 6.14), and the acrophase shifted later (from ~4:57 PM to ~7:50 PM), together suggesting blunted amplitude and a delayed/phase-shifted rhythm. Intradaily variability decreased slightly, but the large loss in interdaily stability and phase delay imply overall circadian desynchrony and less predictable daily timing of activity — patterns that are associated with increased depressive symptomatology.

Cardiovascular arousal and physiology:
Resting heart rate increased to 77.9 bpm (Z ≈ 2.41), a substantial elevation relative to the study population. The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows relatively higher cardiac activity across late evening and night hours (e.g., peaks ~10–11 pm and overall higher nighttime values) compared with the previous wave. Elevated resting heart rate and heightened evening/nigh-time HR are consistent with increased physiological arousal, autonomic dysregulation, or reduced parasympathetic recovery, and they commonly co-occur with worsened mood and sleep disturbance.

Behavioral, psychosocial, and functional indicators:
Self-esteem decreased by 3 points on the RSES (from 40 to 37; Z-change ~ -0.53), and perceived stress rose modestly (+2; Z-change ≈ 0.9). Exercise behavior declined (no longer exercising alone; previously 1–2×/month), while several sedentary and screen-based activities increased (internet use, music listening, video gaming). Alcohol use increased slightly (wine/liquor from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month”). Trust ratings dipped marginally. Academic performance (GPAs listed) shows modest variation historically but no clear acute improvement that would counterbalance the other signals. The combination of reduced self-esteem, higher stress, decreased physical activity, and greater sedentary/screen time supports an interpretation of increased behavioral risk for depressive symptoms.

Evidence contrary to worsening and its interpretation:
A few measures point away from worsening depressive burden: trait anxiety decreased slightly (STAI -3), health satisfaction rose marginally, and some variability metrics (sleep start SD, sleep-duration SD) declined. The STAI decrease suggests reduced chronic anxiety proneness, which could mitigate depressive symptoms for some individuals; however, the magnitude of that STAI change is modest and the participant’s increased stress, larger sleep impairments, circadian destabilization, elevated resting HR, and decreased self-esteem outweigh the small anxiety reduction. Correlations provided in the dataset indicate mixed associations for specific deltas, but the strongest objective changes (interdaily stability Z-change ≈ -2.25; resting heart rate Z ≈ 2.41; subjective sleep latency Z ≈ 2.15) are each in directions typically linked to increased depressive burden.

Synthesis and conclusion about CES-D direction:
Weighing the evidence across modalities — pronounced subjective and objective sleep disruption (large increase in sleep latency, shorter sleep, later bedtimes), marked weakening of circadian entrainment (interdaily stability drop and phase delay), elevated resting heart rate and increased evening/night HR, reduced self-esteem, increased stress, decreased exercise, and greater sedentary/screen time — the preponderance of changes is consistent with an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. While a modest reduction in trait anxiety and small improvements in some subjective health satisfaction metrics exist, they are insufficient to offset the consistent pattern of physiological arousal, circadian and sleep disruption, and behavioral disengagement. Therefore the most parsimonious conclusion from the multimodal dataset is that the participant’s CES-D score has likely increased (worsened) relative to the prior data collection.

92552,31.0,"Multimodal self-report profile — psychological traits and subjective functioning:
Since the prior wave the participant shows large, directionally consistent negative changes on several self-report indices relevant to mood. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased by 15 points (45 → 60; Z‑score change +2.17), a change that has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D change in the dataset (delta correlation = 0.71). Self‑esteem on the Rosenberg scale fell markedly (44 → 26; Δ = −18, Z‑score of delta −3.31). The single‑item affect measure shifted from “happy” previously to “Not happy at all” now (Z‑score of delta −2.64). Perceived health satisfaction decreased substantially (3.22 → 1.11; Δ = −2.11, Z‑score of delta −2.0). Reported stress rose slightly (21 → 22). Collectively, the pattern of large increases in trait anxiety, large decreases in self‑esteem and subjective well‑being, and marked reductions in perceived health are all consistent with increased affective burden since the previous assessment.

Sleep — subjective and wearable-derived:
Objective sleep from the wearable decreased substantially: median nightly sleep duration fell from 7 h 49 min to 6 h 27 min (Δ = −2 h 38 min, Z‑score of delta −1.77) while night‑to‑night variability increased (sleep start SD increased from 94 → 172 min). Subjective sleep latency reports are highly elevated (reported latency 100 minutes, Z = 4.26), and the participant reports less perceived control over sleep. The median sleep start shifted earlier (03:48 → 02:33), but remains at a late circadian hour and variability increased, indicating more inconsistent timing across nights. These changes (large reduction in objective sleep duration, longer latency, and greater timing variability) are established behavioral correlates of increased depressive symptomatology and reduced daytime functioning.

Circadian structure and cardiovascular physiology:
Summary circadian features show mixed changes in rhythm regularity and amplitude. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation both decreased (interdaily stability 0.55 → 0.47; autocorrelation 0.47 → 0.32), indicating less reproducibility of day‑to‑day heart rate patterns. In contrast, mesor and amplitude increased (mesor +8.92; amplitude +2.10), and acrophase shifted earlier markedly (previously ~8:48 PM to ~5:12 PM), suggesting larger daily heart‑rate oscillation with an earlier peak time. Resting heart rate rose from 49 → 55.85 bpm (Δ = +6.85), and the aggregated hourly heart‑rate profile shows relatively elevated daytime rates (notable afternoon peaks ~2–4 PM). Increased resting heart rate and higher daytime cardiovascular activation alongside reduced day‑to‑day stability are consistent with greater physiological arousal and dysregulated autonomic tone, patterns often accompanying worsening mood symptoms.

Behavioral activity, social and health habits:
The participant reports reductions in social and physical activity: exercise frequency declined (exercising alone 1–2 times/week → 1–2 times/month; exercising with others discontinued) and time socializing decreased (1–2 hours → ~31 minutes). Sedentary hobby time increased. Substance use reports show a cessation of alcohol use (previously 1–2 times/week → not at all), an objectively positive change but one that may reflect lifestyle or social shifts rather than improved mood per se. BMI increased from 23.29 to 27.45 (Δ +4.16), and overall health satisfaction decreased notably. Reduced social contact, lower activity levels, and weight gain are behavioral patterns that frequently accompany increased depressive burden.

Synthesis regarding depressive symptom trajectory:
Multiple modalities converge toward greater affective and functional burden since the prior wave. The strongest signals are the large rise in trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES‑D change), the large drop in self‑esteem, the shift from “happy” to “not happy at all,” substantial objective sleep loss with greater timing variability, increased resting heart rate and daytime cardiovascular activation, and reductions in social and exercise behaviors. A minority of metrics are mixed or potentially favorable (cessation of alcohol use; amplitude increase in circadian rhythm), but these do not outweigh the consistent, large, and cross‑domain negative changes in affect, self‑perception, sleep, physiology, and behavior. Taken holistically, the pattern provides stronger evidence for an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave than for stability or improvement.

Conclusion — overall direction of change in CES‑D:
Based on the integrated evidence above (notably large increases in trait anxiety, large decreases in self‑esteem and subjective well‑being, marked sleep deterioration, elevated resting heart rate, and reduced social/exercise engagement), the overall depressive symptom burden is best characterized as increased relative to the prior assessment.

73158,1.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report and behavior:
Self-report measures indicate an overall pattern of maintained or improved psychosocial functioning relative to the previous wave. Perceived stress shows a substantial reduction (19 → 13; Z-change ≈ -0.83), and the participant continues to report being “very happy.” Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased marginally (24 → 25) but remains in the low range; the change is small in magnitude. Self‑esteem shows a minimal decline (50 → 49), again a very small change. Trust in others increased by 0.5 points and is above-sample-average (Z-change large positive). Academic performance (GPAs) is stable at a high level. Taken together, the self-report picture is characterized primarily by reduced perceived stress, stable high subjective well‑being, and only minimal adverse movement on anxiety and self‑esteem scales.

Sleep and circadian behavior:
Objective sleep from the wearable indicates an increase in median nightly sleep duration (≈6h11m → 6h47m, Δ ≈ +36 minutes) and an earlier median sleep start time (shift ≈ -1h50m). These changes plausibly reflect increased sleep opportunity/quantity and an earlier schedule. However, measures of regularity worsened: sleep start time variability and sleep duration variability both increased markedly (substantial increases in standard deviations), and non‑parametric circadian regularity (interdaily stability) decreased (0.53 → 0.42). Intradaily variability increased slightly. In short, the participant appears to be sleeping more overall and earlier on average, but with greater day‑to‑day variability and reduced circadian regularity — a mixed profile where quantity improved but temporal consistency deteriorated.

Physiology and daily activity rhythms:
Cardiovascular markers show modest change but remain in ranges consistent with a relatively low resting heart rate. Resting heart rate rose slightly (47.6 → 48.5 bpm) but remains well below sample mean (Z ≈ -1.25). Cosinor summary values show a small decrease in MESOR and a small increase in amplitude; acrophase shifted only slightly (midday peak remains near early afternoon). Aggregated hourly heart‑rate profiles retain a clear daytime elevation and nighttime trough, with some amplitude differences compared with the previous wave. The reduction in interdaily stability and small increase in intradaily variability indicate less consistent day‑to‑day activity/physiological timing, even though overall cardiovascular tone remains low.

Behavioral activity and social habits:
Physical activity patterns show an increase in exercising alone (from monthly to weekly) and maintained frequent group exercise; socializing time is unchanged. Recreational screen behaviors are mixed (less TV, slightly more video gaming). Substance use reports remain at “not at all.” Trust increased and subjective health satisfaction is unchanged. These behavioral shifts (more exercise, stable social engagement, low substance use) align with health‑promoting change.

Integration relative to depressive symptom burden:
The participant’s initial CES‑D score was at the floor (0/60), indicating minimal depressive symptom burden at baseline. Key proximal indicators that commonly covary with depressive symptoms point towards stability or improvement: a notable reduction in perceived stress, increased sleep duration, increased exercise frequency, increased interpersonal trust, unchanged high subjective happiness, and preserved low resting heart rate. Countervailing signals include increased day‑to‑day variability in sleep timing and circadian stability (which can be associated with mood risk), a very small rise in trait anxiety, and a trivial decline in self‑esteem. The provided correlations between individual metric changes and CES‑D change are generally small and do not indicate a strong, consistent signal of worsening depressive symptoms. One caveat is the negative correlation of the initial CES‑D with subsequent change (r ≈ -0.5), which means very low baseline scores can be associated with later increases in other samples; however, the multimodal behavioral and physiological evidence here is more consistent with maintained low depressive burden or modest improvement rather than a clear increase.

Conclusion — directional assessment:
Weighing the substantial decrease in perceived stress, increased sleep quantity, greater exercise, increased trust, and stable subjective happiness against modest increases in sleep/circadian irregularity and very small adverse changes in anxiety/self‑esteem, the preponderance of evidence supports that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not increased and is more consistent with stability or modest improvement.

22138,-10.0,"Multimodal psychological summary (self-report)
Across self-report instruments the most prominent change is a marked reduction in trait anxiety: the STAI–Trait score fell from 50 to 41 (Score Delta = -9, Z-Score of Delta ≈ -0.91). This change is one of the larger, reliably scaled shifts in the survey data and the provided delta-correlation for the STAI (0.72) indicates that decreases in anxiety in this sample are strongly associated with decreases in CES-D scores. Perceived stress also declined (24 → 19), and global health satisfaction increased (3.44 → 4.33), both of which are commonly linked with improved affect and functioning. In contrast, self-esteem declined moderately (RSES 42 → 38; Score Delta = -4), and generalized trust in others fell (2.83 → 2.33) with a large negative z-position relative to the study population. Where available, the change correlations suggest that the anxiety and stress reductions are more strongly predictive of CES-D improvement than the self-esteem and trust declines are predictive of CES-D worsening. Overall, the self-report pattern is mixed but weighted toward improvements in affective arousal and perceived health.

Sleep- and sleep-regularity findings (subjective + wearable)
Sleep duration shows small objective improvement: median nightly sleep increased by ~14 minutes (7:32 → 7:46) and the variability of sleep duration decreased substantially (SD 82 → 54 minutes), indicating more consistent sleep quantity. Subjective weekday sleep duration also increased (6.0 → 7.0 hours). Sleep timing shifted later on average (median sleep start ≈ 01:15 → 02:06, a ~50-minute delay), while night-to-night variability in sleep start time decreased (SD of start time reduced by ~55 minutes). These changes suggest later but more regular bedtimes and steadier total sleep. The delta correlations provided for sleep metrics are small or null, but clinically the combination of increased total sleep, and reduced variability, is more commonly associated with stabilization or reduction of depressive symptoms than with worsening.

Circadian and heart-rate physiology (wearable-derived)
Cosinor and non-parametric circadian indices present a mixed picture. Mesor (average level of heart rate rhythm) increased modestly (≈77.2 → 79.7 bpm) while amplitude decreased (≈12.8 → 10.4 bpm), which reflects a modestly elevated mean heart rate with a blunted day–night oscillation. Interdaily stability decreased slightly and intradaily variability was essentially unchanged, while 24-hour autocorrelation increased—together this points to slightly reduced day-to-day rhythm strength and lower amplitude of the cardiac circadian waveform. Resting heart rate rose by ~1.9 bpm. The hourly aggregated heart-rate profile shows higher values across many night and daytime hours relative to the previous period. These physiological shifts (higher overall HR, lower amplitude) can reflect increased tonic autonomic activation or reduced circadian amplitude; however, the correlations linking these wearable changes to CES-D change are small in the supplied data, so the physiological pattern is a modest cautionary signal rather than strong evidence of worsening mood.

Behavioral activity and social patterns (wearable + self-report)
Reported socializing time increased (from brief daily social contact to ~1–2 hours), which typically aligns with improved mood and social functioning. Concurrently, exercise with others decreased (previously ≥3×/week to 1–2×/week), and recreational videogame use increased markedly (from none to 2–3 hours daily). Substance use patterns were essentially unchanged. Changes in technology and leisure use were large (internet and TV time decreased; gaming increased), which could reflect a shift in how free time is spent rather than a clear directional change in mood. The increase in social time and decline in perceived stress and anxiety favor an interpretation of improved social-affective functioning, while the reduced group exercise and lower trust/self-esteem are potential countervailing influences.

Integrated interpretation and implications for CES‑D change
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward a reduction in affective arousal and subjective stress (notably the large STAI decrease, lower perceived stress, and higher health satisfaction), together with small objective sleep gains and reduced night-to-night variability—factors that usually accompany decreases in depressive symptom burden. Physiological indicators (slightly higher resting HR and reduced circadian amplitude) and declines in self-esteem and interpersonal trust are notable adverse signals, but their correlations with CES‑D change in the provided dataset are weaker or in the opposite direction compared with the anxiety/stress indicators. Given the relative magnitude and known predictive relationships (the STAI delta correlation with CES‑D change is large and positive), the preponderance of evidence supports an overall reduction or stabilization (not worsening) of depressive symptom burden compared with the prior wave.

Conclusion (direction of CES‑D change)
Based on the pattern of reduced trait anxiety, lower perceived stress, increased health satisfaction, more consistent and slightly increased sleep, and increased social time—alongside weaker physiological and interpersonal signals of concern—the balance of evidence supports that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not increased and is more consistent with stability or improvement.

31439,-4.0,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological traits and mood:
The participant’s self-report profile shows mixed signals. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased modestly (49 → 45), and momentary stress declined slightly (23 → 20); the single-item happiness rating shifted from “pretty happy” to “Happy.” However, there is a large and salient decline in global self-esteem (Rosenberg RSES) from 39 to 30 (score delta = −9, Z-score of delta = −1.64). This self-esteem change is one of the largest-magnitude shifts in the dataset and, per the provided delta correlation (−0.48), is empirically associated with worsening CES-D scores in the study sample. The initial CES-D score (16/60) is in the low-to-moderate range; the population-level correlation of the initial CES-D with subsequent change is −0.5 (higher baseline tending to predict decreases), but that population tendency does not negate the observed individual-level large drop in self-esteem, which is more directly linked to increases in depressive symptoms.

Paragraph 2 — Activity, social and recreational behaviors:
Behavioral engagement shows a notable reduction in physical activity: frequency of exercising alone and exercising with others dropped from approximately 1–2 times per week to less than 1–2 times per month. Recreational patterns are mixed — time watching TV/videos decreased substantially while internet usage increased; socializing time was essentially unchanged. Reduced exercise is behaviorally meaningful given its well-established relationship with mood and the large negative change in frequency here. Most substance-use behaviors remained stable. Overall, the behavioral engagement profile reflects lower active engagement (particularly exercise), which aligns with risk for increased depressive symptoms.

Paragraph 3 — Sleep (subjective and wearable) and circadian regularity:
Subjective sleep reports indicate longer sleep latency (10 → 30 min) and a reduction in typical weekday sleep duration (7 → 6 hours). In contrast, wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration increased modestly (6h41m → 7h05m), but night-to-night variability increased (SD 110 → 143 minutes). The participant’s median sleep start time shifted later by about 30 minutes. Circadian summary metrics show a small decline in interdaily stability (0.55 → 0.51) and an increase in intradaily variability (0.36 → 0.50), indicating more fragmented and less regular 24-hour heart-rate rhythms. Taken together, the sleep picture is mixed (objective duration slightly up, subjective latency worse, timing later, and increased variability), but the increase in sleep irregularity and latency alongside reduced perceived weekday sleep suggests impaired sleep quality and circadian stability — factors commonly associated with worsening depressive symptoms.

Paragraph 4 — Physiological arousal and heart-rate patterns:
Physiological markers indicate persistently elevated cardiovascular tone: resting heart rate is high relative to the sample (77.6 bpm, Z = 2.38) and MESOR is elevated (92.1, Z = 2.6), although both show small downward deltas. Hourly aggregated heart-rate values are elevated across many daytime hours compared with the previous wave, consistent with sustained sympathetic or autonomic arousal. Circadian amplitude increased slightly and 24-hour autocorrelation decreased a bit, consistent with a modest destabilization of the daily rhythm. Elevated resting heart rate and high MESOR are relevant because sustained physiological arousal and disrupted circadian organization are associated with greater depressive symptom burden.

Paragraph 5 — Synthesis and weighing of evidence regarding change in depressive burden:
The data present a mixed pattern: some indicators of improvement (lower trait anxiety, modest reduction in self-reported stress, slightly higher objective median sleep duration) co-occur with several indicators commonly linked to worsening depressive symptoms. The most notable negative signals are the large decline in self-esteem (a strong, moderately sized correlate of CES-D change in the sample), the marked reduction in exercise frequency, increased sleep latency and timing delays, greater night-to-night sleep variability, and evidence of less regular circadian organization combined with elevated resting heart rate. Because the self-esteem drop is large in magnitude and explicitly correlated with increases in CES-D in the provided correlation, and because behavioral and physiological markers (reduced activity, greater circadian fragmentation, elevated cardiac tone) align with increased depressive burden, the preponderance of evidence favors an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave despite isolated improvements in anxiety and reported stress.

46558,0.0,"Self-report measures show a mixed but concerning pattern in domains that commonly track with depressive symptom change. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased modestly (37 → 39), and the change in STAI has a relatively strong positive correlation with CES‑D change (Δ correlation = 0.72); this pattern is consistent with a change in the direction of greater depressive burden if STAI change drives CES‑D. Self‑esteem decreased substantially (35 → 31), and the sign and magnitude of the self‑esteem change (Δ = -4) combined with its negative correlation with CES‑D change (Δ correlation = -0.48) imply that the observed decline in self‑esteem is associated with an increase in CES‑D score. Reported subjective happiness shifted from “very happy” to “pretty happy” (Z‑score of the change -1.8), and this reduction in positive affect also aligns with indicators that predict increases in CES‑D (Δ correlation = -0.27 when interpreted with the negative change). Countervailing self‑report signals include a marked reduction in perceived stress (22 → 15; Δ = -7) and a small increase in health satisfaction (Δ = +0.56), both of which, given their correlations, suggest movement toward lower CES‑D scores. Overall, however, the largest and most directly depression‑relevant self‑report changes (increased trait anxiety, decreased self‑esteem, reduced happiness and some reduction in socializing) point toward worsening depressive symptom burden.

Objective sleep and circadian measures from the wearable indicate later, more variable sleep timing and a small reduction in central tendency of sleep duration. Median sleep duration decreased slightly (7:05 → 6:57) and median sleep start time shifted later by ~31 minutes, while night‑to‑night variability in sleep start increased noticeably (std dev 55 → 86 minutes). These changes in timing regularity (later and more irregular bedtimes) are commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms; the sleep‑start time change has a moderate negative Δ correlation with CES‑D (−0.40), which in the context of a later start time corresponds to an effect associated with higher CES‑D. The participant’s subjective sleep metrics (self‑reported latency, usual weekday duration, and perceived control over sleep) were essentially unchanged, suggesting the participant’s sleep quality perception has not tracked the modest objective destabilization in timing.

Circadian and heart‑rate findings indicate a modest reduction in rhythm stability with some reorganization of the diurnal pattern. Interdaily stability decreased (0.56 → 0.49) and autocorrelation at 24 hours declined (0.41 → 0.34), consistent with weaker day‑to‑day regularity of activity/physiology. The cosinor acrophase of heart rate shifted later by about one hour (from ~5:09 PM to ~6:09 PM), reflecting a later phase of the heart‑rate rhythm. Intradaily variability changed minimally. Resting heart rate declined (61.6 → 58.9 bpm), which is generally a neutral-to-positive physiological sign (reduced tonic cardiac arousal), but the aggregated hourly heart‑rate profile shows higher evening heart rates in the current period (notably 8–11pm elevated relative to prior), indicating increased evening physiological activation. Taken together, these wearable signals show decreased circadian regularity and later phase with lower baseline heart rate but elevated evening arousal—an ambivalent pattern where circadian disruption and later timing are features often linked to increasing depressive symptoms despite the lower resting heart rate.

Behavioral activity and social indicators provide additional context. The participant reports modest increases in solitary and group exercise from very low baselines, and increased time listening to music, both of which can be adaptive. However, reported socializing time decreased (2–3 hours → 1–2 hours) and alcohol use (beer) increased from monthly to weekly, changes that can be associated with worsening mood in some individuals. Academic performance (GPA) and BMI are stable. Overall, the behavioral changes are heterogeneous: some small potentially protective changes (more health satisfaction, reduced stress, slightly more exercise) coexist with reductions in social engagement, increased alcohol frequency, and media/hobby shifts.

Weighing all modalities, the balance of evidence favors an increase in depressive symptom burden between waves. The strongest signals pointing toward worsening are the increase in trait anxiety (Δ STAI with a large positive correlation to CES‑D change), the substantive decline in self‑esteem (Δ correlated with CES‑D change), decreased subjective happiness, later and more irregular sleep timing, and reduced circadian stability—features that collectively align with greater CES‑D scores. There are meaningful opposing signals (large reduction in perceived stress, increased health satisfaction, lower resting heart rate), but these have smaller correlations with CES‑D change or are of lesser relevance to core depressive symptom domains than the anxiety/self‑esteem and circadian/sleep disruptions. On balance, the multimodal profile indicates an overall shift consistent with increased depressive burden.

93699,3.0,"Multimodal self-report and behavioral measures show a mixed but overall modestly positive pattern relative to the prior wave. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased slightly (44 → 42), a small change but one with a strong population-level association to CES‑D change (delta correlation = 0.72), such that the observed anxiety reduction favors a concurrent reduction in depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem remained stable. Self‑reported stress increased by 5 points (13 → 18) and this change is directionally associated with increased CES‑D in the population (delta correlation = 0.25); thus elevated perceived stress is a countervailing signal that would push toward worsening mood. Global subjective indicators of wellbeing show improvement: health satisfaction rose substantially (2.78 → 4.33), BMI declined (−2.48), and the participant continues to report being “pretty happy.” Changes in social and recreational behaviors are small or nil (socializing time stable, alcohol frequency largely stable, exercise with others stable though solitary exercise decreased).

Objective sleep and sleep-related self-report indicate greater timing regularity with stable total sleep. Fitbit-derived median sleep duration is essentially unchanged (≈6 h 51 m → 6 h 54 m) and sleep duration variability decreased slightly; median sleep start advanced earlier by ~1.5 hours (00:59 → 00:30) and start-time variability narrowed. The earlier and more regular sleep timing aligns with population-level associations for lower CES‑D (sleep start delta correlation = −0.40). Subjective sleep control decreased marginally (Agree → Somewhat agree), and ideal desired weekday sleep decreased from 8 to 7 hours; neither of these shifts is large enough to outweigh the signal from timing regularity and stable duration.

Cardiovascular and circadian physiology from the wearable show increased circadian strength alongside modestly elevated tonic cardiovascular activation. Cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude increased (mesor Δ ≈ +4.9 bpm; amplitude Δ ≈ +1.3 bpm) and interdaily stability remained high, while intradaily variability declined (less fragmentation). These rhythm changes indicate a more robust and regular daily pattern of physiological activity, a pattern generally associated with more stable mood. Resting heart rate rose modestly (≈ +2.1 bpm) and aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show higher mean HR across much of the waking day, particularly in afternoon–evening windows; however, the correlations between these HR changes and CES‑D change are small in the sample (e.g., resting HR Δ correlation ≈ 0.02), so the clinical relevance of the small HR increases to depressive change is limited.

Synthesis and directional assessment: weighing signals that predict CES‑D change, the strongest positive evidence for decreased depressive burden is the reduction in trait anxiety (STAI) which, given its large delta correlation with CES‑D change (0.72), strongly favors improvement. Additional supporting evidence includes better health satisfaction, more regular and earlier sleep timing (sleep start Δ correlation = −0.40), and improvements in circadian robustness (lower intradaily variability, higher mesor/amplitude). Offsetting signals include a noticeable increase in self‑reported stress and modest increases in daytime heart rate/resting HR and reduced solitary exercise; these favor a potential increase in depressive burden but have weaker sample-level associations to CES‑D change or are smaller in magnitude relative to the anxiety and sleep/circadian signals. Given the balance of evidence — especially the robust association of the observed decrease in trait anxiety and the more regular sleep/circadian pattern with reductions in CES‑D — the overall multimodal pattern is more consistent with stable or decreased depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

84011,-2.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report psychological measures and lifestyle: Compared with the prior wave, the participant shows small but directionally positive changes on several self-report indices relevant to mood. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined from 44 to 41 points, a modest reduction in chronic anxiety proneness (score delta -3). Self-esteem increased from 33 to 35 on the Rosenberg scale, and reported health satisfaction rose slightly. The participant also reported a subjective increase in perceived control over sleep (from ""Disagree"" to ""Somewhat Agree""), and many daily recreation and socialization habits are stable or show small positive shifts (e.g., started listening to music, more frequent solo exercise). Reported overall stress score remained unchanged. A notable behavioral change is an increase in alcohol consumption frequency (beer: from ""not at all"" to ""1–2 times a week""; wine also increased), which represents a potential risk factor despite small correlations with CES-D change noted in the dataset.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian and cardiac physiology: Wearable sleep metrics indicate a modest reduction in median nightly sleep duration (current 8 h 6 m vs previous 8 h 28 m), while sleep timing became more regular: sleep start time standard deviation decreased substantially (from ~82 to 48 minutes), and median sleep start time shifted only a few minutes later. These changes indicate more consistent sleep timing with slightly shorter total sleep. Cardiac measures show a clear downward shift in mean cardiovascular tone: resting heart rate fell from 56.9 to 51.5 bpm (delta -5.4 bpm; Z-change ~ -1.1) and the MESOR of hourly heart rate declined similarly. Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show lower daytime heart rates in the current wave versus the previous wave, with one isolated elevated hour in the late evening; overall these patterns are compatible with lower basal physiological arousal and/or improved cardiovascular fitness. Circadian rhythm summary measures show small declines in interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours and a modest advance of the acrophase (earlier peak activity time), but intradaily variability is slightly reduced; collectively these circadian changes are subtle and do not indicate large-scale fragmentation.

Integration of behavioral and physiological signals relevant to depressive burden: Several converging signals support reduced or stable depressive symptom burden. The strongest self-report indicators tied to mood—lower trait anxiety and higher self-esteem—both shifted in directions typically associated with decreased depressive symptoms, and their reported delta correlations with CES-D change in the dataset point toward concordant changes. Physiological indicators (lower resting heart rate and lower MESOR) and improved sleep timing regularity also align with better overall regulation and lower chronic activation, which are commonly associated with improved mood. Contrasting signals include increased alcohol use and a small reduction in objective median sleep duration; these factors can associate with worsening mood in some contexts. The dataset also notes that a low initial CES-D score has a negative correlation with subsequent change (initial CES-D correlation with change = -0.5), implying participants with low baseline scores may show increases later — this is a statistical risk signal but not direct evidence of current worsening.

Overall directional assessment of CES-D burden: Considering the pattern across domains, the preponderance of evidence points toward stability or improvement in depressive-related symptom burden rather than a worsening. Key supporting elements are the reductions in trait anxiety, increases in self-esteem and perceived control over sleep, increased exercise frequency, improved sleep regularity, and lower resting heart rate/MESOR — all of which are plausibly linked to decreased CES-D scores. Against this, increased alcohol use and a modest reduction in sleep duration present potential risk factors, and the baseline low CES-D score statistically predisposes toward an increase in some participants; however, these negative signals are less numerous and generally smaller in magnitude than the positive changes. Holistically, the balance of multimodal behavioral and physiological data suggests that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has remained stable or decreased relative to the prior wave.

88008,7.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report psychological and lifestyle measures:
The participant shows a marked increase in trait anxiety (STAI trait: 48 → 56; +8 points, Z-delta = 1.27). This change is large relative to the sample and is strongly correlated with changes in CES-D (delta correlation = 0.72), indicating that rising anxiety is one of the clearest signals that could coincide with increasing depressive symptoms. Concurrently, global self-esteem decreased substantially (RSES: 33 → 27; −6 points, Z-delta = −1.09), a moderate-to-large change whose delta correlation (−0.48) is consistent with an association between falling self-esteem and worsening depressive burden. Other self-report indicators shifted in directions that align with increased burden: trust in others declined (−0.33), satisfaction with physical health declined notably (−1.11 on a 1–7 scale, Z-delta ≈ −1.08), and BMI increased slightly (+0.7). Reported stress levels were unchanged (20 → 20), and some social/behavioral items moved in mixed directions — socializing time increased (1–2 hrs → 2–3 hrs) which is typically protective, while sedentary hobby time increased substantially. Taken together, the strongest and most clinically salient self-report changes (increased trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, reduced health satisfaction and trust) point toward worsening mood-related functioning.

Objective sleep and sleep-regularity signals:
Wearable-derived sleep shows small, mixed changes. Median nightly sleep duration increased modestly (≈+18 minutes) and sleep start time variability decreased (SD of start time: 77 → 53 minutes), suggesting slight improvement in sleep regularity. Subjective sleep reports (normal weekday sleep ~6 hours, sleep latency ~20 minutes) remained essentially stable. These modest improvements in objective sleep duration and timing regularity would, if considered alone, be neutral-to-slightly protective with respect to depressive symptoms, but their magnitude is small relative to the larger psychological shifts noted in self-report.

Circadian and heart-rate–derived physiology:
Heart-rate circadian summary metrics indicate a modest flattening and greater fragmentation of the rhythm. Amplitude decreased (14.34 → 12.09) and MESOR fell slightly (75.93 → 73.99), consistent with reduced daytime–nighttime contrast in cardiovascular activity. Intradaily variability increased (0.28 → 0.40), indicating more within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology; interdaily stability changed minimally. The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows lower overnight and evening peaks compared with the prior wave and generally smaller differences across the day (consistent with the lower amplitude). Resting heart rate rose slightly (54.0 → 55.3 bpm). Patterns of increased intradaily variability and reduced amplitude have been linked in the literature to worse mood/greater depressive symptomatology; although correlations provided for these circadian deltas with CES-D change are small, the direction of physiological change aligns with the self-report indicators suggesting increased burden.

Behavioral markers and substance use:
Exercise frequency was maintained (exercising alone three times/week or more), which is a protective behavioral factor. However, alcohol use increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month” for both beer and liquor/wine, and sedentary leisure time rose substantially. Academic performance shows a small, gradual decline in GPA across semesters. Increased socializing time is a positive change (1–2 hrs → 2–3 hrs), potentially buffering mood; nevertheless, the overall behavioral picture is mixed with notable increases in sedentary leisure and modest increases in substance use that could contribute to worsening affect for some individuals.

Evidence arguments for a worsening CES-D score (increase):
- Large increase in trait anxiety (STAI +8) with a strong positive delta correlation to CES-D change (0.72) is a primary indicator pointing to increased depressive symptoms.
- Pronounced decline in self-esteem (RSES −6), whose delta correlation (−0.48) is consistent with an increase in CES-D when self-esteem falls.
- Reduced trust and reduced health satisfaction, and small physiological changes consistent with a flattened and more fragmented circadian profile (reduced amplitude, increased intradaily variability) which have been associated with worse mood.
- Increase in sedentary hobby time and new, though low-frequency, alcohol use are behavioral changes that can contribute to increased depressive burden.

Evidence arguments for stability or improvement (stable/decrease):
- Objective sleep duration increased slightly and sleep timing variability decreased, both of which are small changes that would generally favor stability or mild improvement.
- Exercise frequency was maintained at a relatively high level and socializing increased, both of which are protective behaviors and could counterbalance some risk.
- Resting heart rate and many circadian delta correlations with CES-D are small, so physiological changes alone do not definitively demonstrate worsening.

Holistic assessment and conclusion:
Weighing all modalities, the most salient and large-magnitude signals are the increase in trait anxiety and the decline in self-esteem, both of which have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D change and are commonly coupled with increases in depressive symptoms. Secondary signals (reduced trust, lower health satisfaction, increased intradaily variability, reduced amplitude) provide convergent support for worsening burden. Protective signals (small increases in sleep duration and socializing, stable exercise) are present but are smaller in magnitude and less directly correlated with CES-D change in the provided data. Although the participant’s initial CES-D (20/60) might predict some regression effects, the preponderance of large self-report changes and the direction of circadian fragmentation favor an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

83566,-32.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological analysis:

The self-report measures show several substantial and consistent improvements in affective and anxiety-related domains. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) fell markedly (62 → 42; delta = −20), a large change whose delta correlates strongly with CES-D change (0.71). Self-esteem increased substantially (+11 points on RSES), and the participant’s single-item happiness rating shifted from “not so happy” to “pretty happy.” Perceived stress decreased (24 → 18), and health satisfaction rose slightly. These subjective changes form a coherent pattern—reduced anxiety and stress, greater self-regard and reported happiness—that, given the provided correlations, would be expected to accompany a reduction in depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral life-style indicators are broadly stable or mildly improved. Socializing time and academic performance markers (GPA) remain strong; trust in others increased modestly. Exercise patterns shifted: frequency of exercising alone declined but exercising with others increased, which may reflect a move toward more socially embedded activity. Substance use shows only a small increase in occasional wine/liquor use; other substance categories remain “not at all.” Self-reported weekday sleep needs remained at an ideal 8 hours, and perceived sleep latency, control over sleep, and normal weekday sleep duration changed little or improved slightly (self-reported normal weekday sleep reported +0.5 hr). Subjective lifestyle changes therefore largely align with improved mood and decreased distress.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data present a nuanced picture. Median wearable-recorded sleep duration is high (≈8 hours) and only slightly changed; median sleep start time shifted later by roughly 18 minutes with reduced night-to-night variability in start time, while variability in sleep duration increased modestly. Circadian rhythmicity metrics show mixed small changes: interdaily stability is slightly lower (0.60 → 0.54) but 24-hour autocorrelation increased (0.26 → 0.37), and cosinor-derived MESOR and amplitude decreased slightly. These patterns indicate a largely preserved 24-hour structure with modest reductions in rhythm amplitude and some minor de-regularization across days. The net wearable sleep/circadian picture does not show a strong deterioration and is compatible with the reported subjective improvements (e.g., stable-to-increased perceived weekday sleep and reduced anxiety), though the small decrease in amplitude and slight increase in sleep-duration variability warrant attention as subtle, potentially compensatory changes.

Cardiovascular physiology shows small upward shifts in tonic indices. Resting heart rate rose modestly (65.2 → 66.5 bpm) and aggregated hourly heart-rate values show higher peaks during several daytime hours compared to the prior period. These changes are small in magnitude and have minimal reported correlation with CES-D change in this dataset, but they may indicate mildly increased daytime autonomic activation despite improved self-reported affect. Given the weak correlations reported between these wearable cardiovascular deltas and CES-D change, these physiological shifts are secondary to the stronger psychological and behavioral signals.

Evidence for worsening CES-D (increase):
- A few wearable circadian features moved in directions sometimes associated with greater depressive burden (slightly lower amplitude and slightly lower interdaily stability), and sleep-duration variability increased; these could, in isolation, be interpreted as risk signals for worse mood. Resting heart rate rose slightly and several daytime hourly heart-rate values increased, which—if part of a sustained trend—could reflect increased physiological arousal. However, the magnitudes are small and correlations with CES-D change are weak.

Evidence for improvement or stability in CES-D (decrease/stable):
- Large decreases in trait anxiety (STAI dropped by 20 points, strongly correlated with CES-D change), increased self-esteem, decreased perceived stress, and a shift to reporting greater happiness are all robust, consistent indicators of decreased depressive symptom burden. Behavioral markers—more exercise with others, consistent socializing, stable or improved self-reported sleep duration—support improved or stable functioning. The initial CES-D score was high (37/60; Z = 2.47) and its negative correlation with change (−0.5) in the provided data suggests higher baseline scores were associated with greater reductions over time, consistent with the other improvements observed.

Holistic conclusion regarding CES-D direction:
Weighing the evidential pattern, the strongest and most directly relevant signals (large drop in STAI, increased self-esteem, decreased stress, improved self-reported happiness) point toward a decrease in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Wearable-derived circadian and physiological metrics contain a few small, potentially concerning shifts (reduced amplitude, slightly more variable sleep duration, small resting HR increase), but these are minor in magnitude and weakly associated with CES-D change in the provided correlations. Overall, the multimodal evidence indicates an improvement (decrease or stability) rather than a worsening in depressive symptoms.

94641,-18.0,"Multimodal summary and interpretation — overall context
The participant began the interval with an elevated CES‑D score (29/60; Z = 1.63), which is provided as an anchor for interpreting subsequent change. The initial-score correlation with subsequent change is moderately negative (–0.50), indicating that higher initial scores in the sample tended to be followed by reductions (regression toward lower scores), a useful statistical context but not diagnostic on its own. Across self-report, sleep, and wearable physiological signals, the most consistent and largest-magnitude changes are reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress, increased sleep duration and sleep regularity, modest increases in self‑esteem and health satisfaction, and a lowering of resting heart rate. These patterns, taken together with the sign and magnitude of the reported delta–CES‑D correlations for key measures, point toward an overall reduction in depressive symptom burden rather than systematic worsening.

Self-report psychological and behavioral measures
Trait anxiety (STAI‑Trait) shows a large, clinically meaningful decline from 54 to 37 (score delta = –17; Z‑score of delta ≈ –1.94). The delta correlation for STAI with CES‑D change is strongly positive (0.72), meaning that a reduction in STAI in this sample is typically associated with a reduction in CES‑D; given the participant’s large STAI decrease, this is a strong indicator consistent with improvement in depressive symptoms. Perceived stress also decreased substantially (23 → 16; delta = –7), and although the stress–CES‑D delta correlation is modest (0.25), the direction is consistent with symptom improvement. Self‑esteem increased slightly (32 → 34; delta +2) and has a moderate negative delta–CES‑D correlation (–0.48), so this upward shift further supports decreases in depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction rose meaningfully and socializing increased (from ~15 minutes to 1–2 hours), both changes that are typically associated with lower depressive burden in population data (their delta correlations are small but in the expected direction). Conversely, reported trust dropped and BMI increased (23.12 → 25.56), which are potential negative signals; however, these changes are smaller in magnitude or have weaker links to CES‑D change in the provided correlations and are outweighed by the larger improvements in anxiety, stress, and social engagement.

Sleep and circadian physiology
Objective sleep behavior from the wearable shows a marked increase in median nightly sleep duration (from ~6 h 15 m to ~8 h 32 m; +2 h 16 m; Z‑score of delta ~+2.54) and reduced night‑to‑night variability (sleep‑start SD decreased, and overall sleep duration SD declined). These changes reflect more total sleep and more consistent timing. The sleep–CES‑D delta correlations provided are small and mixed (e.g., increased sleep duration has a small positive correlation with CES‑D change, 0.15), so the direct statistical linkage is weak; nevertheless, greater total sleep and improved regularity commonly accompany symptomatic improvement and are physiologically supportive. The median sleep start shifted later by ~1 hour 8 minutes; the delta–CES‑D correlation for later sleep start is moderately negative (–0.39), indicating that, in this dataset, later sleep onset changes were associated with reductions in CES‑D—consistent with the participant’s other improvements. One subjective sleep measure (self‑reported sleep latency) is notably elevated now (120 minutes), which is a concerning subjective symptom that could counteract other sleep improvements; its correlation with CES‑D change is negligible in the supplied data (0.05), so its predictive value here is limited but worth monitoring clinically.

Autonomic/circadian indicators
Resting heart rate decreased by ~4.2 bpm (from 67.8 to 63.6), a moderate physiological improvement consistent with reduced tonic arousal or improved cardiovascular fitness; the delta correlation with CES‑D change is essentially null (0.01) but the magnitude of change supports a reduction in physiological stress. Cosinor and non‑parametric circadian measures are largely stable or show small shifts: mesor and interdaily stability are similar across waves, amplitude increased slightly, intraday variability is unchanged, and the acrophase shifted later in the day (~4:05 PM → ~6:50 PM). The later acrophase and modestly greater amplitude could reflect a relative consolidation of activity in the evening; the circadian stability metrics’ deltas are small and have weak correlations to CES‑D change in the dataset, so they do not strongly contradict the pattern of clinical improvement.

Conflicting or cautionary signals
A few indicators are inconsistent with a straightforward improvement narrative. Reported trust declined and the simple happiness label shifted in a direction that may indicate slightly less positive affect; BMI increased notably (≈+2.4), which can have downstream effects on mood and health. The participant also reports a very long subjective sleep latency (120 minutes) despite objective increases in total sleep duration; this divergence between subjective and objective sleep measures can reflect residual insomnia complaints or sleep quality issues even when total sleep increases. Several of these signals have small delta–CES‑D correlations in the provided data, suggesting limited predictive weight relative to the larger psychological improvements, but they represent risk or complexity that should be tracked.

Evidence for worsening versus improvement
Evidence supporting a decrease in depressive symptom burden: large reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress (both of which have delta correlations indicating their reductions correspond to CES‑D decreases), increases in self‑esteem and health satisfaction (both correlated with CES‑D improvement), substantially greater and more regular objective sleep, increased social engagement, and a meaningful drop in resting heart rate. The magnitudes of change in STAI and sleep duration are especially notable and align with reductions in CES‑D in the sample correlations provided.

Evidence supporting a possible increase or stability (worsening): decreased interpersonal trust, increased BMI, elevated subjective sleep latency, and a few small correlations in which increases (or decreases) in a metric are associated with CES‑D increases. These signals are smaller in magnitude or have weaker predictive correlations compared with the stronger signals indicating improvement.

Holistic conclusion
Weighing the direction, magnitude, and the CES‑D–delta correlations provided, the preponderance of high‑magnitude and high‑relevance changes (large decrease in trait anxiety, reduced stress, more sleep and greater sleep regularity, increased social engagement, and lower resting heart rate) point toward a net reduction in depressive symptom burden since the prior wave. Some contradictory signals exist and suggest the need for continued monitoring (notably subjective sleep latency, reduced trust, and weight gain), but they do not outweigh the stronger, converging indicators of improvement.

45076,-9.0,"Multimodal self-report profile — trait and affective measures:
Compared with the prior wave the participant reports a mixed pattern of change across trait and affect measures. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased from 44 to 40, a modest reduction in chronic anxiety proneness; the STAI delta shows a relatively strong positive correlation with CES-D change in the study (delta correlation = 0.72), indicating that reductions in trait anxiety in this sample have tended to co-occur with reductions in depressive symptoms. Perceived stress shows a substantial decline (29 → 20), also consistent with lower acute stress burden. In contrast, self‑esteem shows a marked decline (score drop of 8 points, large relative Z-change), a change that in the sample correlates moderately negatively with CES‑D change (delta correlation = −0.49), meaning drops in self‑esteem have tended to be associated with increases in depressive symptoms. Subjective momentary affect shifted from “pretty happy” to “Happy.” Taken together, self-report affect and stress variables largely point toward improvement or relief (lower anxiety and stress, happier momentary affect) but the large decrease in self‑esteem is a countervailing signal that has been associated in this dataset with worsening CES‑D.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology (wearable data):
Wearable-recorded sleep and circadian metrics show clear deterioration relative to the prior recording period. Median nightly sleep duration decreased by about 1 hour 14 minutes (from ~7h38m to ~6h52m), sleep start time shifted later by ~1.5 hours (median start 00:57 → 02:27) and night-to-night variability in sleep timing increased. Circadian summary features derived from heart rate indicate reduced interdaily stability (less regular day-to-day rhythm), increased intradaily variability (more fragmentation), lower amplitude, and a modestly higher mesor/resting heart rate. Aggregated hourly heart‑rate profiles show elevated values at multiple nocturnal and evening hours compared with the prior period, consistent with both delayed sleep timing and higher physiological activation during typical sleep hours. These objective changes (shorter, later, more irregular sleep; dampened circadian amplitude; higher nocturnal heart rate) are commonly linked with increased depressive symptomatology and poorer mood regulation in the literature and represent salient physiological signals of increased risk.

Behavioral routines and activity patterns:
Leisure and daily activity patterns shifted toward greater sedentary and screen-based time. The participant reports large increases in time spent watching TV/videos/movies, internet use and in “sedentary hobby” time; these changes are large relative to the cohort (high Z-change values). Frequency of exercise and social exercise remained stable at a relatively high level (three times per week or more). Socializing time self-reportedly increased to more than four hours, which could reflect either greater in‑person interaction or more time spent on social media/online interactions given simultaneous large increases in internet and screen use. BMI increased slightly and subjective health satisfaction dipped modestly. Overall, behavioral changes include greater passive screen time and irregular daily structure, which, combined with the objective circadian disruption, point toward behavioral patterns that frequently co-occur with worsening mood.

Weighing signals for change in depressive burden:
Evidence favoring improvement/stability: reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress and a self-report shift to being “Happy” are direct affective signals that have correlated with decreased CES‑D in this sample (STAI delta correlation positive, stress delta correlation weakly positive). Evidence favoring worsening: a large decline in self‑esteem (a variable whose change correlates with increases in CES‑D), pronounced objective sleep loss and delay (over an hour less sleep, substantially later and more variable bedtimes), marked circadian rhythm destabilization (lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability, reduced amplitude), and elevated nocturnal/evening heart rates. The objective physiological and sleep/circadian signals are substantial in magnitude (large Z‑changes for sleep timing and circadian fragmentation) and align conceptually and empirically with increased depressive symptom burden. While some self‑report affect measures improved, the combination of a large self‑esteem decline plus objective sleep/circadian deterioration and increased passive sedentary behavior are stronger and more consistent indicators of a net increase in depressive burden in this participant relative to the prior wave.

Overall assessment:
Balancing the multimodal evidence, the most salient and likely-driving changes are (1) a large drop in self‑esteem, (2) objectively reduced and delayed sleep with greater timing variability, and (3) measurable circadian disruption and higher nocturnal heart rates. These physiological and self‑concept changes typically relate to worsening depressive symptoms and — in aggregate — outweigh the improvements signaled by reduced anxiety and perceived stress in this participant. The integrated evidence therefore indicates an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the previous data collection.

27306,-4.0,"Paragraph 1 — Psychometric and self-report changes:
Between the two waves the participant’s self-report profile shows a mixed but generally positive pattern with respect to affective indicators. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased substantially (37 → 30), a large within-person change that is strongly associated with concurrent CES-D change in the study sample (delta correlation = 0.72); this pattern strongly favors a reduction in depressive symptom burden. Subjective happiness also increased (from “pretty happy” to “very happy”), which in the sample is associated with reductions in CES-D (delta correlation = -0.26). Self-esteem is essentially stable with a minimal decline (50 → 49) and a moderate negative correlation with CES-D change (−0.48), so this small decrease would, if anything, be a modest push toward greater depressive symptoms but of very small magnitude. Perceived stress increased by 3 points (21 → 24); given the small positive correlation of stress-change with CES-D change (0.26), this change would modestly oppose improvement. Taken together, the largest and most tightly associated psychometric change is the marked decrease in trait anxiety accompanied by increased self-reported happiness, which outweighs the smaller opposing signal from increased perceived stress.

Paragraph 2 — Sleep behavior and subjective sleep experience:
Objective sleep timing and regularity changed in several ways. Median nightly sleep duration from the wearable decreased slightly (6 h 42 m → 6 h 25 m) while night-to-night variability declined (SD 84 m → 56 m), indicating somewhat shorter but more consistent sleep. Median sleep start time shifted later by about 39 minutes. On the self-report side, normal weekday sleep duration increased slightly (6.0 → 6.5 hours) and perceived control over sleep improved marginally. Correlations between these sleep changes and CES-D change are small or near zero in the sample, so the net contribution of sleep to depressive symptom change is ambiguous: greater regularity and perceived control are protective signals, whereas a modest reduction in objectively measured duration and a later sleep timing could be neutral or slightly unfavorable. Overall sleep-related signals do not indicate a large change in depressive burden.

Paragraph 3 — Wearable physiology and circadian-derived metrics:
Cardiovascular signals show notable change: resting heart rate declined substantially (45.1 → 39.7 bpm), reflected in a lower MESOR, while amplitude remained essentially unchanged. Interdaily stability and intradaily variability show minimal change. The acrophase shifted earlier (previously ~2:13 PM to ~12:41 PM), and aggregated hourly heart-rate patterns suggest redistribution of cardiovascular load across the day (notably reduced afternoon peaks compared with the prior wave). Changes in resting heart rate and MESOR have negligible correlations with CES-D change in the sample (correlations near zero), so while these physiological shifts may reflect fitness, activity, or schedule changes, they do not strongly indicate directional change in depressive symptoms by themselves.

Paragraph 4 — Activity, social behavior, and health perceptions:
Behavioral routines changed modestly: frequency of exercising alone remained high (≥3×/week) but exercising with others decreased (from 3×/week to 1–2×/week), and time spent socializing declined (about 31–60 minutes → 16–30 minutes). Substance use and recreational activities remained minimal and stable. Self-rated health satisfaction declined (6.67 → 5.78), a nontrivial decrease that has a small negative association with CES-D change. The reduction in social/communal activity is a potential risk factor for increased symptoms, but its delta correlations with CES-D change are small. Trust in others increased slightly. Overall these behavioral shifts are mixed: improved solitary exercise and higher trust potentially protective, reduced social engagement and lower health satisfaction potentially adverse.

Paragraph 5 — Synthesis and weight-of-evidence judgment:
Balancing all modalities, the most substantial and study-relevant signals point toward an overall reduction or stabilization of depressive symptom burden rather than a worsening. The single largest and most CES-D–predictive change is the pronounced drop in trait anxiety coupled with increased subjective happiness; both of these are strongly associated with reductions in CES-D in the sample. Physiological data show notable changes (lower resting heart rate, shifts in daily HR peaks) but have negligible direct association with CES-D change. Countervailing signals—moderate increases in perceived stress, decreased socializing and exercise-with-others, and lower health satisfaction—are present but smaller in magnitude or less tightly correlated with CES-D change than the anxiety/happiness signals. The participant’s initial CES-D score was very low (6/60), and available multimodal evidence overall supports stable-to-decreasing depressive symptoms rather than an increase.

46365,14.0,"Multimodal psychological and behavioral synthesis — self-report traits and lifestyle:
Between waves the participant shows several self-report shifts consistent with greater internalizing symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI increased from 45 to 48 (Δ = +3; Z-Score change ≈ +0.63) and this change has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change (Δ correlation = 0.72), indicating that rising trait anxiety is likely aligned with increases in depressive symptoms. Self-esteem decreased modestly (RSES 40 → 38, Δ = -2), a direction that is typically associated with greater depressive symptomatology (Δ correlation = -0.48). Perceived stress also rose (20 → 24; Δ = +4; Z-Score of Δ = +1.33), which is a robust proximal risk factor for increases in depressive symptoms. At the same time, some positive subjective signals are present: self-rated health satisfaction increased markedly (2.33 → 4.44; Δ = +2.11), and the participant reports being “pretty happy” at both time points (no substantive change reported). These mixed subjective signals suggest co-occurring increases in stress and anxiety with improved global health satisfaction.

Behavioral changes relevant to social support, substance use, and activity:
Social behavior and substance-use patterns changed in ways that can contribute to risk. The participant’s reported socializing time decreased substantially (previously “more than 4 hours” → currently “31 minutes an hour” as coded), while alcohol and recreational drug use increased (wine/liquor moved from rare to weekly use; recreational and non-prescribed drug use moved from none to occasional). Exercise behavior shifted toward more solitary exercise (exercising alone increased to “three times a week or more”), while organized sports participation decreased. Reduced social contact combined with increased substance use and greater solitary exercise is a behavioral pattern that commonly co-occurs with worsening mood symptoms and reduced social buffering; several of these deltas have small-to-moderate correlations with CES-D change in the dataset (though not all correlations are large).

Wearable-derived sleep and sleep regularity:
Objective sleep duration improved slightly and became more regular: median nightly sleep increased by ~17 minutes (7:16 → 7:34) and night-to-night standard deviation of sleep duration decreased (91 min → 70 min). Sleep latency improved (self-reported 15 → 10 minutes). Median sleep start time shifted earlier (current median 01:15 vs previous 01:34) while variability in sleep onset increased (sleep start SD increased by ~22 minutes). These changes (slightly longer sleep, shorter latency, reduced duration variability) are generally protective or neutral for mood, though the increase in variability of sleep-onset timing may indicate some instability in sleep timing despite improved mean duration.

Circadian structure and heart-rate dynamics:
Aggregate circadian metrics from the wearable indicate a weakening of circadian regularity. Interdaily stability fell substantially (0.49 → 0.29; Δ = -0.20; Z-Score change ≈ -1.44), autocorrelation at 24 hours declined (0.17 → 0.10), and cosinor-derived amplitude decreased (12.44 → 10.24). These changes together indicate a blunting and destabilization of day-to-day heart-rate rhythmicity. Resting heart rate declined (56.5 → 50.6 bpm), which may reflect improved cardiovascular fitness or autonomic shifts, but the reduced amplitude and stability of the circadian signal are more commonly associated with greater depressive symptom burden or disrupted daily structure. Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show lower night-time values but several larger daytime peaks (particularly early afternoon increases), reflecting altered diurnal arousal patterns compared to the prior wave.

Integration and interpretation of mixed signals:
Overall the dataset contains a mix of protective and risk-relevant signals. Risk-oriented evidence includes increases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, a decline in self-esteem, reduced socializing, increased substance use, and marked decreases in circadian regularity and amplitude — factors that are each plausibly linked to increases in depressive symptoms in prior work. Conversely, there are protective or neutral signals: objectively a small increase in nightly sleep duration and reduced variability in sleep duration, improved sleep latency, reduced resting heart rate, increased solitary exercise frequency, and higher self-rated health satisfaction. However, several of the strongest, most directly depression-linked changes (notably the STAI increase with a high Δ correlation to CES-D change and the large drop in interdaily stability/amplitude of the circadian rhythm) point toward an overall increase in depressive symptom burden since the prior wave.

Evidence for worsening (increase) in CES-D:
- STAI–Trait increased (45 → 48) with a high change–CESD correlation (0.72), a strong indicator that depressive symptoms moved upward.
- Perceived stress rose (20 → 24), and stress increases commonly accompany CES-D increases.
- Self-esteem declined (40 → 38), which is associated with greater depressive symptoms (Δ correlation -0.48).
- Increase in substance use (wine/liquor, recreational drugs) and reduced socializing are behavioral changes that typically relate to increased depressive burden.
- Wearable circadian metrics show marked destabilization (interdaily stability and amplitude decreased), a physiological pattern frequently linked to greater mood symptoms.

Evidence for improvement or stability in CES-D:
- Small objective improvements in sleep (median duration +17 minutes, latency shorter) and reduced variability of sleep duration could support stable or improved mood.
- Resting heart rate decreased (which may reflect better fitness), and exercise frequency (alone) increased; both can be protective against depressive symptoms.
- Self-rated health satisfaction increased substantially, which could reflect improved perceived wellbeing.

Holistic conclusion regarding direction of change:
Weighing the evidence, the net pattern favors a modest worsening of depressive symptom burden. The strongest and most depression-relevant signals (increases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, decline in self-esteem, increases in substance use and social withdrawal, and a pronounced reduction in circadian stability and amplitude) outweigh the smaller protective changes in sleep duration, resting heart rate, and self-rated health satisfaction. The high correlation of STAI change with CES-D change in this dataset further supports interpreting the rise in trait anxiety as a likely driver of increased CES-D. Therefore the overall balance of multimodal evidence indicates an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

72806,-4.0,"Multimodal self-report indicators show a net shift toward improved affective and psychosocial functioning relative to the prior wave. Trait anxiety on the STAI–Trait fell substantially (33 → 26; Z-score change ≈ -0.66) and the magnitude of that STAI decrease is strongly correlated with CES-D change in the dataset (delta correlation = 0.72), which supports interpretation that reductions in anxiety-like symptoms co-occurred with reductions in depressive symptoms. Concurrently, the participant reports increased happiness (from ""pretty happy"" to ""very happy""), a small increase in self-esteem (RSES 39 → 40), a modest decrease in perceived stress (21 → 18), and small rises in trust and health satisfaction. Behavioral social markers moved in a positive direction: frequency of solo exercise increased (to three times per week or more) and time spent socializing increased (from about 31 minutes to 1–2 hours). These subjective and behavioral changes—larger decreases in anxiety and stress together with more exercise and social time—are consistent with a reduction in depressive burden rather than worsening.

Objective wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics largely align with improved autonomic/fitness markers while showing some changes in rhythm regularity. Resting heart rate declined from 56.0 to 52.1 bpm (Δ = -3.9 bpm, Z-Score of Δ ≈ -0.78), and the MESOR (mean of the circadian heart rate rhythm) decreased similarly, suggesting lower average cardiovascular activation and/or improved cardiovascular fitness. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased and intradaily variability decreased slightly, indicating a modest strengthening of 24-hour structure despite a small drop in interdaily stability; amplitude remained essentially unchanged and the acrophase shifted earlier by roughly 45 minutes. Hourly aggregated heart rate values show lower values across many hours compared with the prior wave, supporting the resting-heart-rate-based inference. These physiological shifts—particularly lower resting HR—are more compatible with reduced physiological stress or improved fitness than with increased depressive burden.

Sleep-related signals are mixed: subjective sleep perceptions improved modestly while objective timing variability increased. The participant reports feeling more in control of sleep duration and indicates an ideal weekday sleep time increased to 9 hours, but normal weekday self-reported sleep duration decreased (7 → 6 hours). Wearable sleep metrics indicate a small reduction in median sleep duration and a clear increase in variability: sleep duration standard deviation rose and sleep start time standard deviation increased substantially (from ~68 to ~115 minutes). Median sleep start time shifted later by about ten minutes. Increased day-to-day variability in sleep timing can be associated with worse mood regulation, but in this case the detrimental sleep variability co-occurs with large improvements in trait anxiety, self-reported happiness, increased exercise and socializing, and lower resting heart rate; thus the net pattern is not dominated by sleep worsening alone.

Integrative appraisal: the preponderance of evidence across self-report, behavioral, and physiological domains points toward reduced depressive symptom burden relative to the prior assessment. Large decreases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, increased positive affect and social engagement, small gains in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and objective reductions in resting heart rate and mean circadian heart rate collectively favor an improvement. Mixed signals from sleep variability and slightly reduced median sleep duration temper the magnitude of improvement but do not outweigh the convergent indicators of better mood and lower physiological activation. On balance, the data support that the participant’s CES-D score is stable or decreased (an improvement) rather than increased.

67918,-3.0,"Multimodal summary and high-level interpretation
The participant’s baseline CES-D score is very low (5/60; Z = -0.86), indicating minimal depressive symptom burden at the initial assessment. No second CES-D total score is provided, so inferences about change must be drawn from concurrent self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological signals. Several self-report indices moved in a direction typically associated with reduced affective distress: trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) fell by 8 points (35 → 27; Z‑delta ≈ -0.78) and perceived stress declined by 6 points (21 → 15; Z‑delta ≈ -0.83). The participant’s global description of affect remains “pretty happy” (unchanged). These large reductions in anxiety and stress are the most prominent self-report improvements and, given their magnitudes and the positive correlation reported between STAI change and CES-D change (delta correlation ≈ 0.72), provide relatively strong evidence consistent with stable or decreased depressive symptom burden.

Self-report risk signals and lifestyle changes
Mixed signals appear in other self-report domains. Self‑esteem shows a marked decrease (score delta -8; Z‑score of delta ≈ -1.46), which is commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms; the reported correlation for self‑esteem change with CES‑D change (-0.48) indicates this decrease in self‑esteem would tend to predict worsening mood. Health satisfaction also declined modestly (≈ -1 on a 1–7 scale). Substance use increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month” for beer and wine, while exercise with others fell to “not at all”; these behavioral changes could modestly increase psychosocial risk but are small in frequency. Recreational activities such as reading and listening to music increased and daily socializing remained stable; these changes could be neutral-to-protective for mood.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology
Objective sleep duration shortened by approximately one hour (median sleep 8 h 42 m → 7 h 46 m; Z‑delta ≈ -1.25), and median sleep onset shifted later by ~54 minutes. At the same time, night-to-night variability in sleep duration fell (SD 74 → 53 minutes), suggesting more consistent sleep duration despite the shorter average. Shorter sleep and later sleep onset are risk factors for worsening mood and are notable here; their delta correlations with CES‑D change are small but the magnitude of the change in duration is substantial relative to prior recording. Circadian measures derived from heart rate show a modest loss of amplitude (15.31 → 13.52) and a small increase in intradaily variability (0.39 → 0.46), while interdaily stability remains high (0.67 → 0.66). These patterns (lower amplitude, slightly more within-day fragmentation) are consistent with a modest reduction in circadian robustness, which in other datasets tends to align with increased depressive symptoms.

Cardiovascular arousal and daily heart rate patterning
Resting heart rate increased by ~2.9 bpm (64.6 → 67.5; Z‑delta ≈ 0.66). Aggregated hourly heart rate profiles show higher daytime and afternoon heart rates relative to prior data, while nighttime hourly values are mixed. An elevated resting heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude (MESOR slightly higher, amplitude lower) point toward increased physiological arousal or autonomic activation relative to the prior wave. These physiological shifts are modest in magnitude but coherent (higher baseline HR, reduced rhythm amplitude), and in the literature they are more often associated with greater physiological stress or poorer mood regulation than with improvement.

Weighing convergent evidence across modalities
The dataset presents a mixture of changes: large self‑report reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress (both strongly suggestive of stable or improved depressive burden), but concurrent declines in self‑esteem, shorter and later sleep, increased resting heart rate, reduced circadian amplitude, and a small rise in substance use (each of which would conventionally point toward greater risk for depressive symptoms). Several protective signs—stable subjective happiness rating, increased engagement with reading/music, and greater night-to-night sleep consistency—offset some physiological and self‑esteem declines. Because the largest-magnitude and most robustly correlated changes are the reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress (both of which have been shown here to correlate positively with CES‑D change), and because the participant’s baseline depressive burden was very low, the preponderance of evidence supports that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not increased and is more consistent with stability or modest improvement rather than worsening. In sum, psychological self-report points toward decreased anxiety/stress (strong evidence for improvement), while objective sleep and physiological measures show small adverse shifts; integrating these signals yields a conclusion of overall stability or modest decrease in depressive burden rather than an increase.

34467,-2.0,"Summary and context: The participant’s baseline CES-D score is low (7/60; Z = -0.66), indicating low depressive symptom burden at the initial assessment. Across the two measurement waves the data show a pattern of small, mixed self-report changes (slight increases in stress and state anxiety, stable self-esteem and reported happiness, increased trust and health satisfaction) accompanied by clearer, favorable changes in wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology (reduced sleep timing variability, increased circadian amplitude, lower resting heart rate). Taken together these multimodal signals point to relative stability at a low level of depressive symptoms with some objective improvements in physiological regulation.

Self-report psychological and behavioral measures: Trait anxiety on the STAI increased by 1 point (33 → 34), but remains in the study-typical “not anxious” range and the observed change is small (STAI delta Z ≈ 0.37). Perceived stress rose by 1 point (22 → 23; Z moved from 0.10 to 0.82), a modest increase but still not extreme. Self-esteem (Rosenberg) is unchanged at a relatively high value (40), and happiness is reported as “very happy” at both time points. Trust and satisfaction with physical health both increased (trust Δ = +0.67, health satisfaction Δ = +0.44), which are socially and functionally positive changes. Daily activities (exercise frequency, substance use, most leisure behaviors) are largely unchanged; socializing and internet-use show small decreases in time reported, while reading increased slightly.

Sleep: subjective and objective indicators diverge somewhat. Self-reported “normal weekday sleep” decreased from 6.0 to 5.5 hours (a negative self-report change), and the participant still disagrees that they are in control of sleep duration. By contrast Fitbit-derived sleep shows a stable median sleep duration (~7h22m current vs ~7h24m previous) and, importantly, a pronounced decrease in night-to-night variability: sleep duration SD fell from 128 minutes to 69 minutes and sleep start-time SD fell markedly (from ~134 minutes to 46 minutes). Median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 13 minutes (23:34 → 23:21) with reduced variability. The objective pattern is one of more consistent sleep timing and less sleep variability—features generally associated with better circadian stability—even if subjective perception of weekday sleep hours declined.

Circadian rhythm and cardiac physiology: wearable-derived circadian metrics show clearer improvement in regularity and rhythm strength. Interdaily stability increased (0.38 → 0.46), intradaily variability decreased (0.78 → 0.63), and amplitude rose substantially (7.15 → 12.81; large positive Δ and Z-Score of the delta ≈ 1.9). Acrophase shifted earlier (previously 2:47 PM, now 1:09 PM), indicating an earlier peak in heart-rate rhythm. Resting heart rate fell by ~4.5 bpm (46.6 → 42.1; current RHR Z ≈ -2.05), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows lower overnight and early-morning heart rates relative to the prior wave. These changes—greater amplitude, reduced intradaily variability, greater interdaily stability, and lower RHR—collectively indicate improved circadian consolidation and a lower tonic cardiovascular arousal level across the recording period.

Evidence consistent with worsening CES-D (increase): Small increases in self-reported stress (Δ +1) and trait-anxiety (Δ +1; STAI delta correlates positively with CES-D change in this sample, r ≈ 0.72) could point toward modest upward pressure on depressive symptoms. The participant’s subjective report of shorter typical weekday sleep (5.5 h vs 6.0 h previously) and lack of perceived control over sleep could also contribute to worsened mood or fatigue. Socializing time is slightly reduced, which in some contexts aligns with increased risk for worsening mood.

Evidence consistent with stability or improvement in CES-D (decrease/stable): Objective sleep and circadian measures show consistent improvement: large reductions in sleep-timing and duration variability, increased circadian amplitude, greater interdaily stability, and a notable reduction in resting heart rate. Self-esteem is unchanged at a high level, happiness self-report remains “very happy,” trust and health-satisfaction increased—changes that are protective or indicative of wellbeing. Overall activity patterns (exercise frequency) are stable. Many of these physiological and psychosocial changes correlate weakly or in directions associated with reduced depressive symptom burden (e.g., stronger circadian amplitude and lower RHR are typically associated with better mood regulation).

Holistic assessment and conclusion: The preponderance of objective physiological and circadian evidence indicates improved regularity and lower physiological arousal, and self-report indicators of wellbeing (self-esteem, happiness, trust, health satisfaction) are stable or improved. In contrast, the self-reported increases in stress and trait-anxiety are small in magnitude and the one subjective decline in weekday sleep duration is discordant with wearable-recorded sleep stability. Given the participant’s very low initial CES-D and the stronger, consistent improvements in circadian and cardiac metrics together with largely stable positive self-report outcomes, the overall pattern is more compatible with stability or modest improvement in depressive burden rather than a meaningful worsening. Therefore the net assessment is that CES-D burden has not increased.

59673,-5.0,"Multimodal summary and context
The participant’s baseline CES-D score was low (7/60, Z = -0.66), indicating limited depressive symptom burden at the initial assessment. Several concurrent self-report and wearable-derived metrics changed between waves, producing a mixed pattern of signals. Below I summarize the most salient changes in self-report, behavioral, sleep, and physiological rhythm data and integrate their likely relevance to depressive symptom change.

Self-report psychological and behavioral changes
Trait and symptom-report measures trending in a positive direction include a large reduction in trait anxiety (STAI: 37 → 25, Δ = -12; Z-score change large and negative) and a modest reduction in perceived stress (22 → 19). Trust and health satisfaction showed clear increases. Social behavior items also suggest more social time (socializing increased to ~1–2 hours from ~30 minutes), and self-reported control over sleep improved (from “Disagree” to “Somewhat Agree”). Against these improvements, self-esteem declined modestly (50 → 45) and the participant’s self-label of happiness changed from “happy” to “pretty happy,” indicating a small drop in subjective positive affect. Notably, substance use increased: beer consumption rose markedly (from monthly to ~3×/week) and recreational drug use was reported where previously it was not. Increased alcohol and novel recreational drug use represent behavioral risk factors that may counterbalance other psychosocial gains.

Sleep patterns and variability (self-report + wearable)
Objective median sleep duration was largely stable and near normative for young adults (about 7h 28m, small decrease from prior), and self-reported typical weekday sleep remained at 7 hours. However, measures of sleep timing regularity worsened: the standard deviation of sleep start time increased substantially (98 → 172 minutes), indicating much greater night-to-night variability in sleep onset. Sleep duration variability increased modestly. The participant reports greater perceived control over sleep amount despite greater objective variability in sleep timing. Increased timing irregularity and fragmentation are commonly associated with worse mood outcomes, even when average duration is unchanged.

Circadian and cardiac physiology
Aggregate circadian rhythm metrics indicate a net strengthening of daily structure: interdaily stability increased (0.43 → 0.58) and amplitude rose (11.5 → 13.6), consistent with a more pronounced daily rhythm of heart rate across days. At the same time, intradaily variability also increased (0.47 → 0.64), suggesting more fragmentation of activity or physiological state within days. Resting heart rate decreased slightly (58.5 → 57 bpm). Hourly aggregated heart rate profiles show higher evening and late-evening peaks in the current wave (e.g., a large increase around 8–9 pm relative to the prior assessment), which could reflect later or more intense evening activity/arousal. Overall, stronger interdaily stability and higher amplitude typically reflect better circadian organization (a positive sign), whereas increased intradaily fragmentation and elevated evening arousal may reflect stressors or behavioral patterns (e.g., late-night activity, alcohol intake) that could be detrimental to mood.

Integration and likely implications for CES-D change
Several high-weight indicators point toward improvement or stability in depressive burden. The pronounced decrease in trait anxiety (a strong correlate of depressive symptoms) and the modest reduction in perceived stress are robust signals favoring reduced depressive symptoms; the delta correlation for STAI change with CES-D change is large (0.72), strengthening the inference that decreased anxiety likely accompanies decreased depressive symptoms. In addition, increases in trust, health satisfaction, socializing, and interdaily circadian stability/adaptive amplitude are consistent with improved or stable mood. Offsetting these are increases in substance use (alcohol and recreational drugs), greater night-to-night sleep timing variability, increased intradaily variability, higher evening physiological arousal, and a small decline in self-esteem and subjective happiness. Those latter elements are risk signals that could precipitate or maintain depressive symptoms if they escalate.

Overall directional judgment
Balancing the magnitude and clinical relevance of changes, the most substantial and directly mood-relevant change is the large drop in trait anxiety coupled with reductions in perceived stress and gains in social engagement and trust. Although there are notable risk factors (marked increase in alcohol use, new recreational drug use, greater sleep-timing variability, and increased evening physiological arousal), these appear to be partial countervailing influences rather than dominant shifts. Given the participant’s low initial CES-D score and the strong, positive changes in anxiety and stress-related measures (which correlate strongly with CES-D change), the overall pattern is more consistent with stable or modestly decreased depressive symptom burden rather than a clear increase.

Conclusion (direction of CES-D change)
On balance, the multimodal evidence supports a conclusion that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not wors and is more consistent with stability or modest improvement.

17308,-8.0,"Self-report measures indicate meaningful improvements in psychological distress between waves. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased by 6 points (43 → 37), moving the participant from a classification of ""anxious"" to ""not anxious""; the magnitude of this change is substantial in the available context and the STAI delta has a strong positive correlation (0.72) with CES-D change, suggesting that reductions in anxiety are likely to coincide with reductions in depressive symptoms. Perceived stress also fell by 6 points (25 → 19) with a moderate but smaller correlation with CES-D change (0.25). Self-esteem remained stable (37 unchanged), and self-reported happiness remained nominally positive. Behavioral self-reports show increased socializing (shift from 16–30 minutes to 31 minutes an hour) and stable or increased exercise frequency, both of which conventionally support mood maintenance or improvement. Health satisfaction declined modestly and BMI increased slightly; these are small-to-moderate adverse changes but are not large enough in magnitude relative to the psychological improvements to dominate the profile.

Sleep-related data present a mixed but overall slightly positive picture from subjective and wearable perspectives. Subjective normal weekday sleep duration and sleep latency are unchanged and within normative ranges (7 hours, 10 minutes latency). Objective Fitbit sleep shows a small increase in median nightly sleep (an increase of ~14 minutes to 7 h 41 m), but also later sleep timing (median sleep start delayed by ~40 minutes) and greater night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD increased by ~27 minutes and start-time SD increased). The later sleep timing has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D change (−0.40), meaning the observed later bedtime in this sample is associated with reductions in CES-D in the cohort data; however, the increase in variability is typically considered less favorable for mood. Overall, sleep duration improved marginally while regularity worsened.

Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics show a notable reduction in the stability and amplitude of the participant’s circadian heart-rate rhythm. Interdaily stability decreased markedly (0.44 → 0.29) and autocorrelation at 24 hours fell (0.28 → 0.10), indicating less consistent day-to-day rhythmicity; amplitude dropped substantially (13.57 → 7.70), a large change consistent with a blunted circadian amplitude. Acrophase shifted later by approximately 1 hour 44 minutes (from ~4:02 PM to ~5:46 PM), indicating a phase delay. Intradaily variability decreased (0.64 → 0.47), which may reflect less within-day fragmentation, but the dominant pattern is reduced circadian regularity and amplitude. In many literatures, reduced circadian amplitude and lower interdaily stability are associated with greater depressive symptomatology; in this dataset the correlations between these circadian deltas and CES-D change are small, so their predictive weight is moderate but not definitive.

Physiological cardiovascular indicators show an upward shift in basal cardiac activity. Resting heart rate increased by +5 bpm (47.2 → 52.2) and the heart-rate mesor rose slightly, with aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles showing higher values across much of the night and early morning compared with the prior wave. These changes point to higher basal autonomic/physiological activation or a reduction in cardiovascular fitness relative to the earlier recording. The correlation of resting HR change with CES-D change is small in this dataset, so while the physiological pattern is concerning from a stress/health perspective, it provides only weak direct evidence about depressive symptom change.

Synthesizing across modalities: psychological self-reports (substantial decreases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, increased social activity, stable self-esteem) consistently point toward reduced depressive burden or stability at a low symptom level. Objective physiological and circadian markers (lower circadian amplitude and stability, later phase, and increased resting heart rate) provide countervailing signals that could reflect physiological dysregulation associated with risk for mood worsening. Sleep shows a small gain in total duration but worse timing regularity. Given the relative magnitudes and the stronger psychometric signal from self-report—particularly the large decrease in STAI, which correlates strongly with CES-D change—the balance of evidence favors an overall pattern of stable-to-improved depressive symptom burden since the prior wave, albeit with physiological markers that warrant monitoring.

77872,-2.0,"Multimodal summary and baseline anchoring:
The participant’s baseline CES-D score in the earlier wave was low (11/60; Z ≈ -0.24), indicating relatively few depressive symptoms at that anchor point. That initial score is negatively correlated with subsequent change in CES-D in the sample (r = -0.50), which suggests that individuals with lower baseline symptom burden in this cohort tended not to show large increases later. Because a later CES-D score is not provided here, interpretation must rely on convergent patterns across self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiology to infer likely direction of change in depressive burden.

Self-report psychological and behavioral indicators:
Several self-report psychological indicators point toward reduced affective burden relative to the prior wave. Perceived stress declined meaningfully (from 21 to 15; Δ = -6, Z-change ≈ -0.83), and trait anxiety (STAI) declined slightly (33 → 31). Self-esteem showed a small increase (44 → 45) and reported interpersonal trust increased modestly. The participant’s global happiness item is unchanged (“pretty happy”). Substance-use frequency for beer decreased (from weekly to monthly), and overall socializing time is steady; however, frequency of exercising with others dropped substantially (previously 1–2×/week to less than 1–2×/month), while exercising alone remained stable. These patterns suggest net improvement in self-reported stress and some affective domains, but a concurrent reduction in some social/physical activity contexts (group exercise) that can be mood-protective.

Wearable-derived physiology and activity rhythms:
Wearable metrics present a mixed pattern. Resting heart rate declined (≈58.6 → 55.3 bpm; Δ = -3.3), which can reflect reduced sympathetic tone or improved cardiovascular fitness and is consistent with lower physiological arousal. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show the expected nocturnal nadir and daytime elevations; relative to the new resting HR, daytime peaks are pronounced in the late-afternoon/early-evening (notably 5–6 pm), but overall daytime heart rate is modestly lower than in the prior wave for many hours. Circadian rhythm summary metrics show small decreases in mesor and amplitude and an earlier acrophase (≈5:49 pm → 5:20 pm). Non-parametric circadian indices indicate reduced interdaily stability (0.47 → 0.40) and increased intradaily variability (0.34 → 0.45), i.e., day-to-day schedule consistency declined and within-day fragmentation increased. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased, suggesting stronger 24-hour self-similarity despite the other signs of reduced regularity. Together, these results point to lower basal cardiovascular arousal but greater irregularity and fragmentation of daily activity rhythms.

Sleep quantity and regularity:
Both subjective and objective sleep indices reflect worsening in duration and stability. Self-reported normal weekday sleep decreased from ~6.5 hours to ~5.5 hours (Z-change ≈ -1.11). Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep decreased (previously ~6:50 → current ~6:29) and night-to-night variability increased (SD increased from ~64 to ~90 minutes). Median sleep start time moved earlier in the aggregated data but night-to-night start-time variability increased. The participant also reports feeling less in control of sleep duration. Reduced sleep duration and increased sleep timing variability are both commonly associated with worse mood and greater depressive symptoms; these changes therefore constitute risk factors that could contribute to increased depressive burden independent of improvements seen on some self-report affect measures.

Integrated interpretation weighing evidence:
Evidence is mixed but leans toward stable or reduced depressive burden rather than worsening. Direct affect-relevant self-reports show meaningful improvement (notably a sizable drop in perceived stress and modest decreases in trait anxiety together with a small rise in self-esteem and trust). Physiological arousal as indexed by resting heart rate has declined, consistent with lower tonic stress. In contrast, objective sleep loss and greater circadian irregularity and intraday fragmentation are risk factors for worsening mood and could exert negative influence over time; reductions in group-based exercise and health satisfaction are additional negative signals. On balance, the more proximal, affect-focused self-report changes (stress and anxiety reductions) and the lower resting heart rate—both fairly direct indicators of current affective state—carry substantial weight and suggest that overall depressive symptom burden has not increased. The concurrent deterioration in sleep and circadian regularity, however, represent vulnerabilities that may raise risk for future worsening if persistent.

Overall directional assessment:
Balancing the above, the preponderance of concurrent indicators—particularly the marked reduction in perceived stress, small improvement in trait anxiety and self-esteem, and lower resting heart rate—support a net stability or modest improvement in depressive symptoms compared with the prior wave, despite worrisome increases in sleep loss and circadian irregularity which warrant monitoring.

72348,7.0,"Multimodal self-report synthesis:
Over the two-year interval the participant shows a mixed pattern of psychological self-report change. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased from 39 to 43, moving the classification from “not anxious” to “anxious”; this change is relatively large in this dataset (Z-score change ~0.76) and the STAI delta has a strong positive correlation (0.72) with changes in CES‑D, indicating that increases in chronic anxiety are a prominent signal associated with worsening depressive symptoms in this sample. At the same time, self‑esteem increased by 3 points (34 → 37; Z‑score change ~0.58) and health satisfaction and interpersonal trust showed modest increases; the self‑esteem change is moderately negatively correlated with CES‑D change (−0.48), which would predict improvement. Perceived stress decreased slightly (22 → 21). Activity and social behavior shifted: exercise done alone increased (from monthly to weekly), while time spent socializing with friends decreased substantially (from ~1–2 hours to ~31 minutes per hour). Substance use remained absent. Overall, subjective psychological measures give mixed signals: a pronounced increase in trait anxiety and marked reduction in socializing are counterbalanced by improvements in self‑esteem, trust, and health satisfaction.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian rhythm:
Cardiovascular and circadian metrics indicate preserved circadian structure with some within‑day fragmentation. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation remain high (both Z-scores >1.7), suggesting a consistent day‑to‑day rhythm. Intradaily variability increased (0.50 → 0.61), indicating more frequent transitions in heart‑rate level within days (a small effect in this dataset), and the acrophase shifted later by ~52 minutes (from ~2:42 PM to ~3:34 PM). Mesor declined modestly and amplitude increased; resting heart rate decreased from 68.6 to 65.5 bpm (Z‑score change −0.61). Hourly aggregated heart‑rate profiles show generally lower daytime peaks compared with the prior period while nighttime values are similar. Taken together, the physiological profile suggests slightly greater within‑day variability and a later daily peak, but lower overall resting heart rate and preserved day‑to‑day rhythmicity—features that simultaneously could be interpreted as mild circadian shift/fragmentation and improved cardiorespiratory tone.

Sleep patterns:
Sleep quantity and timing are stable and adequate across waves. Median sleep duration is long and essentially unchanged (~8 h 23 m) with reduced night‑to‑night variability (SD of duration reduced from 39 to 34 minutes). Median sleep start time is stable at about 23:45, with small increases in start‑time variability (29 vs 26 minutes). Subjective normal weekday sleep duration reported via survey decreased slightly (7.5 → 7.0 hours), but self‑reported desired sleep remained 8 hours and perceived control over sleep was unchanged. Overall, objective sleep metrics indicate regular, sufficient sleep with slightly tighter duration consistency, which is typically a protective factor for mood.

Integration and interpretation regarding depressive burden:
Evidence pointing toward increased depressive symptom burden includes the pronounced increase in trait anxiety (STAI) — a measure that is strongly correlated with CES‑D change in this dataset — and the marked reduction in time spent socializing, which is behaviorally relevant for mood. Additional modest signals consistent with worsening include increased intradaily variability and a later acrophase, indicative of greater within‑day physiological fluctuation and a small circadian phase shift. Evidence supporting stable or improved depressive burden includes increased self‑esteem, higher trust and health satisfaction, a small decrease in perceived stress, a lower resting heart rate, and stable-to-improved sleep regularity and duration. The relative strength of associations in this sample favors the anxiety change as a dominant predictor: the STAI delta has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D change (0.72) and the magnitude of that subjective anxiety increase is clinically meaningful (movement into the “anxious” classification). Given the participant’s very low baseline CES‑D (6/60), the negative correlation between initial CES‑D and change (−0.5) also suggests a pattern where those with lower initial scores can show increases subsequently.

Conclusion:
The multimodal data are mixed, but the most salient and strongly CES‑D–linked change is an increase in trait anxiety accompanied by reduced socializing and modest increases in within‑day physiological variability. These signals outweigh the protective changes (higher self‑esteem, improved health satisfaction, stable/good sleep) when considered in light of the correlation structure provided. On balance, the evidence indicates a net increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

28312,-1.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report symptom and functioning changes:
Compared with the prior wave, the participant reports clear reductions in subjective stress and trait anxiety alongside a small improvement in self-esteem. The Perceived Stress score fell by 5 points (23 → 18; Z‑score delta ≈ -0.61), and the STAI–Trait dropped from 48 to 43 (delta -5; Z‑score delta -0.4), though STAI classification remained in the “anxious” range. Rosenberg Self‑Esteem rose by one point (35 → 36; small positive Z‑score change). Other self‑report indices of functioning are largely stable: BMI is unchanged, self‑rated happiness is unchanged, and trust increased slightly. Together these self‑report changes (notably lower stress and anxiety with modestly higher self‑esteem) point toward reduced affective distress and improved self‑appraisal relative to the previous assessment.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep control:
Objective and subjective sleep indicators moved in a direction typically associated with better mood outcomes. Median nightly sleep duration increased by ~38 minutes (from 7h35m to 8h14m; Z‑score now +1.06), and night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration decreased markedly (SD from 123 minutes to 36 minutes; Z‑score of delta ≈ -1.96), indicating more consistent nightly sleep. Median sleep start shifted later by ~26 minutes with little change in start‑time variability. Subjective reports show no change in usual weekday sleep duration but a higher “ideal” weekday sleep target (7 → 8 hours) and a decline in perceived control over sleep amount. Overall, the objective pattern — longer, more regular sleep — is generally associated with decreased depressive symptoms.

Wearable physiological activity and circadian rhythm:
Cardiovascular and circadian summary metrics show a mixed pattern. Mean and daytime hourly heart rates are substantially lower in the current aggregated profile than previously (e.g., many daytime hourly means decreased by large amounts), and resting heart rate shows a small decrease (61.0 → 60.4 bpm). Cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude declined substantially (mesor −12.9 bpm, amplitude −4.7 bpm; both large negative Z‑score deltas), while intradaily variability increased (delta +0.23; Z‑score of delta ≈ +1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours dropped notably (delta −0.25; Z‑score of delta −1.79). Interdaily stability changed negligibly. In sum, overall cardiovascular tone appears lower, but the day–night rhythmicity and within‑day fragmentation indicate a weakening of a robust 24‑hour pattern (lower amplitude and autocorrelation) combined with increased fragmentation across the day. Lower resting and average heart rate can reflect reduced physiological arousal or improved fitness, whereas reduced amplitude and autocorrelation and higher intradaily variability are features sometimes linked to circadian dysregulation.

Activity, social behavior, and sedentary habits:
Behavioral context changed toward greater sedentary leisure time and somewhat reduced shared exercise. Time spent watching TV/videos and playing video games increased substantially compared with the prior wave (Z‑score deltas > +1), internet use rose modestly, and exercise with others decreased. Socializing time was stable. Increased sedentary recreational time with lower social exercise may offset some of the positive effects of improved sleep and reduced stress if sustained over time.

Synthesis relative to depressive burden (evidence for improvement):
Several cross‑modal signals that correlate meaningfully with depressive symptoms moved in directions consistent with decreased depressive burden. Notably: lower perceived stress and lower trait anxiety (both moderate decreases), modestly higher self‑esteem, longer and far more regular sleep, and a small reduction in resting heart rate. Many of these measures have nontrivial correlations with CES‑D change reported in the dataset (e.g., STAI delta correlation ≈ 0.72, stress delta correlation ≈ 0.26, self‑esteem delta correlation ≈ -0.48), and their observed directions (decreases in anxiety/stress, increase in self‑esteem and consistent sleep) align with expected reductions in depressive symptoms.

Synthesis relative to depressive burden (evidence for worsening or risk):
Countervailing signals include objective circadian weakening — large drops in mesor and amplitude, increased intradaily variability, and markedly reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation — which can reflect circadian irregularity that is sometimes associated with worse mood. Behavioral increases in sedentary screen time and reduced group exercise may also represent risk factors if persistent. However, the correlations between these circadian deltas and CES‑D change provided in the data are small, and several sleep improvements (longer, more regular sleep) tend to mitigate circadian‑related risk in practice.

Holistic conclusion on CES‑D direction:
Weighing all evidence, the balance of change favors decreased depressive symptom burden. Multiple self‑report mood indicators (stress, trait anxiety, self‑esteem) show change in directions typically associated with improvement, and objective sleep improved substantially in duration and consistency. Physiological signals present a mixed picture, with lower overall heart rate but weaker circadian amplitude and greater intradaily variability; these are concerning but carry smaller correlations to CES‑D change in the provided data and are offset by stronger, consistent improvements in self‑reported affect and sleep. The participant’s initial CES‑D (14/60, near the sample mean) and the pattern of concurrent symptom improvement further support a net reduction rather than worsening of depressive burden.

26800,0.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report and affective indicators:
Self-report measures show several notable shifts consistent with improved mood and self-concept. Trait anxiety on the STAI fell substantially (40 → 30; Δ = −10), and this change has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change in the dataset (Δ correlation = 0.72), meaning decreases in trait anxiety in this sample tend to accompany decreases in depressive symptoms. Rosenberg self-esteem increased (45 → 50; Δ = +5; Δ correlation = −0.48), and subjective happiness moved from “pretty happy” to “very happy” (Δ Z ≈ 1.55; Δ correlation = −0.27); both directions (higher self‑esteem, greater happiness) are associated in the dataset with reductions in CES‑D. Countervailing self-report evidence is modest: perceived stress rose from 21 to 25 (Δ = +4; Δ correlation = 0.26), a pattern that is associated with increases in CES‑D in the sample but the magnitude of this stress increase is moderate compared with the large change in anxiety and improvements in self‑esteem and happiness.

Sleep and circadian behavior:
Both subjective and wearable-derived sleep/circadian measures moved in a direction typically associated with better mood. Median nightly sleep increased by about 30 minutes and the participant reports gaining control over sleep duration; sleep latency remained short. Wearable sleep timing shifted earlier (median sleep start advanced ≈1 hour 27 minutes) and sleep timing variability decreased, indicating more regular bedtimes. Circadian rhythm metrics from heart rate corroborate these changes: interdaily stability increased markedly (Δ = +0.32; Z‑score of Δ = 2.41) and amplitude increased substantially (from 6.06 to 12.74; Z‑score of Δ = 2.26), reflecting stronger, more regular daily structure. The change in sleep start time has a moderate negative correlation with CES‑D change (Δ correlation = −0.40), consistent with earlier, more regular sleep being associated with reductions in depressive symptoms.

Physiology and daily heart-rate patterning:
Aggregate hourly heart‑rate patterns indicate lower nocturnal heart rates on average compared with the prior period and a preserved daytime activity-related elevation; resting heart rate increased slightly (47.8 → 50.4 bpm) but remains low relative to the study population (Z ≈ −1.0). The marked increase in circadian amplitude and interdaily stability together suggest stronger, more regular autonomic/behavioral rhythms, which are generally linked with better affective regulation. The small increase in resting heart rate and the modest daytime peaks do not provide strong evidence of worsening on their own given the larger magnitude of improvements in rhythm regularity and nocturnal quiescence.

Behavioral habits and social factors:
Exercise frequency increased for solo exercise (from <1–2×/month to 1–2×/week) and social exercise appeared for the first time at a low frequency; sports participation declined. Time spent on video gaming and other sedentary hobbies increased from minimal to moderate levels. Socializing time remained stable. Trust and health satisfaction show small positive changes. Overall, behavioral data include mixed signals: increased physical activity frequency and social exercise are favorable for mood, whereas increased sedentary leisure could be neutral or unfavorable. The net behavioral pattern leans positive due to gains in regular activity and social contact, albeit with some increased sedentary engagement.

Evidence weighing for worsening versus improvement:
Evidence consistent with a worsening CES‑D score is limited and relatively modest in magnitude: perceived stress increased moderately and resting heart rate rose slightly; increased sedentary hobby and gaming time are small potential risk signals. By contrast, multiple higher‑magnitude and theoretically relevant signals point toward improvement or stability: a large reduction in trait anxiety (strongly predictive in the sample of CES‑D change), increases in self‑esteem and subjective happiness, longer and more regular sleep with earlier sleep timing, and marked improvements in circadian regularity and amplitude. The participant’s baseline CES‑D was low (7/60; Z ≈ −0.66), which constrains large absolute decreases in CES‑D but does not negate the direction indicated by convergent multimodal signals.

Conclusion — overall direction of change in depressive burden:
Taking the pattern across self-report, sleep, circadian rhythm, physiology, and behavior as a whole, the preponderance of evidence supports a stable or reduced depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. The strongest single predictors in the dataset (large STAI decrease, increased self‑esteem and happiness, earlier and more regular sleep, and markedly improved interdaily stability and amplitude) outweigh the modest adverse signals (moderate stress increase, small rise in resting heart rate, and greater sedentary leisure). In summary, the data are most consistent with stable or decreased CES‑D burden compared with the previous collection.

60396,6.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological analysis:

Sleep and sleep-related self-report show a clear shift toward shorter, more irregular sleep. Wearable median sleep duration declined to roughly 6 hours 22 minutes (Z = -1.10) from 7 hours 23 minutes (previous Z = 0.26); the change is large in magnitude relative to the study sample (Z-score of the delta ≈ -1.36). Night-to-night timing variability increased sharply: sleep start time standard deviation rose from ~53 minutes to ~153 minutes (Δ = +100 minutes; Z-score of the delta ≈ +2.04), indicating substantially more variable bedtimes. Self-report aligns with this pattern: normal weekday sleep duration dropped by ~0.5 hours and the participant reports less perceived control over sleep. Reductions in duration combined with markedly greater timing variability are commonly associated with worsened mood and decreased circadian stability and therefore are a notable signal toward increased depressive burden.

Cardiovascular and circadian measures indicate altered daytime arousal and reduced rhythm regularity. Resting heart rate increased from 45.1 to 53.0 bpm (Δ = +7.9 bpm; Z-score of the delta ≈ +1.71), and the hourly aggregated heart-rate profile shows elevated daytime heart rates (notably mid-morning peaks higher than previously). Mesor and amplitude from cosinor analysis increased (mesor Δ ≈ +8.5 bpm, Z-score of the delta ≈ +2.09), while parametric and non-parametric rhythm-consistency indicators moved in a direction suggesting loss of stable daily structure: interdaily stability fell from 0.37 to 0.18 (Z ≈ -2.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours decreased markedly (0.31 → 0.02; Z-score of the delta ≈ -2.07). Intradaily variability also declined, but given the large fall in interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation and the large shift of acrophase (earlier peak time, from ~6:18 PM to ~2:30 PM), the pattern is best interpreted as a disruption of consistent day-to-day circadian structure accompanied by higher baseline cardiac activity. Together these point to increased physiological arousal and weaker day-to-day circadian regularity—both signals that often accompany worsening depressive symptoms.

Self-report trait and behavioral measures are mixed but include salient negative changes. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased from 42 to 46 (Δ = +4; Z-score of the delta ≈ +0.76); the dataset reports a strong positive correlation between STAI change and CES-D change (Δ correlation ≈ +0.72), so this increase in chronic anxiety is an important indicator that depressive symptoms may have worsened. Perceived health satisfaction fell dramatically (from 5.44 to 1.44; Δ = -4.0; Z-score of the delta ≈ -3.75), a large-magnitude decline in physical-health appraisal that is psychologically salient even though the provided delta-correlation with CES-D is small. Substance use patterns shifted modestly toward greater alcohol frequency (beer usage increased) and a small uptick in incidental recreational drug use; these are behavioral changes that can be associated with worsening mood in some contexts. Offsetting signals are present but smaller: self-esteem rose by 1 point (a small change, with an inverse correlation to CES-D change), exercise frequency (especially exercising alone) increased, and reported stress decreased slightly (20 vs 21 previously). Social engagement measures (time socializing) were essentially unchanged. Overall, the larger-magnitude and higher-correlation signals (increased trait anxiety, large drop in health satisfaction, increased alcohol frequency) favor an interpretation of worsening mood burden.

Weighing evidence for worsening versus improvement/stability:

Evidence pointing toward worsening CES-D burden
- Large, objective reductions in sleep duration and a marked increase in sleep-timing variability (wearable-recorded) — changes commonly associated with worse depressive symptoms.  
- Large decreases in interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of heart-rate rhythms, together with an earlier acrophase and elevated resting heart rate and daytime HR peaks — consistent with increased physiological arousal and disrupted circadian regularity.  
- A meaningful increase in trait anxiety (STAI Δ = +4) with a reported strong positive correlation to CES-D change (Δ correlation ≈ +0.72).  
- A very large decline in perceived health satisfaction (Δ = -4.0), a high-magnitude subjective change likely to negatively affect mood.  
- Increased alcohol-use frequency and slightly increased recreational drug exposure, which can co-occur with worsening mood.

Evidence pointing toward improvement or stability
- Small improvements or stabilizing signals: slight increase in self-esteem (small magnitude), increased exercise frequency, and a marginal decrease in self-reported stress (Δ = -1). Socializing time was stable. The magnitudes and reported correlations for these changes are small, and some correlations with CES-D change are weak or near zero.

Holistic assessment and conclusion:
The preponderance of objective physiological and sleep signals (shorter sleep, greater timing variability, disrupted interdaily rhythm, elevated resting HR) combined with a clinically meaningful increase in trait anxiety and a dramatic drop in health satisfaction provides convergent evidence consistent with an increase in depressive symptom burden since the prior assessment. Countervailing signals (slight rise in exercise and small self-esteem gain) are modest in magnitude and do not offset the larger, multi-domain negative changes. The participant’s initial CES‑D score was low (8/60), but the pattern of multimodal changes—particularly sleep and circadian dysregulation and rising anxiety—supports that depressive symptoms have likely increased overall.

92412,0.0,"Multimodal summary and overall pattern
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant shows a mixture of favorable physiological and sleep-related changes alongside some small-to-moderate behavioral signals that could be interpreted as stress- or social- role related. Objective sleep and circadian indicators show the largest, most coherent improvements: median nightly sleep increased by about 32 minutes (from ~7 h 48 m to ~8 h 20 m) while night-to-night variability in sleep duration dropped substantially (SD decreased from ~62 minutes to 23 minutes). Sleep start time shifted earlier by ~1.5 hours and became far more consistent (SD reduced from ~49 minutes to 14 minutes). Concurrently, circadian regularity as measured by interdaily stability increased modestly (0.55 → 0.61) and overall rest-related cardiovascular measures moved in a direction consistent with reduced physiological arousal (resting heart rate decreased by 3.6 bpm; mesor declined). These objective sleep and circadian changes are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden and greater physiological stability.

Self-report affective and psychological traits
Self-reported anxiety (Trait STAI) declined by 4 points (32 → 28), a change that has a relatively strong positive correlation with change in CES-D in this dataset (delta correlation 0.72). Interpreted in context, the reduction in trait anxiety would be expected to accompany a decrease in depressive symptoms. Global self-esteem fell slightly (−1 point) but remains relatively high in the sample (Z-score positive), and its delta has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D change (delta correlation −0.48), meaning the small decline in self-esteem could marginally predict an increase in CES-D; however the magnitude is small. Self-rated stress increased by 3 points (16 → 19); this increase had a small positive delta-correlation with CES-D change (0.26), indicating some risk that rising stress could push depressive symptoms upward. Overall self-reported happiness remained at “very happy,” and health satisfaction increased by 1 point, so self-report affect is mixed but more often favorable than not.

Behavioral and social activity signals
Several behavioral habit shifts are noteworthy. The participant stopped exercising with others (from “three times a week or more” to “not at all”), a marked change in social physical activity (Z-score of this delta large and negative). Time spent socializing with friends is unchanged in the reported bands, but recreational alcohol use increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month” for both beer and wine/liquor (small upticks). Daily recreation such as watching video content and listening to music decreased; overall sedentary-hobby engagement stayed minimal. The loss of group exercise is the most salient social-behavioral change and could modestly elevate risk for increased depressive symptoms through reduced social contact and structured activity, though other exercise frequency (alone) and sports participation were maintained.

Physiological circadian pattern and hourly heart rate profile
Cardiovascular circadian metrics present a picture of greater regularity and lower tonic arousal: interdaily stability rose, amplitude was stable-to-slightly increased, and mesor and resting heart rate decreased. The aggregated hourly heart-rate series shows lower mean values across much of the day and night compared with the prior wave (notably lower nighttime and many daytime hours), consistent with the lower resting heart rate and greater cardiac calm. There are some hour-to-hour differences (and a few large point differences in isolated hours in the previous wave), but the summary circadian measures and reduced variability in sleep timing support improved physiological regulation rather than deterioration.

Weighing evidence for change in depressive burden
Evidence consistent with a reduction or stability in depressive burden: substantial, coherent improvements in objective sleep quantity, timing, and regularity; decreased resting heart rate and modest improvements in circadian stability; a decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) that correlates strongly with CES-D change in this dataset; stable high self-reported happiness and improved health satisfaction. Evidence consistent with increased depressive burden: a modest rise in perceived stress, a slight drop in self-esteem, cessation of exercising with others, and small increases in alcohol use—each of these has either small effect sizes or weak correlations with CES-D change in the provided data. The participant’s initial CES-D score was very low (3/60; Z = −1.07), which statistically can be associated with regression toward higher scores (the initial CES-D correlates −0.5 with change), but the multimodal physiological and affective signals overall point toward maintained low symptom burden or modest improvement rather than clear worsening.

Conclusion
Considering the relative magnitudes and coherence of the signals, the preponderance of evidence—especially robust improvements in objective sleep regularity/timing and reductions in physiological arousal and trait anxiety—supports that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has remained stable or moved in a direction of slight improvement rather than worsening.

14737,-8.0,"Multimodal psychological and behavioral synthesis:
Across self-report measures, the participant shows robust, directionally consistent improvements on several constructs that are commonly linked to depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined substantially from 45 to 32 (Δ = −13, large negative Z-change), moving the participant from the “anxious” to “not anxious” range; the magnitude of this drop is notable given the strong sample-level association of anxiety with depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem increased from 34 to a maximal score of 40 (Δ = +6), and perceived stress decreased from 20 to 16 (Δ = −4). Health satisfaction also increased modestly. These concurrent improvements in anxiety, self‑esteem, stress, and health appraisal form a coherent cluster of positive self‑reported psychological change that would typically accompany a reduction in depressive symptom severity.

Behavioral and lifestyle changes consistent with reduced depressive burden:
Objective and self‑reported behaviors point to improved sleep and social/physical activity patterns. Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration increased by about 1 hour and 2 minutes (from 6h3m to 7h5m) with a large reduction in night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD down by ~44 minutes). Sleep start time remained late (~02:00) but became more consistent (sleep start SD reduced by ~61 minutes). Self‑reported normal weekday sleep duration remained unchanged at 6 hours, indicating some subject–objective discrepancy, but the objective increase and reduced variability are in a direction associated with better mood regulation. Socializing time increased (from ~16–30 minutes to 1–2 hours), and frequency of exercise increased (exercising alone moved from monthly to weekly). Sedentary hobby time decreased substantially. Small increases in alcohol use (from none to 1–2 times/month) and a modest rise in BMI (≈ +1.1) are present but relatively minor compared with the broader pattern of healthier sleep, greater social engagement, and more frequent exercise.

Physiological and circadian rhythm indicators:
Circadian regularity and heart‑rate–derived rhythm metrics show improved structure. Interdaily stability rose from 0.40 to 0.55 (Δ = +0.15, Z-change large positive), and autocorrelation at 24 h increased similarly, indicating stronger day‑to‑day consistency in heart rate rhythms. Intradaily variability remained essentially unchanged (small decrease), while amplitude increased modestly and mesor (mean modeled heart rate) declined slightly (Δ ≈ −4.3 bpm). Resting heart rate is low overall (≈53 bpm) and changed negligibly. Aggregated hourly heart‑rate profiles indicate preserved daytime peaks and slightly different hourly values compared with the prior wave, but no pattern suggesting sustained autonomic hyperarousal across the day; in sum, the circadian and autonomic profile is more regular and does not show deterioration.

Integration and implications for CES‑D change:
Multiple independent data streams converge on an interpretation of decreased depressive symptom burden. The strongest signals are reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress, a sizable gain in self‑esteem, objectively longer and more regular sleep, increased social engagement, and more frequent exercise — all changes that, in the literature and in this dataset, typically co‑occur with reductions in depressive symptom severity. Adverse signals are limited and modest (slight BMI increase and infrequent alcohol use initiation), and physiological markers (resting HR, circadian stability) support improved regulation rather than worsening. The participant’s initial CES‑D score was modest (14/60), and available correlational guidance should not override the multi‑domain pattern: the preponderance of evidence supports an overall decrease or stability with improvement in depressive burden rather than an increase.

Conclusion:
Considering the combined self‑report, behavioral, sleep, and physiological data, the overall direction is consistent with decreased (or at minimum stable/decreased) depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

28653,15.0,"Multimodal self-report profile — psychological traits and lifestyle:
Since the prior wave the participant shows pronounced change on several trait and self-report measures relevant to affective burden. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased substantially (+17 points; previous 29 → current 46; Z-score delta +2.43), shifting classification from “not anxious” to “anxious.” Self‑esteem dropped markedly (Rosenberg RSES −14 points; 49 → 35; Z‑score of delta −2.57). Subjective mood descriptors also shifted downward (from “very happy” to “Happy”), trust ratings fell (−1.0 point; Z‑score of delta −2.58), and satisfaction with physical health declined (−1.56 on a 1–7 scale). These changes (large STAI increase and large RSES decrease) are both individually sizable and have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES‑D change in the provided data (STAI delta correlation 0.72; RSES delta correlation −0.47), indicating that these trait changes are consistent with risk for increased depressive symptoms. Countervailing self-report signals are present but smaller in magnitude: perceived daily stress declined modestly (21 → 17), and time spent socializing and listening to music increased, which could provide some behavioral buffering.

Sleep timing, duration, and subjective sleep control:
Sleep patterns shifted toward later and shorter sleep. Median sleep start time moved later by ~1 hour and 6 minutes (00:16 → 01:23), and median objectively measured sleep duration decreased by ~1 hour 27 minutes (8:04 → 7:31). Subjective “normal weekday” sleep duration also declined (8 → 7 hours). The participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration compared with the previous wave. Shorter total sleep and later bedtimes occur alongside a meaningful correlation in the dataset linking later sleep timing to change in CES‑D (sleep start delta correlation −0.42), suggesting later sleep could be associated with worsening depressive symptoms in this sample. Night-to-night variability in sleep start actually decreased (more regular timing), while variability in duration remained similar; thus timing shifted later and became more consistent, but overall sleep quantity fell.

Circadian and wearable-derived activity structure:
Aggregate circadian measures derived from heart rate indicate a weakening and phase delay of daily rhythmicity. Amplitude decreased substantially (19.47 → 13.88; Z‑score of delta −1.90), interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation declined (interdaily stability 0.64 → 0.47; autocorrelation 0.48 → 0.24), and the acrophase shifted later (previous 3:36 PM → current 4:40 PM). These changes together reflect reduced robustness and a later phase of the participant’s heart‑rate circadian rhythm. Reduced amplitude and stability of circadian signals have been linked with affective symptom increases in prior literature and are consistent with other adverse changes observed here.

Cardiovascular nocturnal profile and resting physiology:
Resting heart rate remained essentially unchanged (53.0 → 53.4 bpm), but the hourly aggregated heart‑rate profile shows higher nocturnal/overnight values in the current period relative to the prior one (for example 12–1am: ~60.6 → 73.4 bpm; 2–3am: ~53.3 → 60.1 bpm). Daytime afternoon peaks are lower than in the previous wave (prior very high afternoon peaks reduced), while night and early‑morning hourly heart rates are elevated. This pattern — preserved resting HR but higher aggregated overnight heart rate — can reflect increased nocturnal physiological arousal or altered sleep physiology and aligns with the shorter sleep duration and later sleep timing noted above.

Behavioral routines, social and academic functioning:
Several behavioral metrics shifted. Exercise frequency when alone decreased substantially (from 1–2 times/week to 1–2 times/month), while exercise with others remained frequent (three times/week or more). Recreational substance use remained low and unchanged. Time spent socializing and listening to music increased appreciably (socializing from 16–30 minutes → 1–2 hours; listening to music from ≤15 minutes → 1–2 hours), which are potential social/behavioral supports. Academic performance shows a decline in recent GPA (3.52 → 3.47 → 2.80 across the listed terms), indicating worsening academic outcomes concurrent with the other changes.

Synthesis of signals relevant to CES‑D change:
Evidence consistent with increasing depressive symptom burden: (1) a large rise in trait anxiety and a large fall in self‑esteem — both sizable and highly relevant to depressive symptomatology (STAI delta correlates positively with CES‑D change: 0.72; RSES delta correlates with CES‑D change in the expected direction), (2) later and shorter objective and subjective sleep (sleep start later by ~1h, sleep duration down ~1.5h) combined with elevated overnight heart rate suggesting greater nocturnal arousal, and (3) weakened circadian amplitude and reduced interdaily stability (notable decreases in amplitude and autocorrelation) which are associated with worse mood outcomes. Additional supportive indicators include reduced trust, lowered health satisfaction, reductions in solitary exercise, and a drop in GPA. Evidence for improvement or stability is weaker and smaller in magnitude: reported stress decreased modestly and social time increased alongside increased perceived control over sleep, which could buffer mood, but these are less robust and are of smaller effect size compared with the trait anxiety and self‑esteem shifts.

Conclusion regarding direction of change in CES‑D burden:
Taken holistically, the preponderance of moderate-to-large adverse changes (marked STAI increase, large self‑esteem decrease, shorter and later sleep, circadian weakening, elevated overnight heart rate, declines in trust and health satisfaction, and academic decline) outweigh the smaller, potentially protective changes (reduced perceived stress, increased socializing, and more perceived sleep control). Given the magnitude of the trait anxiety and self‑esteem changes and their stated correlations with CES‑D change, the balance of evidence points toward an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

95559,-6.0,"Self-report measures show several substantive improvements in affective and psychosocial indicators that are typically associated with reduced depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI declined by 4 points (29 → 25), a change that is both numerically meaningful and, given the reported positive correlation between STAI change and CES‑D change (Δ correlation = 0.72), is indicative of concurrent reductions in depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem increased by 3 points (45 → 48) and the participant rated themselves as “very happy” compared with “pretty happy” previously; the self‑esteem change is negatively correlated with CES‑D change (Δ correlation = -0.48), consistent with an expected decrease in depressive burden. Health satisfaction also rose markedly (3.56 → 4.89), and time spent socializing increased; both of these shifts further align with improved mood and social engagement. Academic performance (GPA) shows an upward trajectory across terms, which can be a distal indicator of improved functioning. Small negative signals in the self‑report domain include a one‑point increase in perceived stress and a slight reduction in trust, but these are modest in magnitude relative to the more robust positive changes in anxiety, self‑esteem, happiness, and health satisfaction.

Objective sleep behavior from the wearable and complementary self‑report converge on a clearer sleep pattern and greater sleep quantity. Median nightly sleep increased by about one hour (from 6 h 39 m to 7 h 41 m) and sleep start time shifted earlier by approximately 1 hour 33 minutes. Night‑to‑night variability in both duration and start time decreased substantially (sleep duration SD decreased from 97 to 44 minutes; start time SD decreased), indicating more regular sleep scheduling. Several of these sleep changes have nontrivial correlations with CES‑D change in the dataset (for example, earlier sleep onset has a reported Δ correlation = -0.40), lending support to the interpretation that improved sleep timing and consistency are associated with reductions in depressive symptoms in this participant.

Wearable circadian and cardiorespiratory metrics present a mixed but not strongly contradictory picture. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation increased modestly, suggesting greater day‑to‑day regularity of the heart‑rate rhythm, while intradaily variability increased (greater within‑day fragmentation) and amplitude of the fitted circadian rhythm decreased slightly. Resting heart rate rose by ~2.3 bpm (53.5 → 55.8). Overall, the circadian changes (higher interdaily stability and autocorrelation) are consistent with better daily regularity, which can be protective against mood symptoms, but the decreased amplitude and slight increase in intradaily fragmentation and resting heart rate are potential physiological signals that could reflect either increased activity/stress or mild circadian blunting. These wearable shifts are relatively small in magnitude and have weak correlations with CES‑D change in the provided data, so they do not strongly countermand the clearer self‑report and sleep improvements.

Weighing evidence for worsening versus improvement: indicators that could point toward an increased CES‑D score are limited and relatively small in magnitude — a one‑point rise in perceived stress, a modest increase in BMI, a slight decrease in trust, and a small increase in resting heart rate and intradaily variability. The dataset flags few strong positive correlations between these worsening signals and CES‑D change. In contrast, multiple convergent, larger‑magnitude improvements (notably reduced trait anxiety, increased self‑esteem, more happiness, substantial increases in sleep duration and regularity, increased health satisfaction, and more social activity) are either directly correlated with CES‑D change in the expected direction or are well‑established correlates of lower depressive symptoms.

Holistic interpretation: the preponderance of evidence across self‑report and wearable domains indicates improved affective state and functional markers consistent with a decrease or stable lower level of depressive symptoms compared with the prior wave. Improvements in anxiety, self‑esteem, subjective happiness, sleep quantity and regularity, social engagement, and health satisfaction form a coherent pattern that outweighs the modest opposing signals in stress, BMI, and some small circadian changes. Given the initial CES‑D score was already low (8/60), the data are most consistent with either stability at a low symptom level or further small improvement rather than a worsening.

59592,1.0,"Multimodal self-report summary:
Across self-report instruments the strongest signals are reduced anxiety and perceived stress alongside small declines in self-evaluative measures. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) fell by 4 points (46 → 42), a moderate change, and this reduction is strongly associated with CES-D change in the dataset (Δ-correlation = 0.72), which supports an expectation of concurrent reduction in depressive symptoms. Perceived stress also declined by 4 points (23 → 19). In contrast, self-esteem dropped slightly (35 → 34) and overall health satisfaction fell (3.67 → 3.22); these decreases, while modest, are risk-relevant because lower self-esteem and health satisfaction are conventionally associated with greater depressive burden (the self-esteem Δ has a negative correlation with CES-D change in the dataset, indicating that reductions in self-esteem are linked to worse CES-D outcomes). Daily activities and social engagement show little systematic deterioration: alcohol use decreased, solo exercise frequency was unchanged, and time spent socializing remained stable. Subjective sleep reports are mixed: the participant reports a one-hour reduction in ""normal weekday sleep"" (7.0 → 6.0 hours) despite indicating the same ideal sleep duration; sleep latency and subjective sense of control over sleep are essentially unchanged.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian and physiological signals:
Objective wearable metrics point to net improvements in circadian regularity and cardiac indices. Median sleep onset advanced by approximately 1 hour 5 minutes (from ~01:49 to ~00:54), and median nightly sleep duration increased by ~22 minutes (from ~6:57 to ~7:19). Night-to-night variability in sleep onset and duration increased modestly, however (standard deviation of start times and duration rose), indicating more variability even as median timing and duration shifted earlier/longer. Circadian measures derived from heart rate show a substantial decrease in intradaily variability (0.83 → 0.57; Z-change ≈ -2.06), which indicates reduced fragmentation of daily activity/rest patterns — a change typically interpreted as improved circadian consolidation. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (0.19 Δ), also consistent with a stronger 24-hour rhythm; mesor and amplitude changed only slightly (minor amplitude reduction). Resting heart rate declined by 2.8 bpm (66.6 → 63.8), a small-to-moderate physiologic improvement suggestive of reduced autonomic arousal or improved cardiovascular recovery. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show somewhat lower nighttime heart rates on average and an earlier daytime activity/acrophase (acrophase shifted earlier from ~4:51 PM to ~2:50 PM), consistent with the earlier sleep timing captured in the wearables.

Evidence consistent with decreased depressive burden:
- Reduced trait anxiety (STAI Δ = -4) and reduced perceived stress (Δ = -4) are both changes that, given their positive correlations with CES-D change in this dataset, point toward a decrease in depressive symptoms. The strong STAI–CES-D Δ correlation (0.72) makes the anxiety change one of the most informative self-report predictors in this case.  
- Objective circadian consolidation improved (large drop in intradaily variability and increased 24-hour autocorrelation) and resting heart rate declined; both physiological patterns are commonly associated with better mood regulation and lower depressive symptomatology.  
- Objective sleep timing moved earlier and median nightly sleep duration increased modestly, consistent with behavioral adjustments that often accompany mood improvement.

Evidence consistent with increased or stable/worse depressive burden:
- Self-esteem and health satisfaction showed modest declines; these changes are associated with poorer mood outcomes in the dataset and could counterbalance some of the improvement signal.  
- Subjective report of normal weekday sleep decreased by an hour, and variability in sleep timing increased; perceived reductions in sleep and greater variability can be experienced negatively and have links to mood worsening.  
- Some social/exercise indicators worsened slightly (e.g., exercising with others declined to none), which could influence mood maintenance even if overall recreation remained similar.

Holistic synthesis and directional assessment:
Weighing the sources together, the most robust and directionally consistent signals are reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress, improvements in objective circadian consolidation (large intradaily variability decrease, increased 24-hour autocorrelation), an earlier sleep schedule with a small increase in median objective sleep duration, and a modest reduction in resting heart rate. These changes are, in magnitude and in their documented correlations with CES-D change in the dataset, more strongly predictive of a reduction in depressive symptom burden than the modest negative signals (small declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction, increased sleep variability, and reduced group exercise). On balance, the multimodal pattern favors an overall decrease or stabilization toward lower depressive burden compared with the prior wave.

69831,-5.0,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological and affective measures:
Across the two waves the participant’s trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) remained unchanged (38 at both time points), indicating stability in self-reported chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem showed a small decline (36 → 35), a modest negative change in self-regard, while global subjective happiness remained essentially unchanged (""pretty happy""). Perceived stress declined markedly (16 → 7; a large absolute decrease and large negative Z-change), indicating a substantial reduction in the participant’s reported day-to-day stress burden. Trust in others and health satisfaction both increased modestly. Taken together, the dominant self-report signal is a substantial reduction in perceived stress accompanied by stable anxiety and only a small reduction in self-esteem.

Paragraph 2 — Sleep (subjective and wearable):
Objective sleep duration and timing are stable to slightly improved: median nightly duration increased marginally (8:00 → 8:02) and night-to-night variability decreased (SD 104 → 79 minutes), indicating more consistent sleep. Median sleep start time is essentially unchanged (~01:35–01:40). Subjectively, the participant reports the same sleep latency and the same typical weekday sleep duration (7 hours), but a reduction in the rated sense of control over sleep (from ""Strongly Agree"" to ""Agree"") and a lowered ideal weekday sleep target (8 → 7 hours). Overall the wearable-derived sleep metrics point toward slightly longer and more regular sleep, while subjective control over sleep decreased slightly.

Paragraph 3 — Circadian rhythm and heart rate physiology:
Heart-rate–derived circadian structure shows clearer 24-hour regularity: interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (autocorrelation Z-change large), while intradaily variability changed minimally. Mesor (overall mean HR) and resting heart rate both decreased (Mesor −3.7 bpm; RHR −2.7 bpm), and the amplitude was essentially unchanged. The aggregated hourly heart rate profile shows lower nocturnal and many diurnal hourly means compared with the prior wave. These changes are consistent with a stronger, more stable circadian rhythmicity and a modest reduction in tonic physiological arousal or an improvement in cardiovascular recovery. The circadian changes (notably the large increase in 24-h autocorrelation) represent one of the strongest wearable-derived signals in the dataset.

Paragraph 4 — Activity, sedentary behavior, and other behaviors:
Physical activity patterns shifted toward less structured sport participation (from ~1–2×/week to <1–2×/month) and no reported exercise; concurrently, sedentary recreational time increased (TV/videos 2–3→3–4 hrs; sedentary hobby 1–2→2–3 hrs). Substance use patterns were unchanged. BMI increased modestly (15.6 → 16.95). Socializing time remained high. These behavioral shifts indicate decreased formal exercise and increased sedentary leisure time, which are potential negative contributors to mood over time despite other improvements.

Paragraph 5 — Weighing evidence for change in depressive burden:
Evidence consistent with decreased depressive burden: a large drop in perceived stress, improved sleep regularity and slightly longer sleep, increased circadian regularity (notably 24-h autocorrelation), decreased resting and mean HR — collectively these suggest lower physiological and subjective stress and better sleep-circadian organization, patterns commonly associated with reductions in depressive symptomatology. Evidence consistent with increased depressive risk or stability: a small decline in self-esteem, a substantive reduction in exercise and increase in sedentary behavior, and slightly reduced perceived control over sleep; these are risk or maintenance factors for depressive symptoms but changes are smaller in magnitude than the improvements noted above. Trait anxiety remained stable.

Overall interpretation and directional judgment:
On balance, the strongest and most consistent signals (large reduction in perceived stress, objectively more regular sleep and circadian rhythmicity, and lower resting/mean HR) point toward a net improvement or stability in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Negative signals (reduced exercise, small decline in self-esteem) are present but smaller in magnitude and less consistent with the physiological and stress-related improvements. Therefore the integrated evidence favors stable or decreased depressive burden rather than worsening.

79834,-2.0,"Multimodal self-report changes indicate a mixed but overall positive shift in psychological traits. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased by 4 points (37 → 33; Z-change ≈ -0.27), moving the participant further into the ""not anxious"" range. Self-esteem increased notably by 5 points (37 → 42; Z-change ≈ +0.95), a relatively large positive change in perceived self-worth. Self-reported perceived control over sleep increased from ""Somewhat Disagree"" to ""Agree,"" suggesting improved appraisals of sleep regulation. Countervailing self-report signals include a modest rise in perceived stress (19 → 22; Δ = +3, Z-change ≈ +1.11) and a decline in interpersonal trust (2.5 → 2.0), both of which may reflect situational stressors or social concerns. Overall, trait-level indicators (lower trait anxiety, higher self-esteem) moved in a direction typically associated with reduced depressive symptoms, while situational stress and social trust showed unfavorable but smaller-magnitude changes.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics show shorter but more regular sleep. Median nightly sleep decreased by approximately 1 hour 16 minutes (8h18 → 7h34), while night-to-night variability in sleep duration dropped substantially (SD fell from 85 to 32 minutes; Δ = -53 minutes, Z-change ≈ -1.16). Bedtime shifted slightly later (~14 minutes) with negligible change in start-time variability. The drop in average duration could be clinically meaningful if sustained, but the large reduction in variability and increased subjective control over sleep suggest greater predictability and perceived mastery of sleep scheduling. These sleep changes are complemented by stable self-reported health satisfaction and unchanged BMI, indicating no clear deterioration in general health status.

Cardiovascular and circadian features present a mixed pattern of lower baseline physiological arousal alongside increased within-day fragmentation. Resting heart rate decreased by ~4 bpm (59.65 → 55.6; Z-change ≈ -0.82), and MESOR and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm both declined modestly (MESOR Δ ≈ -4.3 bpm; amplitude Δ ≈ -1.8 bpm). Lower resting heart rate and reduced MESOR can reflect reduced tonic physiological arousal or improved fitness and are frequently associated with better mood or recovery. However, intradaily variability (a nonparametric marker of rhythm fragmentation) increased substantially (0.5 → 0.9; Z-change ≈ +2.62), indicating more frequent transitions between activity and rest within days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (0.21 → 0.37), which suggests an emergent daily regularity in the 24-hour pattern despite the higher short-term fragmentation. Aggregated hourly heart rate values are generally lower across many hours compared with the previous period, supporting the interpretation of reduced overall cardiovascular activation.

Synthesis and interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden: Evidence supporting a decrease or stability in depressive burden includes (1) a meaningful increase in self-esteem, (2) a decrease in trait anxiety, (3) reduced resting heart rate and MESOR consistent with lower tonic physiological arousal, and (4) markedly reduced night-to-night sleep variability and improved subjective control over sleep. These together point toward improved trait-level emotional functioning and more regular sleep-wake patterns, both associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Evidence suggesting potential worsening or risk for increased depressive symptoms is limited but notable: (1) a modest increase in self-reported stress, (2) decreased interpersonal trust, (3) a reduction in median sleep duration of ~1 hour (which could be problematic if persistent), and (4) a pronounced rise in intradaily variability, indicating greater within-day fragmentation of activity and rest. The magnitude of the positive trait changes (self-esteem and STAI) and the physiological indications of lower resting heart rate and tighter sleep regularity are comparatively larger and more directly linked to mood resilience than the smaller adverse signals.

Weighing the pattern of changes holistically—greater increases in self-esteem and reductions in trait anxiety, improved perceived control over sleep, lower resting heart rate, and much more consistent night-to-night sleep—against the smaller-magnitude adverse changes (moderate rise in stress, lower trust, shorter sleep duration, and increased intraday fragmentation), the balance of evidence favors stability or modest improvement in depressive symptom burden rather than a clear worsening.

47810,-11.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological analysis:

Self-report trait and affective measures show a mixed but concerning pattern. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased by 3 points and crossed into the ""anxious"" classification; the change in STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change (r = 0.72), which indicates that the observed rise in chronic anxiety proneness is likely to be associated with an increase in depressive symptoms. Self-esteem decreased by 2 points (RSES), and the change in self-esteem is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D change (r = -0.48), meaning the drop in self-worth is also aligned with worsening depressive burden. Subjective stress scores decreased by 3 points (a small negative signal for depressive burden), and the participant reports feeling “Very happy” versus “pretty happy” previously; the increase in reported happiness is associated with lower CES-D change (delta correlation = -0.26). Health satisfaction fell substantially and social activities that involve others (exercising with others, socializing time) declined, suggesting reduced perceived physical wellbeing and some social withdrawal. Overall, self-report data contain both improvement signals (lower stress, higher momentary happiness) and stronger trait-level signals (higher anxiety, lower self-esteem, reduced social engagement, worse health satisfaction) that are more typically linked with increased depressive burden.

Sleep and wearable-derived circadian/physiological metrics provide a similarly mixed picture but with notable indications of dysregulation. Sleep duration measured by the wearable increased by ~51 minutes (median sleep 6 h 40 min → 7 h 31 min), and night-to-night variability in sleep timing decreased slightly—both changes that might be expected to protect mood. Subjective sleep control, however, moved from “Somewhat Disagree” to “Disagree,” indicating reduced perceived control over sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show a meaningful reduction in interdaily stability (0.58 → 0.36; Z-change large and negative) and a drop in amplitude (13.32 → 10.31), reflecting less stable and blunted circadian structure across days. These circadian changes are typically associated with poorer mood regulation and are notable despite small direct correlations with CES-D change in this dataset.

Physiological arousal patterns also shifted. Resting heart rate increased by ~3.7 bpm, and aggregated hourly heart rate shows higher mean heart rates across many nocturnal and early-morning hours compared to the prior wave (most strikingly in the 2–4 AM hours). Elevated nocturnal heart rate alongside reduced circadian amplitude/stability suggests increased nocturnal physiological arousal and reduced circadian robustness, which can accompany worsening mood or subclinical activation even when total sleep time increases. Activity-based behaviors indicate a drop in social exercise and modest reductions in time spent socializing and using the internet; small increases in solitary leisure (e.g., reading) are present. Taken together, the wearable signals point toward emerging circadian/physiological dysregulation (reduced stability/amplitude and higher nocturnal HR) that are commonly linked to increased depressive symptomatology.

Evidence for worsening versus improvement in depressive burden:

Evidence consistent with worsening depressive burden
- Increase in trait anxiety (STAI +3) with a strong positive correlation to CES-D change (r = 0.72). The transition into an “anxious” classification is a salient risk indicator for increased depressive symptoms.
- Decrease in self-esteem (RSES -2) with a moderate inverse correlation to CES-D change (r = -0.48), consistent with vulnerability to increased depression.
- Large reductions in circadian regularity (interdaily stability drop) and amplitude, as well as rising resting and nocturnal heart rates, indicating physiological/circadian dysregulation commonly associated with worsening mood.
- Reduced social engagement with others (exercising with others dropped to none; decreased socializing time), which often accompanies and predicts increases in depressive symptoms.
- Decline in health satisfaction and small declines in BMI, which may reflect worsening perceived health or wellbeing.

Evidence consistent with improvement or stability in depressive burden
- Wearable-measured median sleep duration increased substantially (~51 minutes) and sleep variability did not worsen; better objective sleep duration can relate to improved mood.
- Self-reported stress decreased by 3 points, and momentary happiness increased from “pretty happy” to “Very happy”; both are signals pointing away from increased depressive burden.
- Several behavioral leisure indicators (less internet use, more reading) could represent healthier habits or a change in leisure that is not necessarily pathological.

Holistic synthesis and directional assessment:

When weighing the evidence, the most diagnostically relevant and strongly correlated signals favor an increase in depressive burden. The rise in trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES-D change) and the decrease in self-esteem (moderately correlated) are trait-level affective changes that carry substantial weight in predicting increases in depressive symptoms. These trait changes are complemented by objective markers of physiological and circadian dysregulation (marked drop in interdaily stability, lower amplitude, higher resting and nocturnal heart rate) and decreased social engagement—collectively patterns that more often accompany worsening depressive states. Countervailing signs (increased total sleep, lower momentary stress, higher self-reported happiness) are notable but either have weaker correlations with CES-D change in this dataset or may reflect transient or compensatory states rather than durable improvement of underlying risk. On balance, the multimodal pattern points toward an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior data collection wave.

62246,4.0,"Multimodal summary
Across the two measurement waves the participant shows a mixed profile: objective sleep and circadian metrics moved in a direction typically considered protective (more sleep, more regular timing and stronger 24‑hour structure), while self‑report measures of affective state show modest deterioration (higher trait anxiety, higher perceived stress, and lower self‑esteem). Physiological indicators from the wearable are consistent with reduced tonic cardiovascular arousal (lower resting heart rate and a small decline in mesor) combined with an increased day–night contrast (greater amplitude and much higher interdaily stability/autocorrelation). Taken together, the pattern indicates improved behavioral regularity and sleep quantity but some worsening in subjective emotional well‑being.

Self-report affective and behavioral changes
Relative to the prior wave, the participant’s trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased by 3 points (Delta correlation with CES‑D change: 0.72), perceived stress increased by 2 points, and global self‑esteem declined by 4 points (Delta correlation with CES‑D change: -0.48). The participant’s report of control over their sleep shifted from “somewhat disagree” to “disagree,” suggesting reduced perceived agency over sleep despite objective improvements. Other behavioral self‑reports are mostly stable or show small positive lifestyle features: exercise frequency is maintained, substance use is unchanged, socializing remains similar, and some recreational screen time decreased. The self‑report pattern highlights an increase in internalizing symptoms (anxiety, stress, lower self‑esteem) that are known to covary with increases in depressive symptom reporting.

Wearable‑derived sleep, circadian, and cardiac metrics
Objective sleep duration increased modestly (median sleep +19 minutes) while night‑to‑night variability decreased (sleep duration SD reduced by 23 minutes; sleep start time SD reduced by 32 minutes). These point to more consistent, slightly longer sleep. Circadian measures derived from heart rate show a clearer strengthening of 24‑hour organization: interdaily stability rose substantially (Delta Z ~1.59), autocorrelation at 24 h increased strongly, and amplitude increased (Delta Z ~1.21). Resting heart rate decreased by ~1.8 bpm and the mesor fell, indicating lower average cardiac tone across the day. Hourly aggregated heart‑rate profiles show lower values across many hours compared with the prior wave, consistent with reduced overall physiological arousal. These objective changes generally align with patterns associated with reduced depressive symptoms (more regular sleep–wake timing and stronger circadian amplitude), and their correlations with CES‑D change in the dataset are small to modest.

Integrated interpretation regarding CES‑D change
The dataset contains mixed signals for change in depressive symptom burden. Several objective, behavioral and physiological indicators moved in directions typically associated with lower depressive symptoms (more total sleep and substantially greater circadian regularity and amplitude; lower resting heart rate). However, the participant’s subjective emotional measures—trait anxiety (+3), perceived stress (+2), and lower self‑esteem (−4)—are changes that correlate meaningfully with increases in CES‑D in this sample (notably STAI delta correlation = 0.72; self‑esteem delta correlation = −0.48). The initial CES‑D score was very low (4/60) and the negative correlation between initial CES‑D and change (−0.5) suggests that low baseline values in this sample are associated with larger upward shifts, which increases the plausibility of a subsequent increase. On balance, because the self‑reported affective deterioration (especially the sizable STAI change with a strong correlation to CES‑D change) is more directly tied to the construct measured by CES‑D than the physiological improvements, the preponderance of evidence points toward a net increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave, even if absolute symptom levels may remain low.

55424,2.0,"Multimodal summary and psychological symptom trends:
Across the two measurement waves the participant shows several convergent self-report signals consistent with increased internal distress. State-trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) rose substantially (57 → 65; Δ = +8, Z-Score Δ = 1.27) and the provided correlation between STAI change and CES-D change is large and positive (Δ correlation = 0.72), indicating that the observed anxiety increase is a strong predictor of concurrent increases in depressive symptoms in this sample. Perceived stress also increased (23 → 26; Δ = +3, Z-Score Δ = 1.11) and has a modest positive correlation with CES-D change (0.25), reinforcing the pattern of greater negative affect/strain. Self-esteem declined modestly (32 → 30; Δ = −2) and the change in self-esteem is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D change (Δ correlation = −0.48), which, given the direction of the self-esteem drop, is consistent with an expected increase in CES-D. The participant’s initial CES-D score is high (35/60, Z = 2.26), indicating substantial depressive symptom burden at baseline; the cohort-level correlation reported between initial CES-D and subsequent change (−0.5) suggests that higher initial scores tend, on average, to predict decreases later (regression toward the mean). However, the contemporaneous increases in anxiety and stress and the drop in self-esteem provide stronger direct evidence pointing toward worsening depressive symptoms in this individual across waves.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep perception:
Objective sleep duration increased slightly (median sleep 7h48m vs. prior 7h24m; Δ = +24 minutes), with low-to-negligible correlation of that duration change with CES-D change (Δ correlation = 0.11). Sleep timing shifted earlier by almost three hours (median sleep start 23:20 vs. 00:21; Δ ≈ −2:58), a large timing change. The reported correlation between change in sleep start time and CES-D change is moderate (−0.40). Interpreting the sign and direction together: the participant’s shift toward an earlier habitual sleep start time, given the negative correlation reported, is associated in the sample with increases in CES-D (i.e., the observed negative change in sleep-start combined with a negative correlation implies change in the direction that predicts higher CES-D). Sleep timing variability and nightly SD were essentially stable. In sum, objective sleep quantity changed only modestly, but the pronounced advance in sleep timing is a notable behavioral change that, based on the available sample-level association, aligns with worsening CES-D for this participant.

Activity, circadian rhythm, and physiological arousal:
Wearable-derived circadian metrics show mixed signals. Amplitude of the cosinor rhythm increased (12.92 → 14.52; Δ = +1.60, Z-Score now relatively elevated), while interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours decreased slightly. Intradaily variability was unchanged. The amplitude increase suggests larger day–night differences in heart-rate-derived activity/arousal, whereas small reductions in stability/autocorrelation indicate modestly less day-to-day regularity. Resting heart rate remained essentially stable (57.6 → 57.3 bpm). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles reveal markedly higher mean heart rate in the late afternoon/early evening in the current wave compared with the previous wave (notably 4–6pm: current ≈ 104.6 and 100.4 bpm vs. prior ≈ 85.3 and 88.8 bpm). Those afternoon/evening elevations could reflect greater physiological arousal or sustained activity in that period; the resting-RHR and most circadian change correlations with CES-D are small, so these physiological changes are suggestive but not definitive indicators of mood change by themselves.

Behavioral activities, health satisfaction, and social patterns:
Daily activities, exercise frequency, and substance-use behaviors were largely stable. Socializing and recreational habits show minimal change. However, global health satisfaction declined (4.78 → 3.89; Δ = −0.89), a moderate drop that, even with a small sample-level correlation to CES-D change (−0.15), is directionally consistent with worsening subjective well-being. Academic performance (GPA entries) are high and unchanged, and BMI is stable. Overall, lifestyle behaviors do not show large negative changes that would contradict the pattern from self-report affect measures; instead they are broadly stable while affective measures worsen.

Integrated interpretation regarding change in depressive burden:
Weighing the modalities together, the strongest and most directly relevant signals point toward increased depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. The large rise in trait anxiety (STAI) has a strong positive association with CES-D change in the sample and therefore provides the most powerful single indicator of CES-D worsening in this case. Modest increases in perceived stress and a decline in self-esteem further support that interpretation. Objective sleep quantity increased slightly (protective would be expected), but the large earlier shift in sleep timing—given its reported association with CES-D—aligns with worsening symptoms in this sample. Physiological data (stable resting HR, larger afternoon heart-rate peaks, increased circadian amplitude but slightly reduced day-to-day stability) offer mixed evidence; they do not contradict the self-report signals of increased arousal and distress but are insufficiently correlated with CES-D change to overturn the behavioral and affective indicators. The initial CES-D was high, and while regression-to-the-mean effects (indicated by the negative correlation of initial CES-D with change) could reduce scores on average in people with high baseline values, the contemporaneous pattern of increased anxiety and stress and decreased self-esteem and health satisfaction provide stronger individualized evidence of worsening.

Conclusion (direction of CES-D change):
Considering the balance of evidence across self-report, sleep, and wearable-derived physiology, the preponderance of change indicators (notably the large anxiety increase and accompanying stress and self-esteem trends) point toward an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

23576,-2.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report psychological state: The participant’s self-report profile shows mixed but overall favorable changes in affective indicators. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased modestly from 34 to 31 (Δ = −3; Z-score change small), and perceived stress decreased by 5 points (21 → 16). The participant reported a higher momentary happiness category (""pretty happy"" → ""very happy"") and increased satisfaction with physical health (5.22 → 5.67). These changes are directionally consistent with reduced short- to mid-term negative affect and lower distress. One notable negative change is a drop in self-esteem (Rosenberg score from 45 to 40; Δ = −5; Z-score of the change ≈ −0.9), which is a domain particularly relevant to depressive symptomatology and warrants consideration when integrating other signals.

Behavioral and social activity: Objective and self-reported activity patterns are mixed. Exercise frequency with others increased (from 1–2×/week to ≥3×/week) while solo exercise frequency remained high and stable; increased social exercise could provide protective social engagement. However, reported time socializing with friends declined (previously 1–2 hours → current ~31 minutes), and sedentary hobby time increased. Substance use remains absent across waves. Academic performance (GPA) is high and stable. Overall, behavioral activation indicators (increased group exercise, maintained overall exercise) point toward preserved or improved activity engagement, but the reduction in recreational social time and the fall in self-esteem temper a wholly positive behavioral interpretation.

Sleep statistics and subjective sleep control: Sleep shows modest decline in quantity with mixed indices of quality. Self-reported normal weekday sleep dropped from 7.0 to 6.0 hours (Δ = −1 hour), and Fitbit-derived median sleep duration moved from 7h46m to 7h28m (small decrease). Median sleep onset shifted later by ~13 minutes. Objective night-to-night variability remained low and essentially stable. Subjective sleep latency improved (30 → 15 minutes) but the participant reported feeling less control over their usual sleep amount. The pattern is one of slightly reduced sleep duration with modestly improved sleep initiation; reduced perceived control and lower habitual weekday sleep could contribute negatively to mood if sustained, but variability and sleep regularity do not show marked disruption.

Physiology and circadian rhythm: Cardiovascular and circadian markers align with modest reductions in physiological arousal and somewhat stronger circadian structure. Resting heart rate decreased from 57.5 to 55.6 bpm (Δ = −1.9 bpm), suggesting lowered baseline cardiac arousal. Nonparametric rhythm metrics show a small decline in interdaily stability and a marked reduction in intradaily variability (0.78 → 0.59), indicating fewer abrupt within-day transitions and a more consolidated daily pattern of activity/heart rate. Cosinor-derived MESOR and amplitude are largely stable to slightly increased amplitude, and acrophase shifted ~20 minutes earlier. Hourly aggregated heart rate values show expected daytime peaks and nighttime lowering; overall hourly profiles are consistent with the resting HR decrease. These physiological and circadian signals generally support improved autonomic/regulatory functioning or at minimum no degradation.

Integration and interpretation relative to CES-D change: Integrating domains, more indicators point toward stability or improvement in depressive burden than toward worsening. Decreases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, higher momentary happiness and health satisfaction, reduced resting heart rate, increased group exercise, and improved intradaily regularity are collectively consistent with reduced or stable depressive symptoms. Contrastingly, the notable decline in self-esteem, reduced reported weekday sleep duration, and decreased time socializing are risk-relevant signals that could promote increased depressive symptoms if they persist or deepen. The initial CES-D score is low (7/60; Z ≈ −0.66), leaving limited room for marked worsening; population-level correlations provided (e.g., strong positive correlation between STAI change and CES-D change) suggest the observed anxiety/stress reductions should predict lower CES-D, while the self-esteem decline would predict higher CES-D. On balance, the preponderance of affective, behavioral, physiological, and circadian indicators favors stability or a small improvement in depressive symptom burden rather than a clear increase.

Conclusion — directional assessment of CES-D change:
{
  ""cesd_direction"": ""stable_decrease""
}"
42137,-11.0,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological state and lifestyle:
Across self-report measures the participant shows several clear signals consistent with reduced affective burden. Trait anxiety on the STAI declined substantially (42 → 34; Z change ≈ -0.78) and perceived stress fell markedly (25 → 17; Z change ≈ -1.26), both changes that have moderately strong positive correlations with change in CES-D in this dataset (STAI delta corr = 0.72; stress delta corr = 0.25), meaning reductions in these measures tend to accompany reductions in CES-D. Self-esteem increased modestly (RSES 37 → 40; Z change ≈ 0.58; delta corr = -0.48), and the participant reported being “Very happy” now versus “pretty happy” previously (Z-change large, delta corr = -0.26), a pattern that also aligns with lower depressive symptom burden. Academic performance and physical health satisfaction are stable-to-improved (GPA steady/high; health satisfaction +0.22). Some behavioral shifts are mixed: socializing time and solitary exercise frequency are up or maintained (socializing 31 min → 1–2 hrs; exercising alone remains frequent), while recreational sedentary hobbies and TV time decreased. There is a small increase in occasional beer use (none → 1–2/month) and a small drop in trust ratings. Overall, the self-report profile points toward improved mood, lower anxiety/stress and greater self-esteem and social engagement, with a few modest adverse or neutral changes in trust, some recreational habits, and occasional alcohol use.

Paragraph 2 — Sleep behavior (self-report vs. wearable):
Sleep measures present a nuanced picture. Subjective “normal weekday sleep” decreased by one hour (7h → 6h), and the participant reports less perceived control over sleep amount (Somewhat Agree → Somewhat Disagree), both potentially negative signals. In contrast, objective Fitbit-derived sleep shows a small increase in median nightly duration (7h18m → 7h32m) and a meaningful reduction in night-to-night variability (SD 90min → 62min). Median sleep start time shifted only slightly later (~6 minutes), but start-time variability increased (more variable bedtimes). Reduced variability in duration and a small increase in median duration are typically favorable for mood regulation, whereas reduced subjective control and greater bedtime timing variability could offset some benefit. The net sleep signal therefore is mixed but leans mildly positive on objective consolidation and stability of total sleep time.

Paragraph 3 — Wearable physiology and circadian rhythm:
Cardiovascular indices and circadian rhythm features mostly reflect lower baseline physiological arousal and modestly stronger daily amplitude. Resting heart rate decreased from 51.8 to 48.6 bpm and the MESOR fell slightly (63.09 → 61.08), which together indicate lower average heart-rate level across days; hourly aggregated heart-rate values are lower at many hours compared with the prior recording. Amplitude increased (9.73 → 11.13) and acrophase shifted earlier (approximately 3:34 PM → 2:16 PM), suggesting a somewhat larger day–night range and earlier timing of the rhythm peak. Nonparametric circadian indices are mixed: interdaily stability declined (0.60 → 0.46), indicating somewhat less consistent day-to-day timing of activity/physiology, whereas intradaily variability also declined (0.77 → 0.60), indicating fewer rapid within-day transitions (less fragmentation). Autocorrelation at 24 h rose slightly. Taken together, these changes suggest lower tonic physiological arousal and an increase in rhythm amplitude, with improved within-day consolidation but reduced regularity across days. Those features (lower resting HR, greater amplitude, less intradaily fragmentation) are generally associated with better mood and recovery, while reduced interdaily stability could be a modest negative.

Paragraph 4 — Integrative interpretation and evidence for change in depressive burden:
When synthesizing modalities, the largest, most consistent signals point toward improvement in depressive symptom burden. Substantial reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress, increases in self-esteem and reported happiness, increased social time and stable exercise, and objective signs of lower resting heart rate and greater circadian amplitude form a coherent pattern that typically accompanies decreased depressive symptoms. Objective sleep consolidation (reduced variance and a slight increase in median duration) further supports this interpretation, despite the participant’s subjective report of shorter weekday sleep and reduced perceived control over sleep. Mixed signals that could indicate areas of concern include decreased interdaily stability of activity rhythms (less day-to-day schedule regularity), modest increases in occasional alcohol use, a small decline in trust scores, and greater variability in bedtime. The baseline CES-D was moderate (15/60) and the recorded correlations indicate that reductions in anxiety and increases in self-esteem and happiness are strongly associated with CES-D decreases in this sample (notably STAI delta corr = 0.72 and RSES delta corr = -0.48). Considering the weight and consistency of the multimodal improvements versus the few modest negative signals, the balance of evidence indicates a net decrease or stabilization at a lower level of depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

69057,-5.0,"Multimodal summary and salient directional changes:
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant shows a mixed pattern, with several indicators pointing toward reduced subjective stress and anxiety alongside notable declines in self-evaluative and social-trust domains and signs of changed substance use and circadian organization. Objective sleep duration and timing have shifted in a direction typically associated with improved sleep (longer median sleep and earlier bedtimes), while wearable circadian amplitude and mesor are lower and variability metrics show slight fragmentation. Taken together, these patterns suggest concurrent improvements in some arousal- and sleep-related contributors to mood symptoms but worsening in self-worth, interpersonal trust, and some health behaviors — producing a heterogeneous signal for depressive symptom burden.

Self-report affective, cognitive, and behavioral domains:
Trait anxiety (STAI) decreased modestly from 53 to 49 (Z-score change ≈ -0.27), and the perceived stress score declined substantially from 26 to 16 (Z-score delta ≈ -1.69), indicating a meaningful reduction in reported stress and trait anxiety compared with the prior wave. Health satisfaction increased slightly. In contrast, self-esteem on the Rosenberg scale dropped markedly from 35 to 27 (score delta -8, Z-score of delta ≈ -1.46), and generalized trust decreased (2.5 → 2.0, Z-score of delta ≈ -1.34). Recreational alcohol use increased from monthly to weekly for both beer and wine/liquor, and recreational drug usage increased modestly; exercise performed alone remained frequent while exercise with others declined. Socializing time was unchanged. These self-report changes indicate improvement in perceived stress/anxiety but deterioration in self-evaluation and interpersonal trust and modest increases in substance-related behaviors.

Sleep behavior — subjective and wearable concordance:
Subjective weekday sleep duration remained reported at 6 hours, while wearable-recorded median nightly sleep increased by ~33 minutes (from ~5 h 35 m to ~6 h 8 m; Z-score delta ≈ +0.5) and night-to-night variability in duration decreased (SD down by ~22 minutes). Median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 1 hour 18 minutes, with a modest increase in start-time variability. The combination of longer median sleep, earlier bedtimes, and reduced duration variability is consistent with improved sleep opportunity and greater consistency in total sleep time — factors that commonly relate to reductions in depressive symptom severity.

Physiology and circadian structure:
Resting heart rate remains low (42–43 bpm) with a small increase from 42.3 to 43.0 bpm; both values are low relative to the study population (Z-scores ≈ -1.9). Hourly aggregated heart-rate traces show lower nighttime heart rates and a re-distribution of daytime peaks relative to the prior wave. Cosinor-derived circadian measures indicate a reduction in amplitude (9.01 → 6.58) and a slight decrease in mesor, with acrophase shifting earlier (previously ~6:18 PM to ~2:24 PM). Interdaily stability is low and decreased slightly, and intradaily variability increased slightly. Reduced amplitude and lower circadian robustness can be associated with blunted physiological rhythmicity; this pattern, together with the earlier acrophase, suggests altered circadian organization despite improved sleep duration and timing.

Integration with depressive symptom implications:
Measures that typically covary with reductions in depressive symptom burden — notably large decreases in perceived stress and modest reductions in trait anxiety, plus objectively longer and earlier sleep with lower night-to-night duration variability — provide converging evidence for improvement in affective and sleep-related contributors to depressive symptoms. Conversely, a pronounced decline in self-esteem and reduced interpersonal trust, alongside increased alcohol use frequency and modest circadian amplitude attenuation, represent risk-relevant signals that might either counteract or reflect different symptom domains (e.g., interpersonal/positive-affect components) not fully captured by stress/anxiety indices. The initial CES-D score (12/60) was low at baseline; given the pattern of improved stress/anxiety and sleep but worsened self-esteem/trust and some behavioral risk factors, the net balance of evidence leans toward stability or modest improvement rather than a clear worsening of overall depressive symptom burden.

Conclusion — overall direction of change in CES-D burden:
Balancing the consistent and sizable reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety and the objectively improved sleep timing and duration against the substantial drop in self-esteem and reduced interpersonal trust, the preponderance of evidence supports a stable to modestly decreased depressive symptom burden compared with the prior wave rather than an increase.

64232,-1.0,"Multimodal self-report and behavioral data indicate several convergent improvements in subjective functioning and lifestyle. The participant reports a decrease in perceived stress (27 → 23; Z-score change ≈ -0.4) and an upward shift in subjective happiness (from ""pretty happy"" to ""Very happy"", Z-change 1.55). Self-esteem increased (37 → 39; Z-change ≈ 0.39) and satisfaction with physical health rose modestly (4.22 → 4.67; Z-change ≈ 0.36). Social and activity indicators show increased socializing (1–2 hours → 2–3 hours; Z-change ≈ 0.75) and more frequent exercise with others (monthly → 1–2 times per week; Z-change ≈ 1.0). Alcohol use by beer frequency declined (weekly → monthly; Z-change ≈ -1.23). Taken together, these subjective and behavioral changes point toward better mood-related functioning, greater social engagement, and modestly healthier habits.

Objective sleep metrics from the wearable corroborate improved and more regular sleep. Median sleep duration increased substantially (previous 8:00 → current 8:55; Z ≈ 1.85) while night-to-night variability dropped markedly (sleep duration SD 136 min → 52 min; Z-change ≈ -1.88). Sleep start times also became much more consistent (start time SD 150 min → 43 min; Z-change ≈ -2.11). These changes in both mean sleep duration and regularity are relatively large in magnitude and typically associate with better daytime functioning and lower depressive symptom burden in the literature.

Physiological circadian and heart-rate-derived metrics present a mixed picture. Heart-rate-based circadian amplitude decreased notably (12.25 → 8.36; Z-change ≈ -1.32) and interdaily stability declined (0.39 → 0.29; Z ≈ -1.38), while intradaily variability increased slightly (0.52 → 0.61; Z-change ≈ 0.42). Resting heart rate rose moderately (56.0 → 59.5 bpm; Z-change ≈ 0.78) and aggregated hourly heart rate shows higher evening peaks (notably 9–10 pm). These physiological changes suggest a weakening of the heart-rate circadian signal and somewhat greater within-day fragmentation or evening arousal despite the objective improvements in sleep timing and duration. The divergence between improved sleep regularity and reduced circadian heart-rate amplitude suggests that behavioral sleep consolidation has improved but overall daytime autonomic/circadian robustness (as captured by heart rate) is reduced.

Integrating these signals with the participant’s initial CES-D anchor (13/60, near the study mean) and the pattern of changes, the preponderance of evidence favors reduced depressive symptom burden. Subjective indices strongly point toward improvement: lower stress, greater happiness and self-esteem, increased social activity, and healthier substance use patterns. Objective sleep changes are robust and favorable (longer, more consistent sleep), which are influential correlates of lower depressive symptoms. Countervailing physiological signs (reduced heart-rate amplitude, lower interdaily stability, higher resting heart rate and evening HR peaks) indicate some deterioration in circadian/ autonomic regulation, but their magnitudes are smaller relative to the marked improvements in sleep regularity and self-report mood/function indices. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with an overall decrease or stabilization (improvement) in depressive burden rather than a worsening.

37404,0.0,"Multimodal self-report summary:
Compared with the prior wave, the participant reports a notable reduction in perceived stress (21 → 15; Delta = −6, Z-Score of Delta = −0.83), and a modest increase in global self-esteem (38 → 40; Delta = +2, Z-Score of Delta = 0.39). Trait anxiety (STAI) rose slightly (35 → 37) but remains in the non-anxious range; this change is small relative to scale range and prior classification. Subjective “happiness” is unchanged (“pretty happy”). In contrast, perceived overall physical health satisfaction declined substantially (4.44 → 2.78; Delta = −1.67, Z-Score of Delta = −1.59), indicating a meaningful drop in how the participant rates their health. Taken together, self-report measures include both signals consistent with lower affective burden (lower stress, slightly higher self-esteem) and signals that could reflect increased health-related concern or reduced well-being (marked drop in health satisfaction).

Wearable-derived physiological patterns:
Cardiovascular indices derived from the Fitbit show marked decreases in tonic arousal: resting heart rate declined from 64.6 to 58.4 bpm (Delta = −6.2 bpm; Z-Score of Delta = −1.27), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile is lower across many daytime and nighttime hours compared with the previous wave. Mesor (the fitted rhythm mean) also decreased (74.51 → 70.33; Delta ≈ −4.18), while amplitude is modestly larger. These changes in resting and mean heart rate are consistent with reduced physiological arousal or improved autonomic tone over the recording period. Circadian-regularity metrics provide a mixed picture: interdaily stability is low (current 0.19; Z = −2.24) and changed little, autocorrelation at 24h is low, and acrophase shifted earlier (previous ~7:04 PM → current ~4:08 PM). Intradaily variability decreased substantially (0.81 → 0.49; Delta = −0.32; Z-Score of Delta = −2.49), which suggests fewer rapid within-day transitions in heart rate but the overall circadian structure (interdaily stability and autocorrelation) remains weak. In sum, autonomic indicators point to lower overall physiological arousal, but circadian regularity across days is weakened.

Sleep quantity and timing:
Objective sleep duration increased modestly: median nightly sleep rose by about 23 minutes (7 h 9 m → 7 h 32 m; Z-Score of Delta = 0.31). However, night-to-night variability increased markedly: sleep duration SD increased from 66 to 181 minutes (Delta = +114 minutes; Z-Score of Delta = 2.81) and sleep start time SD increased from 65 to 168 minutes (Z-Score of Delta = 2.10). The median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 1 hour 12 minutes (00:48:47 → 00:01:34). These patterns indicate somewhat longer average sleep but substantially more irregular sleep timing and duration across nights. The large increases in variability suggest reduced stability of sleep schedules despite a small increase in total sleep.

Behavioral context and activities:
Several lifestyle changes are evident. Social recreational time appears to have fallen sharply (previously ~31 minutes per hour of socializing → “Do not do” now; Z-Score of Delta ≈ −2.11), and exercise frequency when done alone has decreased (from three times a week or more → 1–2 times a week); exercise with others remained similar. Alcohol use declined (beer and stronger drinks used less frequently). Sedentary hobby time increased slightly. These changes indicate reduced social interaction and lower solo exercise frequency alongside declines in substance use. The reduction in socializing is a prominent behavioral change that could relate to mood or to changes in schedule or priorities.

Integration and interpretation with respect to depressive symptom burden:
Several objective and subjective indicators point toward reduced affective arousal or lower affective burden: perceived stress fell substantially, resting heart rate and mean heart rate decreased notably, and self-esteem increased modestly. These changes are typically associated with reductions in depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. Conversely, increases in sleep schedule irregularity, a pronounced reduction in socializing, and a marked drop in health satisfaction are factors that often associate with greater depressive symptom burden or risk. Trait anxiety rose slightly but remains low. The initial CES-D score was low (7/60; Z = −0.66), indicating a low baseline burden and limited headroom for large increases; the reported correlation between initial CES-D and change is negative (−0.5), which suggests regression toward higher scores for lower initial scorers in the broader sample but does not itself assert change for this participant.

Holistic assessment and directional conclusion:
Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals are (1) a clear reduction in self-reported stress and (2) substantial decreases in physiological indices of arousal (resting and mean heart rate). These changes are supported by small increases in self-esteem and modestly longer average sleep. The principal contrary signals—marked increases in night-to-night sleep variability, a large decrease in self-rated health satisfaction, and a near-complete loss of reported socializing—are important and could indicate domains of functional decline that warrant monitoring. On balance, however, the dominant pattern across physiological and affective-report measures indicates decreased physiological and subjective stress and small improvements in self-concept, which point toward stable or reduced depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave rather than a clear worsening.

70492,-11.0,"Multimodal behavioral and psychological summary:
On self-report measures the participant shows several changes consistent with reduced psychological distress. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined substantially (49 → 39; Δ = −10, Z-Score Δ = −1.04), a change whose delta is strongly positively correlated with CES-D change in the dataset (Δ correlation = 0.72), meaning this large drop in anxiety is expected to accompany a decrease in depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress likewise fell markedly (25 → 15; Δ = −10, Z-Score Δ = −1.69), and global self-esteem increased (34 → 38; Δ = +4, Z-Score Δ = +0.76) — the self-esteem increase has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D change (Δ correlation = −0.48), indicating rises in self-esteem here are also associated with reductions in depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction increased, and subjective reports of feeling in control over sleep improved. These convergent self-report changes (lower anxiety and stress, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction) provide relatively strong evidence in favor of reduced depressive symptom burden since the previous wave.

Behavioral activity and social/leisure patterns:
Leisure and social activities generally decreased in duration (e.g., socializing 2–3 hrs → 1–2 hrs; listening to music 1–2 hrs → ≤15 min) and some passive recreational behaviors were reduced. Exercise frequency shows a small increase (some movement from “not at all” to “<1–2×/mo” or “1–2×/mo” categories). Alcohol use (wine/liquor) increased from monthly to weekly while beer use was stable; non-prescribed drug use decreased to none. The reduction in social/leisure time could be a potential risk factor for mood, but in this participant it co-occurs with marked decreases in anxiety and stress and improved self-esteem, so these behavioral shifts are mixed in their implications for depressive symptoms rather than decisively negative.

Sleep and circadian patterns:
Wearable and self-report sleep measures indicate more consistent timing but a small decrease in median sleep duration. Night-to-night variability and sleep-start-time variability both decreased substantially (sleep SD down from 222 to 140 minutes; start-time SD down from 138 to 51 minutes), suggesting greater regularity in sleep timing. Median sleep start time is slightly earlier (≈03:03 → 02:58) and median duration shows a modest reduction in this dataset. Self-reported normal weekday sleep remains low (5 hours) but perceived control over sleep increased. Correlations between sleep changes and CES-D change are small or mixed in direction; overall improved sleep regularity and greater perceived control are changes that more commonly align with mood improvement even if total sleep time is still short.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm metrics from wearables:
Heart-rate–based circadian summary metrics show an increase in MESOR (+8.19 bpm, Z-Score Δ = +2.02) and amplitude (+2.55 bpm), and resting heart rate rose by ~5.1 bpm (55.5 → 60.6). Aggregated hourly heart rates are higher across almost all hours in the current period versus the prior period. These changes indicate higher average cardiovascular activation across the day and night; however, correlations tying resting heart rate changes to CES-D change are very small in this dataset (Δ correlation ≈ 0.03). Nonparametric rhythm metrics are mixed: interdaily stability declined (0.45 → 0.36), suggesting somewhat less regular day-to-day rhythm, while intradaily variability decreased (0.70 → 0.61), indicating reduced within-day fragmentation. The wearable physiology pattern is therefore heterogeneous — increased mean heart rate could reflect increased daytime activity or autonomic tone, whereas reduced intraday fragmentation and reduced sleep variability support improved behavioral regularity. On balance, the physiological signals do not provide strong, consistent evidence of worsening depressive burden and are of limited magnitude in their association with CES-D change.

Evidence consistent with worsening or increased CES-D:
- Slight decreases in leisure/social time and reductions in listening to music could be interpreted as behavioral withdrawal, which can be associated with increases in depressive symptoms.
- Resting heart rate increased and overall MESOR increased; elevated resting heart rate can sometimes be associated with physiological stress or lower fitness. However, correlations of these physiologic changes with CES-D change are negligible in this dataset.
- A small number of sleep-change correlations (e.g., sleep-start time delta correlation = −0.4) could suggest complex associations, but the participant’s sleep became more regular and sleep-control perception improved.

Evidence consistent with improvement or stability/decrease in CES-D:
- Large and concordant reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress (both Δ = −10) are strongly suggestive of reduced depressive symptom burden, with the STAI change having a strong positive correlation to CES-D change (0.72) such that the observed anxiety reduction predicts CES-D reduction.
- Increased self-esteem and health satisfaction align with reductions in depressive symptoms (self-esteem Δ correlation = −0.48).
- Sleep regularity improved (reduced night-to-night and start-time variability) and perceived sleep control improved; these changes typically favor mood improvement.
- Many change correlations provided in the dataset either predict improvement with the observed deltas or are near zero (no evidence of a strong opposing association).

Holistic conclusion about direction of CES-D change:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the largest and most reliable signals point toward a reduction in affective burden since the prior wave. The substantial declines in trait anxiety and perceived stress combined with increased self-esteem and improved subjective health are the most salient indicators and are directionally consistent with a decrease in CES-D score. Physiological markers (higher MESOR/RHR) and reduced social/leisure time are mixed or potentially adverse signals but are either weakly correlated with CES-D change or small in explanatory weight relative to the prominent self-report improvements. Therefore, the overall balance of evidence supports that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has likely remained stable or decreased rather than increased.

95543,9.0,"Multimodal summary and framing:
The participant’s baseline CES-D score was extremely low (1/60, Z = -1.28), indicating almost no depressive symptom burden at the initial assessment; the baseline score also has a moderately negative correlation with subsequent CES-D change (r = -0.50), suggesting that lower initial scores are associated with greater upward change potential. Across the two-year interval, several self-report and wearable-derived signals changed in directions that, on balance, align with an increased risk for higher depressive symptomatology: a large rise in trait anxiety, reductions in self-esteem and health satisfaction, reductions in sleep quantity and circadian regularity, and declines in social/exercise engagement. A minority of measures (small drop in perceived stress score, small increase in interpersonal trust) moved favorably, but their magnitude is modest relative to the larger adverse changes described below.

Self-report psychological and lifestyle changes:
Trait anxiety increased markedly (STAI trait +19 points; Z-score delta = 2.68) and this STAI change has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change (Δ correlation = 0.72), making it a salient marker of likely increased depressive symptoms. Self-esteem declined (score -6, Z-score of delta = -1.09) and the delta correlates negatively with CES-D change (r ≈ -0.48), which is consistent with the expected association between falling self-worth and rising depressive symptoms. Subjective health satisfaction fell substantially (from 6.0 to 4.78, Z-score of delta ≈ -1.18), and the participant reports being “pretty happy” now versus “very happy” previously. Substance use remained negligible. Academic performance (GPA) stayed high and stable. Overall, the self-report pattern highlights rising anxiety and lower self-regard and health satisfaction—three constructs that commonly co-occur with increases in depressive burden.

Sleep, circadian, and physiological changes from wearables:
Objective sleep decreased meaningfully: median nightly sleep fell by about 1 hour 20 minutes (from ~7h25 to ~6h45) and sleep start times shifted later by ~30 minutes, with increased night-to-night variability. Circadian regularity measures show pronounced deterioration: interdaily stability dropped from 0.60 to 0.32 (Z-score of delta = -2.03) and amplitude from 12.81 to 6.4 (Z-score of delta = -2.17), indicating substantially weakened and less consistent daily heart rate rhythms. Resting heart rate rose slightly (+0.8 bpm) and aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show reduced amplitude of daytime/evening peaks versus the prior period, which together with amplitude loss suggests blunting of daily physiological rhythms. These changes (reduced sleep duration, later and more variable bedtimes, and loss of circadian structure) are physiologically and behaviorally consistent with an increased propensity for mood disturbance.

Activity and social behavior changes:
Social and physical activity decreased in frequency: exercising with others dropped from ≥3×/week to 1–2×/week and participation in sports diminished; time spent socializing remained similar, but leisure patterns shifted—watching TV decreased while time spent listening to music and sedentary hobbies increased. These changes indicate reduced group-based physical activity and an increase in solitary, sedentary leisure. The reduction in group exercise and sports participation is congruent with behavioral shifts that commonly accompany increases in depressive symptoms, and the large increase in time spent listening to music may reflect a compensatory or mood-regulatory behavior.

Weighing evidence for worsening versus stability/improvement:
Evidence supporting an increase in depressive symptoms: steep rise in trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D change), decline in self-esteem, reduced health satisfaction, decreased objective sleep quantity and stability, and marked loss of circadian amplitude/regularity—each of these changes is either directly correlated with CES-D change in the provided data or is a well-established risk correlate of increased depressive burden. Evidence supporting stability or improvement is limited and small in magnitude: stress score reduced by 1 point, interpersonal trust increased slightly, BMI unchanged, and GPA remained excellent. Given the large magnitude of the anxiety increase and the substantial deterioration in sleep and circadian organization—combined with reductions in self-esteem and group-based exercise—the preponderance of multimodal evidence points toward an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave, despite the very low initial CES-D anchoring the baseline.

Conclusion:
Considering the relative sizes of changes, the strong positive association between STAI change and CES-D change, and the pronounced objective deterioration in sleep and circadian metrics, the overall multimodal profile is most consistent with an increase in depressive symptom burden.

92566,1.0,"Multimodal trait and self-report summary:
Trait anxiety on the STAI increased from 24 to 29 (Δ = +5), moving the participant from an already low baseline toward a modestly higher anxiety level; the reported delta has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D change (r = 0.72), indicating that this rise in trait anxiety is a relatively strong predictor of an increase in depressive symptom burden. Global self‑esteem changed only slightly (48 → 49) and the self‑esteem delta correlates negatively with CES‑D change (r = −0.48), which would predict an improvement if weighted in isolation. Subjective happiness declined in wording from “very happy” to “pretty happy,” and perceived stress moved slightly down (18 → 17). The participant’s initial CES‑D score was very low (5/60; Z = −0.86) and that initial value is negatively correlated with subsequent change (r = −0.50), a pattern consistent with greater room for increase from a low baseline.

Sleep timing and duration:
Objective sleep timing shifted later and total sleep decreased. Median sleep start time moved substantially later (00:48 → 02:21; Δ ≈ +1 h 33 m), and median sleep duration declined (previously ~6 h 17 m to current ~5 h 48 m; wearable delta reported). Self‑reported usual weekday sleep also decreased (6.0 → 5.0 hours). Later bedtimes and shorter sleep are behaviorally consistent with increased eveningness and sleep restriction; however the provided correlation between change in median sleep start time and CES‑D change is negative (r = −0.41), and correlations for sleep duration were near zero, so the available associations do not strongly support either direction purely via these sleep metrics. Nevertheless, the magnitude of later sleep timing and reduced sleep opportunity is clinically relevant as a potential contributor to mood vulnerability.

Circadian structure and heart‑rate physiology:
Measures of circadian regularity derived from wearable data indicate clearer day‑to‑day structure: interdaily stability rose markedly (0.37 → 0.64; Z‑score of Δ = 2.04) and amplitude from cosinor analysis increased (9.31 → 14.69; Z‑score of Δ = 1.82). Autocorrelation at 24 hours also increased. These changes point to stronger, more regular heart‑rate circadian rhythmicity across the recording window. Resting heart rate remains low overall (49.7 → 51.8 bpm) with only a small positive delta; aggregated hourly heart‑rate profiles show higher daytime peaks and pronounced late‑evening elevation in the current epoch. The circadian regularity improvement is typically associated with better mood regulation, but the small correlations reported between these circadian deltas and CES‑D change are close to zero, indicating limited predictive weight in this dataset.

Behavioral activity and lifestyle:
Social and recreational patterns shifted modestly: in‑person socializing time decreased (2–3 h → 1–2 h weekday), internet use increased (16–30 min → 1–2 h), and frequency of beer consumption increased (monthly → weekly). Exercise frequency for solitary exercise remained stable at about three times per week. Trust ratings and health satisfaction increased slightly. Most lifestyle deltas have small correlations with CES‑D change (near zero), but the reduction in face‑to‑face social time combined with increased evening internet use and later sleep timing can be interpreted as behavioral changes that often accompany emerging mood symptoms when considered together.

Integration and directional assessment:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the most salient, high‑weight signal favoring an increase in depressive symptom burden is the rise in trait anxiety (STAI Δ = +5) coupled with its strong positive correlation with CES‑D change (r = 0.72). Additional supportive signals for worsening include a decline in subjective happiness, later and shorter sleep, reduced socializing, and small increases in BMI and late‑evening heart‑rate elevations. Offsetting signals that would point to stability or improvement include a small rise in self‑esteem (which correlates with CES‑D decreases), a modest reduction in perceived stress, and improved circadian interdaily stability and amplitude; however the correlations linking these latter changes to CES‑D change are small or inconsistent in direction in this dataset. Given the strong predictive weight of the STAI change and the participant’s low initial CES‑D (which statistically is associated with increases over time in this sample), the preponderance of evidence supports an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

67608,1.0,"Summary of self-report psychological measures and trends:
The participant’s baseline depressive symptom score (CES-D) was very low (1/0–60), providing a starting anchor of minimal reported depressive burden. In parallel, self-report measures broadly reflect stable-to-improving affective functioning: trait anxiety (STAI) decreased modestly (26 → 24), self-reported stress declined (21 → 18), and global health satisfaction increased (4.56 → 5.22). Self-esteem remained high and unchanged. Subjective positive affect (“Very happy”) was stable across waves. These changes in anxiety and stress are relevant because the STAI change shows a relatively strong positive correlation with change in CES-D (delta correlation = 0.72), indicating that the observed small reduction in anxiety would be expected to track with a reduction or maintenance of low depressive symptoms. It is also important to note that the initial CES-D score shows a moderate negative correlation with subsequent CES-D change (−0.5), which mathematically can reflect regression-to-the-mean effects; given the very low initial score, that statistical relationship suggests some potential for upward change in CES-D but does not by itself indicate clinical worsening.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology:
Wearable-recorded sleep and circadian metrics show a mixed pattern. Median nightly sleep duration decreased substantially (about 1 hour 19 minutes shorter than previously; 7h12 → 6h31) and night-to-night variability increased (sleep duration SD rose from ~58 to ~91 minutes). Sleep onset time was slightly later (~16 minutes), while reported sleep latency improved (18 → 5 minutes) and subjective perceived control over sleep increased modestly. In circadian/physiological indices, measures point toward stronger daily structure: interdaily stability rose (0.48 → 0.54), intradaily variability decreased (0.77 → 0.66), autocorrelation at 24 hours increased markedly, and cosinor amplitude increased (10.18 → 12.02) while mesor (mean heart rate) changed only slightly. Resting heart rate declined appreciably (53.6 → 49 bpm). Together, these wearable features suggest more regular, higher-amplitude heart-rate rhythmicity and lower basal cardiac arousal, which are commonly interpreted as markers of improved circadian consolidation or cardiovascular fitness. The pronounced reduction in total sleep time and increased variability are potential countervailing concerns, because shortened or inconsistent sleep can negatively affect mood; correlations provided for sleep change with CES-D change are small (e.g., median sleep delta correlation ≈ 0.11), so the net influence on depressive symptoms from sleep-specific change in this dataset appears modest but merits attention.

Behavioral, lifestyle, and activity context:
Behavioral reports show reductions in some potentially adverse behaviors (notably a reported drop in wine/liquor use from weekly to less-than-monthly) and decreased discretionary internet use (from 1–2 hours to ~31 minutes per day). Frequency of exercising alone remained high (≥3×/week), socializing minutes increased slightly, and participation in organized sports declined. These patterns — reduced alcohol consumption, sustained solitary exercise, and slightly more social contact — are consistent with behavioral changes that would be expected to support stable or improved mood. Fitbit-derived circadian improvements and lower resting heart rate further align with a pattern of improved behavioral regularity and possible increases in cardiovascular fitness or reduced physiological stress.

Integrated interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
When integrating self-report, behavioral, and physiological data, the balance of evidence favors stability or modest improvement in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Key supporting signals are the very low initial CES-D score, concomitant decreases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, increased health satisfaction, more regular and higher-amplitude circadian heart-rate rhythms, and a lower resting heart rate — all of which point toward maintained or improved affective and physiological functioning. Offsetting concerns include the notable reduction in objective nightly sleep duration and increased sleep variability, which are risk-relevant for mood; however, subjective sleep latency and perceived sleep control improved, and correlations between sleep change and CES-D change are small in magnitude. Considering the size and direction of the multiple indicators and their reported correlations with CES-D change, the preponderance of evidence suggests depressive symptom burden has not worsened and is most consistent with stable or decreased CES-D scores.

Conclusion — directional assessment:
Overall, the multimodal data indicate that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has remained stable or decreased rather than increased.

50766,-3.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological synthesis:
Across self-report measures and wearable-derived signals, the most pronounced changes between waves are in circadian organization and several psychosocial indices. Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a substantial loss of daily regularity and amplitude: interdaily stability fell from 0.68 to 0.37 (Z‑score delta ≈ -2.25), autocorrelation at 24 hours fell from 0.57 to 0.27 (Z‑score delta ≈ -2.13), and circadian amplitude decreased markedly (18.41 → 10.38, Z‑score delta ≈ -2.72). Mesor (mean level) shows a modest decrease while intradaily variability is essentially unchanged. These changes indicate a large reduction in the strength and day-to-day consistency of the participant’s heart-rate–based circadian rhythm.

Heart rate timing and hourly aggregation support a shift in physiological arousal timing rather than a uniform increase or decrease in cardiovascular tone. Resting heart rate remained stable (57.2 bpm), but aggregated hourly heart rate shows relatively lower daytime/afternoon peaks than previously and comparatively higher evening and late-evening heart rates (peaks around 6–11pm in the current data). The cosinor acrophase shifted slightly later (5:00 PM → 5:32 PM). Together with the loss of interdaily stability and amplitude, these patterns are consistent with circadian attenuation and a relative shift of physiological arousal toward later hours.

Self-report trait and behavioral measures present a mixed picture. Anxiety proneness (STAI-Trait) decreased modestly (37 → 35), a change that—given the positive correlation of STAI delta with CES‑D change reported in the dataset—would predict moving in the direction of lower depressive symptoms. However, self-esteem declined (Rosenberg 43 → 40), trust of others decreased slightly, and perceived stress increased (19 → 20). Health satisfaction and median sleep duration are essentially stable (sleep duration increased by ~8 minutes), but sleep timing moved slightly later (median sleep start delayed ~11 minutes) and sleep start time variability increased (standard deviation +21 minutes). Behavioral habits show increases in weekly wine/liquor use and a clear increase in time spent gaming; solitary exercise decreased to “not at all” while exercising with others remained frequent. BMI increased modestly.

Integration with CES‑D–relevant signals:
Several objective and subjective signals that commonly co-vary with depressive symptom burden moved in directions associated with increased burden. The large decreases in circadian amplitude and stability are biologically meaningful changes—reduced circadian robustness and a shift toward greater evening arousal have been linked in the literature to mood symptom worsening and poorer affective regulation. The participant also shows decreased self-esteem, decreased social trust, modestly increased perceived stress, a small rise in BMI, and increased alcohol frequency for wine/liquor; each of these changes individually aligns with greater risk for increased depressive symptoms. Sleep quantity remained stable, but later and more variable sleep timing can contribute to mood vulnerability, and the participant’s evening physiological elevation reinforces that risk.

Countervailing evidence for improvement or stability is limited but present. Trait anxiety decreased slightly, and self-reported overall health satisfaction and median sleep duration were stable. Resting heart rate remained steady, and some social behaviors (exercising with others, time socializing) were maintained. The magnitude of change in anxiety (small decrease) and stability of sleep duration temper but do not cancel the notable circadian destabilization and psychosocial declines.

Overall direction of change in depressive burden:
Evidence for worsening: large, objective reductions in circadian amplitude and stability, later and more variable sleep timing with increased evening physiological arousal, decreased self‑esteem and trust, modestly higher stress, increased alcohol use, and slight BMI increase. These factors together provide converging evidence consistent with an increase in depressive symptom burden.

Evidence for improvement/stability: small decrease in trait anxiety, stable sleep duration and health satisfaction, stable resting heart rate, and continued social exercise frequency—each of which would favor stable or lower depressive symptoms—but these changes are smaller in magnitude and fewer in number compared to the worsening signals.

Holistic conclusion: weighing the large magnitude of circadian disruption and multiple psychosocial indicators that moved in directions associated with greater depressive burden against the smaller, mitigating improvements, the balance of evidence favors an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

71089,-4.0,"Multimodal psychosocial summary:
The self-report battery shows several notable shifts in psychological functioning. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased from 46 to 40 (Δ = -6), a meaningful reduction in chronic anxiety proneness; the provided delta correlation (0.72) indicates this anxiety change is strongly associated with changes in CES-D in the sample and, given the direction here, would predict a concurrent decrease in depressive symptoms. Global self-esteem increased markedly (RSES 27 → 33, Δ = +6), a change of moderate-large size relative to the scale and with a negative delta correlation (-0.48) that is consistent with reductions in CES-D when self-esteem rises. Perceived overall health satisfaction also improved (2.33 → 3.44). Conversely, perceived stress rose modestly (19 → 21, Δ = +2), a smaller change whose delta correlation with CES-D is positive (0.26) and would point toward elevated depressive burden if taken alone. Taken together, self-report affective indices present a mixed but primarily favorable pattern: substantial decreases in anxiety and increases in self-esteem and health satisfaction counter a modest rise in stress.

Sleep (subjective and objective):
Sleep shows a clear pattern of later and shorter sleep. Objective median nightly sleep decreased by approximately 1 hour 14 minutes (from 8:12 to 7:26), and median sleep start time shifted later by ~50 minutes (00:50 → 01:41). Self-reported habitual weekday sleep likewise dropped (7 → 6 hours), and the participant’s sense of control over sleep declined (from “Somewhat Agree” to “Disagree”). Sleep timing variability increased slightly. The delta correlations for shorter/ later sleep timing provide mixed, generally small associations with CES-D change (median sleep start Δ correlation = -0.40, sleep duration Δ correlation ≈ 0.1), indicating that sleep deterioration is a relevant adverse signal but its statistical association with CES-D change in this dataset is modest. Clinically relevant sleep loss and later timing are risk factors for mood worsening and therefore represent an important countervailing influence in the profile.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian structure:
Cardiovascular and circadian metrics exhibit systematic change toward lower physiological activation and somewhat more regular daily structure. Resting heart rate fell from 71.2 to 66.4 bpm (Δ = -4.8 bpm). Aggregated hourly heart rate shows generally lower daytime peaks compared with the prior wave. Cosinor-derived mesor decreased (87.7 → 79.3), amplitude decreased slightly, interdaily stability increased (0.59 → 0.62) and intradaily variability decreased (0.50 → 0.46). These patterns—lower mean heart-rate levels, increased interdaily stability and reduced intradaily variability—are consistent with reduced baseline physiological arousal and slightly more regular circadian organization. Correlations of these wearable deltas with CES-D change are small in magnitude, but the direction of the physiological changes generally aligns with an improvement in affective burden rather than a worsening.

Behavioral habits and activity:
Daily activities shifted toward more sedentary leisure and increased alcohol use. Time in “sedentary hobby” increased substantially (from 1–2 hours to >4 hours), and frequency of beer/wine consumption moved from monthly to weekly. Exercise participation remained absent. Socializing and internet use were stable. These behavioral changes (greater sedentary time and increased alcohol frequency) are plausibly adverse for mood and could offset some of the psychosocial and physiological improvements; however, delta correlations linking these specific habit changes to CES-D change are small in magnitude in the provided data.

Evidence weighing for worsening (increase) in CES-D:
Signals that would support an increase in depressive burden include the objective reduction in nightly sleep duration (~1h14m), later sleep timing, reduced sense of control over sleep, increased sedentary leisure, and a small increase in perceived stress. Some of these changes have delta correlations with CES-D change in directions that would predict worsening (e.g., reduced sleep duration modestly associated with CES-D increase). These are nontrivial changes and represent plausible risk factors for mood deterioration.

Evidence weighing for improvement or stability (decrease/stable) in CES-D:
Stronger, clearer evidence supports a decrease or stability in depressive burden. Trait anxiety decreased substantially (STAI Δ = -6) and the STAI delta has a strong positive correlation (0.72) with CES-D change in the sample, meaning the observed reduction in anxiety strongly predicts a concurrent reduction in CES-D. Self-esteem rose considerably (RSES Δ = +6) and its negative delta correlation (-0.48) likewise predicts a CES-D decrease. Physiological indices (resting HR down ~5 bpm, lower mesor, increased interdaily stability, reduced intradaily variability) coherently indicate lower baseline arousal and slightly more regular circadian rhythms—physiological patterns more commonly associated with improved mood. Health satisfaction also improved. Moreover, the participant’s initial CES-D score (16/60) had a negative correlation with subsequent CES-D change (-0.5), suggesting some tendency for higher baseline scores to move toward improvement in this sample; the current psychosocial and physiological pattern is consistent with that tendency.

Holistic conclusion:
The profile is mixed: objective sleep loss and more sedentary behavior are notable negative signals, but they are outweighed by robust decreases in trait anxiety, a marked increase in self-esteem, improved self-rated health, and lower resting cardiovascular tone with improved circadian regularity. The strongest single statistical signal in the dataset linking change to CES-D is the STAI change (Δ correlation = 0.72), and the STAI change here favors a reduction in depressive symptoms. On balance—considering effect sizes and the relative strengths of the associations—the preponderance of evidence points toward a stable or decreased depressive symptom burden (i.e., an improvement or no meaningful worsening) relative to the previous wave.

22688,0.0,"Multimodal symptom and trait summary:
Relative to the prior wave, the participant’s self-report mood and trait measures show small but directionally mixed changes. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased from 27 to 30 (a modest rise; Z-score moved from −1.41 to −1.01), and self-reported happiness shifted downward in categorical terms from “very happy” to “pretty happy.” Rosenberg self‑esteem decreased slightly (46 → 44). In contrast, perceived stress fell (23 → 20) and trust and health satisfaction are unchanged or slightly improved. The participant’s initial CES‑D score was low (5/60, Z = −0.86); the provided correlation linking baseline CES‑D with future change (−0.5) suggests lower baseline scores are associated with subsequent upward change in this sample, so the low initial value tempers inference but does not rule out later worsening.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep:
Objective sleep showed a meaningful reduction in median nightly duration, from 8 h 2 min to 7 h 30 min (a decrease of ~1 h 28 min). Sleep start time moved earlier by ~1 h 29 min (median start 00:33 → 00:02), while night-to-night variability in start time and duration increased slightly. Subjective sleep measures (normal weekday sleep duration, ideal sleep, sleep latency, and sense of control over sleep) are essentially stable across waves (reported typical sleep remains ~6 hours on weekdays, desired 7 hours). The wearable-derived shortening of sleep duration is the most salient sleep change and is of sufficient magnitude to be behaviorally meaningful, even though the participant’s subjective sleep reports did not register a parallel change.

Circadian structure and heart-rate physiology:
Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced day-to-day regularity in the heart-rate signal. Autocorrelation at 24 hours declined substantially (0.28 → 0.09; Z‑score change large and negative), indicating weaker 24‑hour rhythmic persistence across recording days. Interdaily stability remains low and rose only slightly; intradaily variability increased modestly. Parametric cosinor measures show a lower MESOR (mean heart-rate level) from ~72 to ~66 bpm and a small rise in amplitude, and the acrophase shifted later by ~23 minutes. Resting heart rate decreased (~57.6 → 54.4 bpm), consistent with lower basal cardiovascular tone or improved fitness. Aggregated hourly heart‑rate profiles are broadly lower across much of the day compared with the previous wave, but there is a notable relative evening elevation (peak at ~7–8 pm increased). The combination of reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation and increased intradaily variability points to diminished circadian regularity despite a lower overall resting heart rate.

Daily activities and lifestyle:
Behavioral indicators show several positive changes: increased frequency of solo exercise (from none to 1–2 times/month) and maintained or increased participation in sports and group exercise (three times/week or more), and greater time socializing with friends (from ~30 minutes to 1–2 hours). Substance use patterns are stable. Screen- and sedentary-based recreation changed (video gaming decreased to none; sedentary hobby time rose), while listening to music increased. BMI and health satisfaction are unchanged. These activity changes (more exercise and more social interaction) are typically associated with better mood outcomes.

Synthesis and implications for depressive symptom burden:
Evidence is mixed but leans toward a modest worsening in depressive symptom burden. Indicators supporting increased depressive symptoms include the rise in trait anxiety, a decrease in self‑reported happiness and self‑esteem, a substantive reduction in objectively measured nightly sleep duration (~1.5 hours less), and a marked reduction in 24‑hour autocorrelation of heart rate indicating weakened circadian regularity—factors that are empirically associated with higher depressive symptoms. Conversely, decreased perceived stress, increased socializing and exercise, and a lower resting heart rate are changes that would more commonly predict stable or improved mood. Given the convergence on several mood‑relevant risk signals (sleep loss, circadian destabilization, increased trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem), and given the strong correlation provided between STAI change and CES‑D change, the balance of multimodal evidence suggests an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

38815,-9.0,"Paragraph 1 — Summary of depressive symptom anchor and self-report affective changes:
The participant’s initial CES-D score (11/60; Z = -0.24) places them below the study mean for depressive symptoms at the baseline wave. Accompanying self-report affect and trait measures show directional improvement on multiple affective indices: trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined substantially from 43 to 35 (Δ = -8), shifting the classification from “anxious” to “not anxious.” Perceived stress declined modestly (22 → 20), and global self-esteem increased slightly (RSES 38 → 39). Subjective happiness is described as “pretty happy” compared with “happy” previously (wording change is small). These self-report changes, particularly the large reduction in trait anxiety (a change that has a relatively high correlation with CES-D change in the dataset), point toward reduced negative affect and improved affective regulation compared to the prior wave.

Paragraph 2 — Sleep behavior: subjective and wearable-derived metrics:
Self-reported typical weekday sleep increased from 6 to 7 hours, indicating a shift toward the participant’s stated ideal (7 hours). Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration increased slightly (by ~5 minutes) and, more notably, night-to-night variability of sleep duration decreased markedly (sleep duration SD decreased from 136 min to 57 min). These changes indicate more consistent overall sleep quantity across days. In contrast, sleep timing shifted later (median sleep start moved from ~00:50 to ~01:45) and bedtime variability increased substantially (sleep start SD rose from 67 to 172 minutes), indicating more irregular bedtimes despite more regular total sleep. Taken together, the participant appears to have stabilized total nightly sleep but with a tendency toward later and more variable sleep timing.

Paragraph 3 — Circadian regularity and diurnal activity structure:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show some mixed but generally small improvements in rhythm regularity. Interdaily stability increased (0.33 → 0.41), and intradaily variability decreased slightly (0.60 → 0.58), suggesting marginally greater day-to-day consistency and slightly less within-day fragmentation of activity/heart-rate patterns. Autocorrelation at 24 hours declined (0.25 → 0.19), and cosinor-derived amplitude decreased (12.69 → 10.62) while MESOR increased modestly (67.27 → 69.35), indicating a reduction in circadian amplitude of heart-rate variation despite a slight upward shift in average level. These directional changes imply a modest loss of amplitude in the daily heart-rate rhythm, but small improvements in some measures of stability across days.

Paragraph 4 — Physiological arousal profile from heart-rate metrics:
Resting heart rate increased substantially (45.0 → 52.6 bpm; Δ = +7.6 bpm; Z-Score of Δ = +1.65). The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows higher mean values across multiple daytime and evening hours relative to the prior wave, with some redistribution of the largest peak hours. The marked increase in resting heart rate is a salient physiological change and may reflect altered autonomic balance, fitness changes, medication or illness effects, or other behavioral changes (e.g., increased evening activity or alcohol use). Correlations between resting heart-rate change and CES-D change in the dataset are small; nevertheless, the resting HR increase suggests elevated baseline physiological arousal relative to the prior recording period.

Paragraph 5 — Lifestyle, social, and behavioral indicators:
Exercise frequency when done alone remained frequent (three+ times per week), and participation in sports increased modestly. Social exercise decreased (exercising with others went to “not at all”), and time socializing with friends remained stable at ~1–2 hours. Alcohol consumption of beer increased (from 1–2 times/week to three times a week or more), while other substance and non-prescribed drug use remained absent. Time spent on the internet declined (3–4 hrs → 1–2 hrs) while listening to music and some recreational screen activities (video games) increased. Health satisfaction declined (5.67 → 4.67) despite some behavioral stability in solitary exercise. Overall, behavioral changes are mixed: increased solitary exercise and reduced internet use may be positive, but increased frequent beer consumption, reduced health satisfaction, and reduced social exercise are potential negative indicators.

Paragraph 6 — Integration and inference regarding change in depressive burden:
Weighing multimodal evidence, several strong indicators point toward a reduction or stability of depressive burden: a large decrease in trait anxiety (Δ STAI = -8) with a strong predictive correlation to CES-D change in the dataset, small declines in perceived stress, a small increase in self-esteem, and markedly reduced variability in nightly sleep duration and modest improvements in day-to-day circadian stability. These signals are consistent with reduced negative affective burden. Countervailing signals include a notable rise in resting heart rate, substantially later and more irregular sleep onset times, increased frequency of beer consumption, and decreased health satisfaction, each of which could reflect increases in physiological stress or health-related concerns. The physiological HR change is notable but its direct correlation with CES-D change here is minimal. On balance, subjective affect and several behavioral regularity measures show directionally stronger and more directly relevant improvement signals (particularly the STAI reduction, which is highly correlated with CES-D change in this dataset) than the adverse signals. Given the preponderance of affective and sleep-stability improvements and the magnitude of the STAI change, the evidence as a whole is more consistent with a stable or decreased depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

71193,-21.0,"Multimodal psychological profile — self-report measures:
Across the two measurement waves the participant reports large, clinically relevant improvements on several self-report indices that commonly covary with depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI) fell substantially (60 → 41; Delta = -19; Z-delta ≈ -2.2); this change has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D change (r = 0.71), indicating that the observed decrease in anxiety is tightly aligned with reductions in depressive symptoms in the study sample. Self‑esteem increased markedly (28 → 40; Delta = +12; Z-delta ≈ +2.24), and the delta correlation (r ≈ -0.47) implies that rising self‑esteem is associated with decreases in CES‑D scores. Perceived stress dropped notably (25 → 13; Delta = -12; Z-delta ≈ -2.12) and general happiness shifted upward in categorical terms (from “not so happy” to “pretty happy”); both changes point toward improved mood and reduced subjective distress. Health satisfaction also increased meaningfully. Taken together, the self-report changes form a coherent pattern consistent with reduced depressive burden relative to the prior wave.

Sleep — subjective and wearable-derived:
Subjective sleep reports and Fitbit-derived sleep metrics present a mixed but largely favorable pattern. The participant’s self‑reported normal weekday sleep increased (6 → 7 hours) and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep amount. The Fitbit median nightly sleep duration increased modestly (~25 minutes; now ~8 h 27 m) but with substantially greater night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD increased and sleep start time SD rose from ~41 to ~116 minutes). Median sleep start time moved earlier on average. In sum: average sleep quantity improved while temporal regularity worsened. Because improvements in sleep quantity and perceived control are often associated with reductions in depressive symptoms, the increased variability in sleep timing is a potential countervailing risk factor but does not offset the clear gains in duration and subjective sleep control evident in the self-reports.

Circadian and heart‑rate physiology:
Aggregate circadian rhythm metrics show reduced 24‑hour structure: interdaily stability decreased (0.72 → 0.52) and amplitude and mesor of the cosinor fit declined (amplitude ~14.6 → 11.4; mesor ~75.6 → 72.1). Intradaily variability increased modestly, indicating more fragmentation in the heart‑rate signal across the day. Resting heart rate changed only slightly (≈59 → 60.4 bpm). Hourly aggregated heart‑rate profiles show lower daytime peaks in the current recording compared with the previous wave, with somewhat lower nocturnal and early‑morning heart rates as well. Physiologically, these findings suggest a reduction in the strength and regularity of circadian cardiac rhythms despite an overall modest downshift in daytime arousal; such circadian weakening is typically associated with worse mood regulation, but the correlations between circadian deltas and CES‑D change are small in this dataset, so these physiological alterations should be viewed as supportive but not determinative signals.

Behavioral activity, social and substance use:
Behavioral indices show stability or improvement in adaptive domains. The participant reports no substance use in either wave. Recreational and social activities were largely stable, with modest increases in solitary reading and a cessation of exercising alone (exercise frequency declined), the latter representing a potentially negative behavioral change but with low correlation to CES‑D change in this sample. Academic performance variables shown are mixed across semesters but do not clearly map onto acute mood change here. Overall, lifestyle measures (reduced stress, increased health satisfaction, greater reported happiness and trust) align with the pattern of symptomatic improvement.

Synthesis and directional assessment of depressive burden:
Multiple high‑weight indicators converge on a reduction in depressive symptom burden. Large improvements in trait anxiety, self‑esteem, perceived stress, self‑reported happiness, and health satisfaction—all with moderate-to-strong correlations with CES‑D change—point toward a decrease in depressive symptoms since the prior wave. Objective sleep quantity increased and subjective sleep control improved, which also supports symptomatic improvement, although the increase in sleep timing variability and weakened circadian regularity are cautionary findings that could moderate long‑term recovery. Physiological heart‑rate metrics show reduced circadian amplitude and stability but only small correlations with CES‑D change in this dataset. Taking the pattern holistically, the preponderance of evidence (particularly robust self‑report improvements that are strongly associated with CES‑D change) indicates that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has decreased relative to the prior data collection.

71985,-8.0,"Multimodal self-report profile — The participant’s self-reported psychological measures show notable improvement on several proximal indicators of affective risk. Trait anxiety (STAI) declined from 41 to 36 (score delta -5), shifting the classification from “anxious” to “not anxious”; this change has a relatively large positive correlation with CES-D change in the dataset (delta correlation = 0.72), consistent with a linked reduction in depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem increased from 34 to 38 (delta +4), a meaningful upward move on the Rosenberg scale with a delta correlation that is compatible with concurrent reductions in CES-D (delta correlation = -0.48). Perceived stress decreased (23 → 19) and health satisfaction increased slightly. Substance use remained negligible and social recreational time was largely unchanged. These self-report changes collectively indicate improved subjective emotional functioning and self-regard relative to the prior wave.

Sleep behavior (subjective and wearable) — Subjective sleep latency remained short and unchanged, but habitual sleep duration reported and recorded both declined markedly: normal weekday self-reported sleep decreased from 7.5 to 6.0 hours, and median Fitbit sleep duration fell by about 1 hour 25 minutes (from ~7h18m to ~6h43m). The participant’s median sleep start time shifted later by approximately two hours (00:21 → 02:21), while night-to-night variability in sleep onset and duration actually decreased (standard deviation of sleep duration fell from 108 to 63 minutes and sleep start SD decreased). These patterns describe a later, shorter, but more internally consistent sleep schedule. Because shorter total sleep is a known correlate of worse mood, the objective reduction in duration is a substantive counterpoint to the self-reported emotional improvements.

Circadian and physiological metrics — Wearable-derived circadian structure shows mixed signals. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation both declined (interdaily stability 0.69 → 0.52; autocorrelation 0.56 → 0.45), indicating reduced day-to-day regularity in activity/heart-rate rhythm across the recording period despite reduced night-to-night variance in sleep timing. Intradaily variability remained essentially unchanged. Resting heart rate increased only slightly (50.2 → 50.8 bpm). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show higher mean heart rates across many late-night and daytime hours in the current period relative to the previous period (notably in late evening/night windows), which may reflect greater physiological activation during those hours or differences in activity/sleep timing. Cosinor parameters (mesor and amplitude) are essentially stable with only small changes. Overall, the circadian indices point to reduced inter-day regularity of the heart-rate/activity rhythm and modestly elevated heart-rate levels at several time windows.

Behavioral activity and lifestyle — Objective and reported activity levels changed towards lower social and organized exercise: frequency of exercising alone decreased (three times/week or more → 1–2 times/week) and exercising with others declined to none. Recreational media use shifted slightly toward more video game time (1–2h → 2–3h). BMI rose slightly (+0.31). Trust scores decreased modestly. These behavioral shifts reflect reduced physical activity and some reduction in social exercise contexts, which are behaviors that can buffer mood; their decline could limit mood improvement or contribute risk despite improvements in subjective affect and self-esteem.

Synthesis and direction of change in depressive burden — There are competing signals. Strong, concordant self-report improvements in trait anxiety, self-esteem, and perceived stress weigh in favor of reduced depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. In contrast, objective sleep quantity decreased substantially and circadian regularity at the day-to-day level declined—both changes that often portend worse mood outcomes. Exercise frequency also decreased, which could blunt longer-term mood gains. Considering magnitude and relevance, the largest and most consistent changes in psychological domains (notably the sizable drop in trait anxiety and rise in self-esteem) are closely related to CES-D fluctuations and are supported by high delta correlations in the dataset. The objective sleep reduction and reduced interdaily stability are important risk signals but appear to be lower in coherence with the observed self-report improvements. Taking the multimodal evidence together, the balance of change favors an overall reduction in depressive symptom burden compared with the prior collection wave.

98117,0.0,"Multimodal psychological profile — self-report: The participant’s trait anxiety increased markedly between waves (STAI trait: 53 → 66; +13 points, large positive Z-change), indicating substantially greater chronic anxiety proneness. Concurrently, global self-esteem declined substantially (RSES: 32 → 19; −13 points, a large negative Z-change). Self-report of subjective affect also shifted in a negative direction: the participant moved from “not so happy” to “not happy at all,” and perceived stress rose modestly (22 → 24). Health satisfaction improved modestly, but this small positive change is outweighed in magnitude and relevance by the large increases in anxiety and the large drop in self-esteem. Notably, the change in STAI is strongly positively correlated with CES-D change (delta correlation ≈ 0.72), and the decrease in self-esteem is negatively correlated with CES-D change (≈ −0.48), which together indicate that these large self-report shifts are likely to be associated with increases in depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral habits and social activity: Several behavioral signals are mixed. The participant reports reduced internet time (from >4 hours to 1–2 hours) and a small increase in exercising alone (from none to <1–2 times/month), both changes that could reflect behavioral regulation. However, sedentary hobby time increased substantially (from 16–30 minutes to 2–3 hours), and socializing remained minimal (≤15 minutes). Substance use remains absent. The pattern is therefore one of reduced some forms of passive screen time but increased overall sedentary leisure and persistently low social engagement; given the concurrent rises in anxiety and fall in self-esteem, these behavioral shifts more likely co-occur with, or reflect, worsening mood rather than recovery.

Sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures show improvements in timing regularity but continued short sleep. Median nightly sleep from the wearable is in the short-sleep range (≈6 h 16 min, Z ≈ −1.22) and has decreased modestly relative to the prior wave; however, sleep timing became earlier and substantially more regular (median sleep start earlier; sleep start SD fell markedly, and sleep duration SD decreased), indicating reduced night-to-night variability. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show stronger organization: interdaily stability increased substantially (0.27 → 0.60), autocorrelation at 24h rose, and amplitude increased—together indicating a more stable, higher-amplitude circadian pattern. Resting heart rate is essentially unchanged (small decrease 67.2 → 66.4). These objective improvements in circadian regularity and timing variability are generally associated with better behavioral regularity and can, in many contexts, mitigate depressive symptoms; however, in this case they coexist with worsening self-reported affect and trait anxiety.

Hourly and diurnal physiology: Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles indicate lower early-morning heart rates and relatively higher afternoon-evening peaks in the current wave compared with the previous wave. Afternoon and evening hours (roughly 12–9 pm) show elevated mean heart rates relative to the earlier wave, suggesting greater daytime/evening physiological activation or arousal during waking hours. Resting heart rate is little changed. The pattern of higher daytime/evening heart rates combined with higher trait anxiety may reflect increased autonomic arousal during waking hours, which plausibly supports an interpretation of heightened internal stress or affective activation.

Integration and interpretation: The dataset presents a mixed signal, but the most salient and sizeable changes point toward increased affective burden. The very large increases in trait anxiety and the large decline in self-esteem are both strong, proximal psychological indicators that correlate with increases in CES-D in this sample (STAI delta correlation ~0.72; self-esteem delta correlation ~−0.48). Self-reported affect worsened (happiness decreased) and sedentary leisure increased while social engagement remained minimal. Objective wearable measures provide evidence of improved circadian regularity and reduced night-to-night variability—potentially protective behavioral changes—but these objective improvements are smaller in magnitude relative to the pronounced negative shifts in core self-reported affective traits. The initial CES-D score was high (33/60) and its negative correlation with change suggests possible regression toward lower scores for those initially high; despite that, the convergent, large-magnitude self-report changes (anxiety up, self-esteem down, subjective happiness down) outweigh the protective signals from circadian metrics and point toward an overall increase in depressive symptom burden since the prior wave.

Conclusion: Considering the strong increases in trait anxiety, the pronounced decline in self-esteem, worsening subjective happiness and increased sedentary behavior—despite some objectively improved circadian regularity—the preponderance of evidence supports an overall increase in depressive symptom burden (worsening CES-D).

24883,-2.0,"Multimodal self-report summary — psychological traits, behavior, and subjective sleep:
The participant’s trait-level anxiety (STAI–Trait) has decreased modestly (42 → 40), and self-esteem shows a small increase (49 → 50). Both of these changes are directionally associated with reductions in depressive symptoms in the provided delta correlations (STAI delta correlation = 0.72; Self-Esteem delta correlation = -0.48), suggesting some psychological signs of improvement. However, concurrent self-reported lifestyle and wellbeing indicators moved in the opposite direction: perceived health satisfaction declined (3.33 → 2.67), perceived stress increased (23 → 26), and social/leisure engagement and solo exercise decreased (exercise “Not at all” now vs some prior activity). Importantly, subjective weekday sleep collapsed (normal weekday sleep 5 → 4 hours; desired sleep dropped 7 → 6 hours) and the participant reports less control over sleep. Where correlations are available, increased stress and decreased health satisfaction are aligned with increases in CES-D in the provided correlation directions, while the small improvements in anxiety and self-esteem would predict decreases. Overall, self-report contains mixed signals but shows meaningful deterioration in sleep, physical-health satisfaction, stress, and behavioral engagement despite small improvements in trait anxiety and self-esteem.

Wearable-derived sleep, circadian, and cardiovascular patterns:
Objective sleep from the wearable indicates a notable decline in sleep quantity and stability. Median sleep duration fell by about 1 hour 19 minutes (previous 6h53m → current 6h12m) and night-to-night variability increased substantially (SD 88 → 154 minutes). Sleep start-time variability also rose markedly. These changes (reduced duration and greater irregularity) typically track with worsened depressive symptoms in the literature and are flagged in the dataset with non-trivial delta correlations for variability metrics. Circadian rhythm summaries show modest increases in interdaily stability and small increases in mesor and amplitude, with an earlier acrophase (~7:07 PM → ~6:01 PM). Resting heart rate rose from ~50.6 to ~53.6 bpm. The hourly aggregated heart-rate profile shows some shifts in daytime/evening elevations compared with the prior period (notably larger afternoon-evening peaks in the current aggregate), consistent with altered autonomic activation patterns; however, the correlations of these cardiovascular deltas with CES-D change are small in magnitude. Taken together, the wearable data point chiefly to worsened sleep quantity and stability and modest physiological activation changes rather than a clear physiological signature of improvement.

Integration and interpretation with respect to change in depressive burden:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, there is a pattern of behavioral and sleep deterioration that is plausibly linked to an increase in depressive symptom burden. The largest and most consistent negative changes are reduced and more irregular sleep, decreased physical/social activity, lower health satisfaction, and increased perceived stress — all of which are either directly associated with CES-D increases in the supplied correlations or are known to co-occur with worsening mood. Countervailing signals (small improvements in trait anxiety and self-esteem, and increased trust) are present but small in magnitude relative to the sleep and behavioral declines. The participant’s baseline CES-D was low (9/60), and the baseline correlation with change is negative (higher baseline associated with subsequent decrease), which provides context but does not offset the sizable objective and subjective deterioration in sleep and daily functioning observed here. On balance, the preponderance of evidence — particularly large declines in sleep duration and stability, reduced exercise/social engagement, increased stress, and decreased health satisfaction — supports an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

66815,-6.0,"Multimodal behavioral and self-report synthesis:
Across self-report measures the participant shows a pattern of reduced anxiety and modestly reduced perceived stress alongside stable self-esteem and a notable increase in satisfaction with physical health. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased from 41 to 37 (Z-change ~ -0.27), a change that is both clinically meaningful in direction and statistically positioned in this sample to be strongly associated with reductions in depressive symptoms (STAI delta correlation = 0.72). Perceived stress fell slightly (22 → 20) and self-esteem remained stable at a relatively high level. Conversely, a single-item global happiness descriptor declined from “very happy” to “pretty happy” (Z-change large negative), which constitutes a countervailing subjective signal of reduced positive affect. Overall, the self-report domain yields primarily adaptive signal (less anxiety, lower stress, higher health satisfaction), with one notable negative shift in hedonic wording.

Behavioral lifestyle changes:
Health-related behaviors shifted toward greater regular physical activity and somewhat increased social/leisure engagement. The participant reports exercising alone three or more times per week (up from very infrequent), maintaining team/sports activity at a moderate level, and reporting small increases in time spent socializing, reading and listening to music. Alcohol use moved from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month,” and recreational/non-prescribed drug use remained absent. Internet time increased. The exercise increases and greater social/leisure engagement are consistent with behavioral patterns that typically support improved mood; the modest increase in alcohol use is a potential risk signal but small in magnitude.

Sleep timing, circadian structure and cardiovascular physiology:
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics show several notable, largely positive shifts. Median nightly sleep duration increased slightly (~9 minutes) and variability remained low; most strikingly, median sleep start time advanced earlier by ~2 hours (from ~01:49 to ~23:49), a large phase-advance (Z-change ≈ -2.28). Non-parametric rhythm measures (interdaily stability up slightly, intradaily variability slightly down) and a substantial rise in 24-hour autocorrelation indicate more stable day-to-day structure. Cosinor-derived amplitude increased (15.97 → 18.2) while mesor remained stable at a relatively low population-relative level; acrophase shifted markedly earlier (5:32 PM → 1:18 PM), consistent with the earlier sleep timing. Resting heart rate decreased from 46.0 to 43.4 bpm, consistent with improved cardiovascular fitness or autonomic tone. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles reflect lower nocturnal rates and a more pronounced diurnal amplitude. Taken together, these changes indicate stronger, earlier-aligned circadian organization and modestly improved physiological recovery at rest.

Integration and interpretation with respect to CES‑D change:
Multiple independent signals point toward a reduction or stabilization of depressive symptom burden. The largest prognostic signals in the dataset that are empirically associated with CES‑D change are the reduction in trait anxiety (STAI) and the marked advance and stabilization of sleep timing/circadian rhythm; both of these shifts are correlated in this sample with decreases in CES‑D. Additional supporting evidence includes a small drop in perceived stress, increased exercise frequency, improved health satisfaction, increased circadian regularity (autocorrelation and interdaily stability), increased amplitude, and a lower resting heart rate. Conflicting signals are limited: the decline in a single-item happiness descriptor and modest increases in alcohol and internet use are adverse signals but are smaller in overall magnitude and less consistently correlated with CES‑D change in the provided data. The participant’s baseline CES‑D was low (11/60), and the initial-score correlation with change (−0.5) suggests regression toward lower variability from that baseline; however, the convergent multimodal pattern (less anxiety and stress, earlier/more regular sleep, more exercise, better health satisfaction, improved autonomic markers) collectively favors a decrease or stability at a lower level of depressive symptoms rather than worsening.

Conclusion:
On balance, the multimodal evidence indicates that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not wors and is more consistent with stability or modest improvement. The strongest supporting evidence is decreased trait anxiety and improved circadian/sleep timing and physiological markers; the main negative signal is a self-rated reduction in happiness that is outweighed by multiple corroborating objective and trait-level improvements.

14847,16.0,"Multimodal summary — affective and self-evaluative measures:
The most pronounced change in self-report affective measures is an increase in trait anxiety (STAI) from 50 to 60 (Z-score change +1.53), a large and clinically meaningful rise that the dataset flags as strongly positively correlated with increases in CES-D (delta correlation = 0.72). Perceived stress also rose from 24 to 30 (Z-score now 2.53, Z-change +1.76), a notable increase consistent with elevated momentary and chronic stress exposure; this change shows a modest positive association with CES-D change (delta correlation = 0.25). In contrast, global self-esteem increased from 35 to 38 (small-to-moderate improvement; Z-change 0.58), and prior CES-D score was relatively elevated (24/60, Z = 1.11) with a moderate negative correlation with subsequent CES-D change (−0.50), which could bias toward improvement over time. Taken together, the large increases in anxiety and stress are indicators that push in the direction of worsening depressive symptom burden, while the modest gain in self-esteem is a countervailing factor that would be expected to reduce depressive symptoms if it is sustained.

Behavioral and social activity patterns:
There are clear reductions in several behavioral activities that are typically relevant to mood. Exercise frequency shows a marked drop (previously “three times a week or more” to current “1–2 times a month”; Z-change ≈ −1.65), and time spent socializing and listening to music both decreased substantially (listening to music decreased from ~2–3 hours to ≤15 minutes; socializing similarly shows large declines). Recreational screen time patterns changed (internet use slightly increased), but overall daily recreation and social engagement appear reduced. These reductions in physical activity and social engagement are well-aligned with risk for increased depressive symptoms; the dataset’s delta correlations for these specific behavior changes are small or mixed, but their magnitude and direction are clinically meaningful as potential contributors to poorer mood.

Sleep and circadian physiology:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show a substantive improvement in sleep quantity and regularity: median nightly sleep increased by approximately 1.5 hours (from 6 h 38 m to 8 h 8 m; Z-change +1.62), sleep onset time shifted earlier (~02:24 → 02:05) and variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time decreased. Subjective sleep latency also improved (45 → 20 minutes) and the participant reported greater perceived control over sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show increased interdaily stability (0.33 → 0.46) and decreased intradaily variability (0.95 → 0.68), indicating a more regular and less fragmented day–night structure. These objective sleep and circadian changes are classically protective against depressive symptoms and, if sustained, would be expected to promote mood improvement. The dataset, however, reports only small correlations between these sleep/circadian deltas and CES-D change (mostly near 0), so their predictive weight for CES-D change in this sample appears limited but directionally positive.

Cardiovascular and physiological patterns:
Resting heart rate is nearly unchanged (58.1 → 58.7 bpm), mesor decreased modestly (75.6 → 70.2), and amplitude increased slightly, yielding a heart-rate rhythm with marginally lower average and greater daily amplitude. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show lower nocturnal and some daytime values compared with the prior wave. Overall, these physiological changes do not indicate heightened autonomic arousal at rest and are broadly neutral-to-favorable for mood—consistent with improved sleep and circadian regularity—but correlations of these physiological deltas with CES-D change are small in the provided data.

Integrative interpretation and likely direction of CES-D change:
Competing domains are evident. Strong signals that typically predict worsening depressive symptoms include a large rise in trait anxiety (STAI +10, high delta correlation 0.72), a notable increase in perceived stress, and substantial decreases in physical activity and social engagement. Protective signals include a fairly large improvement in objective sleep duration and regularity, improved circadian stability, a small increase in self-esteem, and largely stable resting cardiovascular indices. Given the relative magnitudes and predictive correlations provided, the increases in anxiety and stress—particularly the STAI increase which has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change—carry greater weight than the protective sleep/circadian improvements and modest self-esteem gain. The behavioral reductions in exercise and social contact further bias toward worsening mood. On balance, the multimodal pattern is more consistent with an overall increase in depressive symptom burden between waves than with stability or improvement.

99733,0.0,"Multimodal behavioral and self-report synthesis
The self-report profile shows a pattern of clear improvements in psychological well-being and health-related behaviors between waves. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased slightly (31 → 30; Z-change small), self-esteem increased (33 → 34), and self-rated stress fell (18 → 15). Affect labels shifted upward (from “pretty happy” to “Happy”) and health satisfaction rose by one point on a 1–7 scale (5 → 6). Trust in others increased substantially (Δ = +1.17, Z-change high), and time spent socializing increased modestly. These changes are large enough in several domains (notably trust and self-reported sleep duration) that they are unlikely to reflect only measurement noise. On balance, the self-report evidence indicates improved mood, greater perceived control of sleep, better perceived physical health, and increased social connectedness—all behavioral correlates typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian behavior
Objective sleep and circadian metrics from the wearable also indicate directional improvements in sleep quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep duration increased markedly (≈6h43m → 8h05m; Δ ≈ +1h22m; Z-change large) and night-to-night variability in duration fell (SD 86m → 47m). Median sleep start time shifted earlier by ~1h27m and became more regular (start-time SD decreased), consistent with a more consolidated and stable sleep schedule. Non-parametric and cosinor circadian features derived from heart rate show increased interdaily stability (0.42 → 0.60) and higher autocorrelation at 24 hours, indicating a stronger day-to-day regularity in resting-state physiology. These changes—longer, more regular sleep and greater circadian stability—are generally associated with improved mood regulation and reduced depressive symptoms.

Physiological activity patterns and cautionary signals
Physiological signals present a mixed picture. Resting heart rate increased moderately (~61.3 → 65.4 bpm) and the MESOR rose slightly, while amplitude increased modestly; hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show higher daytime means at several afternoon hours. However, the correlations between changes in most heart-rate/circadian metrics and CES-D change in this dataset are small (near zero), suggesting limited predictive weight of these physiological fluctuations for depressive symptom change in this sample. The rise in resting heart rate is noteworthy but small-to-moderate in magnitude; without concurrent adverse self-report signals (e.g., increased anxiety or stress), the physiological rise alone provides only weak evidence for worsening mood.

Mapping multimodal change to CES-D direction
When mapped to the dataset’s reported correlations between metric changes and CES-D change, the majority of observed directional changes favor reduction or stability of depressive symptoms. Improvements likely to predict CES-D decreases include lower trait anxiety (STAI Δ = -1; Δ–CESD corr = +0.72, so a decrease in STAI predicts a decrease in CES-D), increased self-esteem (Δ corr = -0.48), reduced stress (Δ corr = +0.26; stress decreased), earlier and more consistent sleep timing (sleep start Δ corr = -0.40; earlier sleep associated with CES-D decrease), increased socializing and happiness (small negative correlations), and higher health satisfaction (Δ corr = -0.15). A minority of signals either weakly point toward increased CES-D or are neutral: total sleep duration increased (Δ corr ≈ 0.11 small positive), interdaily stability increased (Δ corr ≈ 0.07 small positive), and resting heart rate rose (Δ corr ≈ 0.02 negligible). Importantly, the participant’s baseline CES-D was very low (5/60). The dataset notes a negative correlation between initial CES-D and change (corr = -0.5), indicating that individuals with lower initial scores in this cohort tended to show increases over time (a statistical tendency toward regression to the mean). That statistical tendency is a competing influence: although many behavioral indicators moved in a direction associated with reduced depressive burden, the participant’s low baseline value increases the prior probability of some upward change.

Holistic assessment and conclusion
Balancing the evidence, most of the multimodal signals—improved affect, lower anxiety and stress, higher self-esteem, greater trust and social time, longer and more regular sleep, and stronger circadian regularity—converge on a direction consistent with stable or reduced depressive symptom burden. Physiological changes (slightly higher resting heart rate and modest MESOR increase) and the baseline-statistics caveat (low initial CES-D correlates with later increases) provide limited counterevidence but are either small in magnitude or of moderate predictive influence. Overall, the preponderance and magnitude of change across psychological self-report and objective sleep/circadian measures indicate that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not worsened and is more consistent with stability or improvement.

27407,-1.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological summary:
Wearable-recorded sleep duration shows a small but consistent upward shift: median nightly sleep increased by approximately 19 minutes (from ~6 h 14 m to ~6 h 34 m; Z-score change ~0.23), and the standard deviation of sleep duration decreased modestly (120 → 107 minutes), indicating a slight reduction in night-to-night variability of total sleep time. However, sleep timing shifted later: median sleep onset moved later by ~42 minutes (from ~02:02 to ~02:45) with greater variability in sleep start times (SD increased from 51 to 69 minutes). Circadian and activity-rhythm indices indicate reduced 24-hour regularity and greater within-day fragmentation: interdaily stability decreased slightly (0.44 → 0.42) and intradaily variability rose notably (0.51 → 0.66; Z-score of the delta ≈ 0.84), while autocorrelation at 24h declined (0.34 → 0.27). Heart-rate–derived circadian magnitude (mesor) increased modestly (64.55 → 67.11) while amplitude decreased (11.74 → 10.93). Resting heart rate remains low in absolute terms but rose slightly (47.1 → 48.2 bpm). Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show modest re-distribution of daytime and nighttime heart rates relative to the previous wave, consistent with later sleep timing and somewhat altered daily activity/physiological patterns.

Self-report psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle changes:
On self-report measures, trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) is high relative to the sample and changed only minimally (50 → 49). Perceived stress increased modestly (23 → 24; Z-score change ~0.68), and health satisfaction declined slightly. Self-esteem is unchanged. Behavioral habit changes include increased solitary exercise frequency (from 1–2×/week to ≥3×/week), decreased exercise with others, increased frequency of beer consumption (from monthly to weekly) and a small uptake of wine/liquor use, and reduced time spent reading. Socializing time is reported as stable. Subjective sleep latency and desired sleep amount are unchanged, while self-reported normal weekday sleep increased by about 30 minutes (5.5 → 6.0 hours), consistent with the wearable increase in median sleep duration. Overall, the participant reports remaining “Happy” and shows stable academic performance (GPAs) and self-esteem, but reports slightly higher stress and some increased alcohol use alongside reduced social exercise.

Evidence consistent with increased depressive symptom burden:
Multiple indicators point toward incremental worsening in circadian regularity and daily structure—specifically, the rise in intradaily variability and the decline in interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation—changes that are often associated with greater mood symptomatology. The small increase in self-reported stress, the decline in health satisfaction, later and more variable sleep timing (despite a small increase in total sleep time), and increases in alcohol use are all behavioral signals that commonly co-occur with worsening depressive symptoms. The decrease in exercise with others and reduction in recreational reading time suggest slight reductions in some social and rewarding activities. Collectively, these changes indicate a modest shift toward patterns that are typically linked with increased depressive burden.

Evidence consistent with stability or improvement:
Countervailing data include a modest objective and subjective increase in total sleep time and reduced variability in sleep duration, a small decline in trait anxiety score, increased frequency of solitary exercise, stable self-esteem, and an unchanged self-report of being “Happy.” The initial CES-D score of 13/60 is below typical clinical cutoffs, and the provided negative correlation between initial CES‑D and subsequent change suggests regression effects such that higher baseline scores were more likely to decrease; however, that is a population-level association and does not negate within-person indicators. These markers point to some preserved or slightly improved behaviors (more sleep, more exercise) that could buffer mood symptoms.

Holistic assessment and conclusion:
Weighing the pattern across modalities, the balance tilts toward a modest worsening in depressive symptom burden. The most salient signals are the deterioration of circadian regularity and increased intraday fragmentation, the small rise in perceived stress, greater alcohol use, later and more variable sleep timing, and reduced social exercise—changes that align with increases in depressive symptoms. These negative signals are only partially offset by small increases in total sleep time, unchanged self-esteem, and a minor decrease in trait anxiety. Taken together, the multimodal evidence supports an overall direction of increased depressive symptom burden relative to the prior data wave.

43794,0.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological analysis:

Self-report measures indicate modest improvements in internal distress and perceived health between waves. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased by 3 points (55 → 52), remaining in the high/anxious range but showing a small reduction; the reported delta has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change (Δ correlation = 0.72), so this reduction in anxiety is a signal that would tend to accompany a reduction in depressive symptoms. Perceived stress decreased from 26 to 23 (Δ = -3), and global health satisfaction rose substantially (2.33 → 5.67; Z-score of the change ≈ 3.03), both changes consistent with improved subjective well‑being. Self‑esteem remained essentially unchanged. Social behavior and activities show mixed patterns: solitary exercise frequency increased (1–2×/week vs previously 1–2×/month), while exercise with others and time socializing decreased; recreational solitary activities (video games) increased and beer consumption increased from very low to roughly 1–2×/week. These behavioral shifts (more solitary exercise, less group activity, increased alcohol frequency) represent mixed psychosocial risk/protective signals and should be interpreted in context with physiological and sleep data.

Sleep metrics suggest modest improvement in sleep quantity and stability of sleep duration. Self‑reported normal weekday sleep increased by ~1 hour (7 → 8 hours) and median wearable-measured sleep duration rose by ~23 minutes (6:59 → 7:23), while night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration decreased (SD down by ~37 minutes). Median sleep start time was essentially unchanged (≈01:00) but the standard deviation of sleep start time increased (greater variability in bedtime across nights), indicating that although total sleep increased and became less variable in length, bedtimes themselves were somewhat more inconsistent. The net pattern—longer median sleep and reduced variability in sleep duration—leans toward improved sleep quantity, although increased bedtime irregularity is a countervailing feature.

Cardiovascular and circadian metrics show clear shifts consistent with improved physiological regulation and a more robust circadian pattern. Resting heart rate declined substantially (76.0 → 62.5 bpm; Δ = -13.5 bpm; Z‑score of the change ≈ -2.82), which often reflects improved cardiovascular recovery or lower tonic physiological arousal. Circadian summary measures derived from heart rate improved: interdaily stability rose markedly (0.20 → 0.51; Z‑score Δ ≈ 2.33), autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (0.17 → 0.43), and amplitude increased strongly (4.99 → 13.08; Z‑score Δ ≈ 2.74), while intradaily variability fell slightly. The acrophase shifted earlier (approximately 6:03 PM → 4:23 PM), indicating the heart‑rate daily peak has moved earlier in the day. Aggregated hourly heart‑rate profiles show lower overnight and early‑morning values and more pronounced daytime peaks, consistent with a stronger day–night contrast. Collectively, these physiological changes (lower resting HR, greater amplitude and stability of the circadian rhythm) are commonly associated with better mood and resilience rather than worsening depressive burden.

Integration and weighing of evidence for CES‑D change:

Evidence supporting a decrease (improvement) in depressive symptom burden: (1) reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress, which are both correlated with CES‑D change (notably, STAI change has a strong positive Δ correlation = 0.72); (2) large improvements in self‑rated health satisfaction and subjective sleep duration; (3) wearable indicators of improved physiological regulation—substantial drop in resting heart rate and stronger, more regular circadian rhythm (increases in interdaily stability, autocorrelation, and amplitude)—features that are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Evidence supporting an increase (worsening) in depressive burden: (1) decreases in social engagement (less exercise with others, reduced time socializing) and increased solitary recreational behaviors; (2) increased frequency of beer/alcohol use. These social and substance‑use changes are potential risk signals but are smaller in magnitude and have weaker direct correlations with CES‑D change in the provided data than the physiological and internal distress improvements.

Holistic conclusion:

Taken together, the most robust signals—marked improvements in perceived health, reductions in stress/anxiety, increased sleep quantity, a large drop in resting heart rate, and substantially stronger circadian rhythm metrics—weight toward an overall decrease or stability (improvement) in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Social withdrawal and increased alcohol frequency are notable negative indicators but are overshadowed by multi‑modal physiological and self‑report indicators that point to improvement. Therefore the balance of the multimodal evidence supports a stable or decreased CES‑D score (improved or unchanged depressive burden).

51437,-3.0,"Multimodal self-report summary:
Self-report measures show a mixed but largely favorable pattern relative to the prior wave. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) fell from 35 to 31, a modest but consistent decrease that is accompanied by a relatively large positive delta–CESD correlation in the dataset (delta correlation = 0.72), indicating that reductions in trait anxiety in this sample typically co‑occur with reductions in depressive symptoms. Perceived stress declined substantially (20 → 15) and the participant’s general self‑reported affect (“pretty happy”) remained stable. Health satisfaction rose slightly. Social behavior shifted in a positive direction: time spent socializing increased (from 1–2 hours to 2–3 hours) and solo exercise frequency remained high (three times per week or more), though organized/team sport participation declined. Self‑esteem dropped slightly (45 → 42), and the participant reports a modest loss of perceived control over sleep duration (Agree → Somewhat Agree). Overall, survey changes most relevant to depressive burden (lower stress and anxiety; more social time; small increase in health satisfaction) point toward decreased symptom burden, while the small decline in self‑esteem and reduced sense of sleep control are countervailing but limited in magnitude.

Objective sleep and wearable activity:
Wearable-recorded sleep duration increased markedly: median nightly sleep rose by about 1 hour 10 minutes (from ≈6h15m to ≈7h25m). Sleep timing nominally shifted earlier and night-to-night variability in sleep start increased (sleep start SD increased), indicating more variable bedtimes despite longer average sleep. Self‑reported sleep latency and usual weekday sleep duration were essentially unchanged, suggesting the participant subjectively perceives their sleep as similar while objective duration improved. Activity-regularity metrics present a mixed picture: intradaily variability decreased (less fragmentation within days), which can reflect more consolidated daytime/rest patterns, but interdaily stability decreased (less regularity across days), indicating greater day‑to‑day schedule inconsistency. Taken together, longer sleep duration and decreased within‑day fragmentation support recovery-relevant processes (restoration and reduced physiological activation), while increased variability in start time and lower day‑to‑day regularity temper that interpretation.

Cardiovascular/circadian physiology:
Cardiovascular markers shifted in a direction consistent with lower overall physiological arousal. Resting heart rate fell substantially (74.3 → 65.0 bpm), and the cosinor-derived mesor (average circadian heart rate) decreased, reflecting a lower average hourly heart rate across the day. Hourly aggregated heart rates are lower across most hours compared with the previous wave, supporting the same pattern. Intradaily variability of heart-rate-derived activity decreased and amplitude changed little, while the acrophase shifted earlier (from ~7:59 PM to ~4:43 PM), indicating the timing of the daily heart-rate peak has advanced. Interpreting these together: lower resting rate and lower mesor are robust, physiologically meaningful changes suggesting reduced sympathetic tone or improved fitness/stress recovery; earlier acrophase and reduced within-day fragmentation can reflect either a modest shift toward earlier circadian timing or altered activity schedules. The decrease in interdaily stability, however, indicates that the timing changes are less consistent from day to day.

Weighing evidence for increase in depressive burden:
Few objective or subjective signals point strongly toward worsening depressive symptom burden. The primary negative signals are a small decline in self‑esteem, a decreased sense of control over sleep, reduced participation in sports/organized activity, and increased variability of sleep start times and day‑to‑day rhythm regularity. These changes have modest magnitude and mixed correlations with CES‑D change in the dataset. None of these negative changes are large or obviously matched by increases in stress, anxiety, or cardiovascular arousal.

Weighing evidence for improvement or stability in depressive burden:
Multiple independent indicators point toward decreased or stable-decreased depressive burden. Subjective stress and trait anxiety both declined notably. Objective sleep length increased substantially and night-to-night fragmentation within days decreased, which are both favorable for mood. Resting heart rate and mesor decreased markedly, consistent with reduced physiological arousal and/or improved recovery. Social engagement increased and health satisfaction rose slightly. The participant’s initial CES‑D score was very low (4/60), leaving little baseline depressive burden; coupled with the above improvements, this pattern is most consistent with stable low symptoms or a further slight improvement rather than a meaningful worsening.

Holistic conclusion:
Balancing the evidence across modalities, the preponderance of signals (lower stress and anxiety, longer objectively measured sleep, lower resting heart rate and mesor, increased social time and health satisfaction) indicate that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not worsened and is more consistent with stability or modest improvement. Negative signals (small drop in self‑esteem, decreased perceived sleep control, reduced sport participation, and lower interdaily stability) are present but limited in magnitude and do not outweigh the multiple convergent improvements. Given the very low initial CES‑D score and the combination of physiological and behavioral improvements, the most supported classification is that the participant’s CES‑D burden has stayed stable or decreased.

21932,3.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological synthesis:

The participant’s self-report and wearable-derived data together indicate a shift toward greater psychological and physiological stressors compared with the prior assessment. Trait anxiety on the STAI increased modestly (28 → 31), and perceived stress rose by five points (13 → 18); both changes point to greater subjective distress and are correlated with increases in depressive symptoms in the study sample (STAI delta correlation 0.72). Self-esteem declined slightly (50 → 47), and health satisfaction edged downward; reductions in self-regard and subjective well-being are commonly associated with greater depressive symptom burden. Social behavior shows a decline in time spent socializing (from ~31 minutes/hour to 16–30 minutes) and an elimination of group exercise (previously 1–2×/week to not at all) despite an increase in solitary exercise frequency; this pattern suggests reduced social engagement even as individual physical activity increased.

Sleep and circadian measures show marked destabilization. Median nightly sleep shortened substantially (from ~8h14m to ~7h40m, a reduction of ~1h26m) and sleep timing shifted later (median sleep start ~00:37 → 01:24), while variability in both duration and start time increased sharply (sleep-duration SD 50 → 118 minutes; start-time SD 55 → 137 minutes). These changes reflect both reduced sleep quantity and greater irregularity — features that are associated with worsening mood. Concordant wearable circadian markers show increased intradaily variability (0.57 → 0.69) and a small decrease in interdaily stability, consistent with more fragmentation and day-to-day irregularity of physiological rhythms. The acrophase shifted slightly later, and heart-rate mesor and amplitude increased modestly.

Cardiovascular recovery during the typical nocturnal period appears impaired relative to the previous wave. Resting heart rate rose by ~2.2 bpm (55.0 → 57.2), and aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show higher mean heart rates in several overnight hours (notably around 2–5 AM increased) compared with the prior recording. Elevated nocturnal heart rate and increased daytime variability can index greater physiological arousal and poorer sleep-related recovery, which are frequently linked to contemporaneous increases in depressive symptomatology.

Behavioral/contextual factors provide mixed signals. Increases in solitary exercise frequency and a self-description of being “Happy” (current vs. previous “pretty happy”) are potential protective indicators. Trust ratings rose slightly and academic performance (GPA) remains high. Substance use changes were minimal (slight shift in beer frequency). However, the combination of increased subjective stress and anxiety, reduced self-esteem, decreased social interactions, later and more irregular sleep, and signs of elevated physiological arousal constitute a coherent pattern that, in aggregate, aligns with an increased risk for elevated CES-D scores relative to the prior wave.

Evidence supporting an increase in depressive symptoms:
- Objective sleep deterioration: shorter median sleep and substantially increased variability in duration and timing—well-established correlates of worsened mood.
- Circadian destabilization: higher intradaily variability and slightly reduced interdaily stability, indicating fragmented and irregular circadian physiology associated with depression risk.
- Increased subjective distress: higher STAI and stress scores and reduced self-esteem, each of which correlates with increases in depressive symptoms in this cohort.
- Physiological arousal: higher resting heart rate and elevated overnight hourly heart rates, consistent with reduced nocturnal recovery and increased somatic stress that commonly accompany worsening depressive symptoms.
- Reduced social engagement: less time socializing and loss of exercised-with-others, which remove social buffering that can protect against mood decline.

Evidence supporting stability or improvement:
- Baseline CES-D was very low (4/60; z ≈ -0.97), indicating limited symptom burden at baseline and limited absolute room for large increases in CES-D.
- Some potentially protective signals: increased frequency of solitary exercise, a slight rise in reported happiness, and higher trust ratings.
- Many individual changes are modest in magnitude and some circadian markers (mesor and amplitude increases) are small, so absolute clinical impact could be limited.

Holistic assessment and conclusion:
Taking the pattern of change across domains into account, the preponderance of evidence (increased stress and anxiety, decreased self-esteem, reduced social engagement, shorter and much more irregular sleep, higher intradaily variability, and elevated nocturnal heart rate) indicates a move toward greater depressive symptom burden relative to the prior assessment. Although the participant began with a very low CES-D score and some protective behaviors (solitary exercise, intact academic performance, self-reported “Happy” state) remain, the convergence of behavioral, subjective, sleep, circadian, and physiological signals supports an overall increase in risk and likely increase in depressive symptom severity compared with the previous wave.

54030,0.0,"Self-report psychological and behavioral measures show modest-to-meaningful improvements in affective and stress-related domains between waves. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined by 3 points (27 → 24; Z-score change ~ -0.14), and perceived stress fell substantially by 8 points (24 → 16; Z-score of the delta -1.26), both changes consistent with reduced negative affect/arousal. Self-esteem increased slightly (49 → 50; small positive delta) and subjective health satisfaction rose (5.22 → 5.56), while self-rated happiness remained at a high level (“very happy”). Substance use was absent at both time points. Some social or activity shifts are present: organized/with-others exercise and sports frequency decreased (e.g., exercising with others from weekly to less than monthly), while exercising alone rose slightly from none to very infrequent. Time spent watching TV/videos dropped from 1–2 hours to none, and sedentary hobby time increased; overall socializing time remained steady. Trust scores declined modestly. Taken together, the self-report profile indicates lower anxiety and stress and marginally improved self-worth and health satisfaction, with mixed behavioral shifts showing reduced group physical activity but no clear increase in social isolation (socializing time stable).

Sleep and circadian behavior present a mixed pattern of small improvements in duration paired with later and somewhat more variable bedtimes. Median nightly sleep duration increased by roughly 11 minutes (6:18 → 6:30), with a reduction in night-to-night duration variability (SD decreased from 143 to 96 minutes), which suggests slightly more consistent total sleep. However, median sleep start time shifted later by ~23 minutes (02:56 → 03:19) and the variability of sleep start time increased substantially (start-time SD +57 minutes), indicating later and less consistent bedtimes specifically. Subjective sense of control over sleep remained unchanged. Objective circadian rhythm structure derived from heart-rate data improved on non-parametric indices: interdaily stability increased modestly (0.34 → 0.38) and intradaily variability decreased (0.89 → 0.70), consistent with a more regular and less fragmented daily rhythm overall despite later/more variable bedtimes.

Wearable cardiovascular metrics show a notable upward shift in average and resting heart rate alongside increases in cosinor-derived central tendency. Resting heart rate rose by ~5.4 bpm (56.6 → 62.0; Z-score change ~ +1.18) and the mesor (24-hour mean from cosinor) increased (~68.5 → 73.6). Amplitude increased modestly as well. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show higher mean heart rates across many daytime and nocturnal hours in the current wave relative to the previous wave. These physiological shifts could reflect increased tonic autonomic arousal, reduced cardiovascular fitness, or other non-psychological influences (illness, medication, measurement differences); importantly, correlations between the heart-rate changes and CES-D change are small in the dataset, so the heart-rate elevation should be interpreted cautiously rather than as direct evidence of depressive worsening. Meanwhile, the improvement in circadian regularity (lower intradaily variability, higher autocorrelation at 24h) supports more stable daily patterns, which typically covary with better mood and functioning.

Integrated interpretation and direction of change for depressive burden: the balance of evidence points to stable or reduced depressive symptom burden relative to the previous wave. Self-report indices most directly associated with mood—stress and trait anxiety—decreased meaningfully, self-esteem and health satisfaction increased slightly, and global happiness remained at a high level; these changes align with improvements in affective state. Objective sleep showed a small increase in total duration and reduced variability in duration, and circadian regularity improved, both of which are usually favorable for mood. The main contrary signal is an increase in resting and average heart rate, which may indicate higher physiological arousal or lower fitness but shows weak correlation with CES-D change in this dataset. The participant’s initial CES-D score was very low (3/60), providing limited room for large reductions; correlations provided with several psychometric deltas (e.g., STAI delta correlation 0.72) are generally consistent with the observed decreases in negative affect mapping onto decreased depressive symptoms. On balance—given the consistent reductions in subjective stress and anxiety and modestly improved circadian regularity—I conclude the participant’s depressive symptom burden has remained stable or decreased.

84502,-7.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report measures and behavior:
Across the self-report instruments there is a mixed pattern. Trait anxiety (STAI) is essentially unchanged and remains in the non-anxious range (37; down 1 point), while perceived stress decreased modestly (23 → 20). Social engagement and interpersonal trust increased (time socializing increased substantially; Trust score rose from 3.67 to 4.17), both changes that commonly accompany reductions in depressive symptom burden. Conversely, self-esteem declined slightly (RSES 41 → 39) and satisfaction with physical health fell markedly (5.22 → 3.89). Leisure and daily-habit shifts include increased internet use, reduced engagement with music, and a small reduction in sports participation. Taken together, self-report signals include clear behavioral improvements in social contact and lower perceived stress, but also declines in perceived health and modest loss of self-esteem; these patterns point to partial improvement in social/stress domains with concurrent concerns about self-evaluation and health.

Sleep and wearable-derived activity/sleep patterns:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show modest improvement and greater regularity: median nightly sleep duration increased (~7 h 31 → 7 h 53) and night-to-night variability decreased substantially (SD from 109 to 59 minutes). Median sleep start moved slightly earlier and its variability declined, consistent with more consistent sleep timing. Subjective sleep control and some self-reported sleep latency show small negative shifts, but the wearable-recorded sleep pattern indicates longer and more stable sleep overall. Improvements in objective sleep duration and consistency are generally associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and better daytime functioning, and these changes provide evidence in favor of decreased depressive burden.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm signals:
Resting heart rate decreased meaningfully (52.4 → 48.8 bpm), and the diurnal amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm increased (amplitude +3.74, large positive Z). The hourly heart-rate profile shows larger daytime peaks relative to a lower resting baseline, suggesting stronger daytime arousal/activation with lower overnight/at-rest rates. Cosinor-derived mesor is slightly lower but amplitude increase implies a larger day–night contrast. However, interdaily stability (day-to-day regularity of the rhythm) decreased (0.62 → 0.50) and intradaily variability increased, indicating greater fragmentation across days even as within-night measures improved. Overall, the physiological profile combines signs consistent with improved autonomic recovery/fitness (lower resting HR and increased amplitude) and stronger daytime activation with some loss of day-to-day regularity. The improved sleep and lower resting HR and larger diurnal amplitude point toward reduced physiological correlates of depressive burden, while the reduced interdaily stability is a mixed signal that could reflect more variable daily schedules.

Integrative interpretation of change-relevant signals:
When the different data streams are integrated, several of the strongest signals favor a reduction in depressive symptom burden: objective increases in sleep duration and stability, lower resting heart rate, increased socializing and trust, and reduced perceived stress — each of which commonly track with symptomatic improvement. Opposing signals include a modest decline in self-esteem, a clear drop in health satisfaction, decreased regularity of daily heart-rate rhythms (interdaily stability), and some shifts toward more solitary digital behavior (increased internet use, less listening to music). The magnitude of the objective sleep and cardiovascular improvements and the behavioral increase in social contact are notable and, given their typical association with lowering CES-D scores, outweigh the modest self-report declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction in aggregate.

Evidence for worsening versus improvement:
Evidence consistent with worsening CES-D (i.e., increased symptoms) is limited and primarily consists of the decrease in self-esteem and the large reduction in self-rated health satisfaction. These are relevant because they relate to self-evaluation and somatic concerns that can contribute to higher depressive scores. However, correlations provided with the changes indicate that decreases in stress and anxiety-related measures (STAI, Stress) are positively associated with decreases in CES-D, and those variables did decrease. Physiological and behavioral signals that often index improvement — increased sleep duration/regularity, lower resting heart rate, increased daytime heart-rate amplitude, increased social contact, and increased trust — are present and of appreciable magnitude.

Overall direction of change in depressive burden:
Balancing the pattern of changes across domains, the preponderance of evidence points toward a net reduction or stabilization at a lower level of depressive symptom burden relative to the previous wave. Objective sleep and cardiovascular improvements and increased social engagement and lower perceived stress are robust indicators of symptomatic improvement and outweigh the moderate negative signals from self-esteem and health satisfaction. Therefore the overall change is best characterized as stable or decreasing depressive burden.

25197,-2.0,"1) Self-report affect, stress, and behavioral engagement
The survey-derived psychological measures indicate a pattern of improved mood and reduced negative affect relative to the prior wave. Trait anxiety on the STAI fell substantially (50 → 42; large negative delta; delta Z = -0.78), and perceived stress also declined (25 → 18; delta Z = -1.04). Self-esteem increased modestly (44 → 46), and the participant now reports feeling “Very happy” rather than “pretty happy.” Health satisfaction increased slightly. Activity engagement shows more frequent solitary exercise (from 1–2 times/week to three times/week) and a small increase in organized sports frequency; recreational substance use and non-prescribed drug use remained negligible and stable. Socializing time reported decreased modestly. Taken together, these self-report changes (notably the robust reductions in trait anxiety and stress and the increase in happiness and exercise) point to an overall improvement in affective well‑being and behavioral activation since the prior assessment.

2) Sleep duration, timing, and subjective control
Wearable and self-report sleep indicators both reflect modest improvement in sleep quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep increased by about 26 minutes (from ~6:34 to 7:00), and night-to-night variability in start time and duration decreased (sleep start moved earlier by ~1 hour 18 minutes and start-time SD fell from 56 to 37 minutes). Self-reported habitual weekday sleep duration and latency were stable, while perceived control over sleep fell slightly (Agree → Somewhat Agree). The combination of increased median sleep time and tighter sleep timing suggests improved sleep consolidation and more consistent sleep timing, although the participant subjectively reports somewhat less perceived control over sleep amount.

3) Circadian regularity and rhythm metrics
Heart‑rate‑derived circadian metrics present a mixed picture. Amplitude increased slightly and mesor decreased moderately (Mesor 69.2 → 65.7 bpm; amplitude 12.66 → 13.19), and the acrophase (time of daily peak) shifted earlier (from ~4:46 PM to ~1:58 PM). Interdaily stability showed a very small decline and autocorrelation at 24 hours decreased, while intradaily variability increased modestly. These changes indicate a modest phase advance (earlier daily heart‑rate peak) and slightly greater within-day fragmentation of the heart‑rate signal, but without a large loss of rhythm amplitude. In context with earlier and more regular sleep timing and increased exercise, the phase advance and preserved amplitude are consistent with a shift toward an earlier, more consolidated circadian pattern despite a small uptick in within-day variability.

4) Resting and hourly heart-rate physiology
Resting heart rate declined (52.0 → 48.8 bpm; delta Z ≈ -0.64), consistent with either improved cardiovascular fitness or lower physiological arousal. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles changed in timing and magnitude: many nighttime and late‑evening hourly means decreased relative to the prior wave and overall resting-levels are lower, though some daytime hours show higher spikes in the current aggregated profile (notably a large value in the 9–10 AM bin). The net pattern is lower baseline cardiac tone with shifted timing of peak activity across the day, aligning with earlier sleep timing and increased exercise frequency. These physiological changes are generally concordant with reduced chronic stress/arousal reported in self-report measures.

5) Integration with CES‑D directional evidence
The participant’s initial CES‑D score was low (10/60), providing limited room for large reductions. Multiple independent indicators that correlate with CES‑D change point toward symptom improvement: large reductions in trait anxiety (STAI; delta correlation with CES‑D change = 0.72 indicates STAI reductions align with CES‑D reductions), increases in self‑esteem (delta correlation = -0.48; higher self‑esteem relates to lower depressive change), decreased perceived stress, modestly longer and more regular sleep (earlier sleep onset has a negative delta correlation with CES‑D change = -0.4), increased exercise frequency, and lower resting heart rate. A few markers move in directions that could relate to increased depressive burden (slight decline in interpersonal trust, small reduction in socializing time, small increases in intradaily variability), but these are smaller in magnitude than the improvements in affect, stress, sleep, exercise, and baseline physiology. Given the preponderance of moderate-to-robust improvements across affective, behavioral, sleep, and resting physiology measures—together with the correlate patterns provided—the balance of evidence supports a reduction or stabilization at a lower level of depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

Conclusion
Overall, the multimodal evidence indicates that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not increased; the pattern of changes is consistent with stability or modest improvement in depressive symptoms.

23270,-2.0,"Multimodal summary and context:
The participant’s baseline CES-D score was 11/60 (Z = -0.24), indicating a relatively low level of depressive symptom burden at the initial time point. Across the two-year interval, several self-report and wearable-derived indicators moved in directions that have different implications for depressive symptom change. The most salient and large-magnitude changes are a marked reduction in trait anxiety (STAI), a modest increase in global self-esteem (RSES), and a pronounced improvement in circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate. Offsetting signals include a moderate rise in perceived stress and a new, small-to-moderate increase in alcohol use. Weighing the pattern of changes requires attention to effect sizes and the known associations (correlations) between each change and CES-D change; the strongest single correlational cue provided in the dataset is the high positive correlation between STAI change and CES-D change (0.72), and the STAI change itself is large.

Self-report psychological measures:
Trait anxiety decreased substantially from 47 to 37 (Δ = -10; Z-Score of delta ≈ -1.04) and the dataset indicates a strong positive correlation (0.72) between STAI change and CES-D change. Because the STAI drop is large and positively correlated with CES-D change, it is a strong indicator that depressive symptoms likely decreased. Self-esteem increased from 37 to 40 (Δ = +3; moderate effect) and this change is negatively correlated with CES-D change (Δ correlation = -0.48), meaning higher self-esteem tends to co-occur with reductions in depressive symptoms; this provides convergent evidence for improvement. Conversely, perceived stress increased from 19 to 22 (Δ = +3; Z-Score of delta ≈ +1.11) and has a small positive correlation with CES-D change (0.26), a signal consistent with potential worsening. Overall among self-report psychological measures, the largest-magnitude, most highly CES-D–linked changes (large STAI decrease, moderate self-esteem increase) point toward a reduction in depressive burden, while the stress increase provides a competing but smaller signal.

Sleep behavior — subjective and wearable:
Subjective weekday sleep duration reported by the participant decreased from 8 to 7 hours, and sleep latency increased (20 → 35 minutes); the participant also reported a small reduction in perceived control over sleep. Objective sleep from the wearable shows median nightly sleep decreased by about 1 hour 19 minutes (8h49m → 8h08m) and inter-night variability in both start times and duration decreased (sleep start SD decreased from 79 to 54 minutes; duration SD decreased from 94 to 78 minutes). The participant’s median sleep start became slightly earlier. These changes indicate a modest reduction in total sleep time but greater regularity and reduced variability in timing. Correlational cues provided are small and mixed (e.g., sleep duration delta correlation ≈ 0.11), so sleep changes give a mixed signal: reduced duration could marginally relate to worse mood, while improved regularity and reduced variability are typically associated with better mood regulation. Net effect from sleep data is mildly favorable due to increased regularity, though the shorter duration is a countervailing factor.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show clearer improvement in rhythmic organization. Interdaily stability rose markedly (0.43 → 0.60; Z-Score of delta ≈ +1.3) and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased substantially, while intradaily variability decreased slightly. Parametric circadian features show an increased amplitude and a modest earlier acrophase (peak shifted from ~3:36 PM to ~2:13 PM), with a small decrease in MESOR. Together these indicate a stronger, more regular 24-hour heart-rate rhythm and a larger day–night contrast. Resting heart rate changed only slightly (56.0 → 57.2 bpm). The circadian regularity changes are large in magnitude and, in behavioral research, are commonly associated with better mood stability and reduced depressive symptomatology; the provided correlations between these circadian deltas and CES-D change are small but the size of the circadian improvement itself supports an interpretation toward improvement rather than worsening.

Activity, social behavior, and substance use:
Physical activity and exercise frequency remained stable at a relatively high level (exercising alone and sports three times a week or more). Social engagement increased (socializing moved from 16–30 minutes to 1–2 hours daily), which usually corresponds with lower depressive symptoms; the delta correlation is small but directionally favorable. Alcohol consumption changed meaningfully from no use to periodic use (beer 1–2 times/month; wine/liquor 1–2 times/week). The dataset’s delta correlations for alcohol are small and slightly negative, but new alcohol use represents a behavioral change that can affect mood in different ways; combined with the increased socialization and stable exercise, the net behavioral-activity pattern tilts toward greater social engagement and maintained activity, which typically reduce depressive burden, while the increase in alcohol use is a potential risk factor.

Integrative interpretation and direction of change in depressive burden:
Synthesizing the strongest signals, the participant shows large, concordant improvements on measures most tightly linked to depressive symptoms: a substantial drop in trait anxiety (large magnitude with high correlation to CES-D change) and a moderate rise in self-esteem (moderately correlated with CES-D change). Wearable-derived circadian metrics show pronounced gains in regularity and 24-hour rhythmicity, and sleep timing variability decreased — both physiological patterns that generally align with better mood regulation. Offsetting observations include a moderate increase in perceived stress and new, modest alcohol use, as well as a reduction in total sleep duration. However, these negative signals are smaller in magnitude or have weaker correlations to CES-D change than the improvements in anxiety, self-esteem, and circadian regularity. Given the relative magnitudes, the high correlational weight of the STAI change, and the concordant direction of several other mood-linked indicators (self-esteem, socializing, circadian stability, exercise maintained), the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has decreased or remained stable at a lower level compared with the prior wave.

67177,4.0,"Multimodal behavioral and psychological summary:
The participant shows a pattern of modest subjective psychological improvement alongside mixed objective physiological change. Self-report trait and state measures indicate reduced anxiety and stress: STAI–Trait decreased by 2 points (46 → 44) and the perceived stress score fell by 5 points (25 → 20). The participant also reported an explicit shift in affect from “not so happy” to “Happy,” and small increases in trust and health satisfaction are present. Self-reported weekday sleep duration increased (from 5.5 to 6.0 hours) and subjective sleep latency remained very short (5 minutes), suggesting an improved subjective sleep experience. Self-esteem was stable. Several of these subjective improvements (notably the STAI change, which has a strong delta-correlation = 0.72) are statistically associated with decreases in CES-D in this dataset, indicating they are likely relevant to reductions in depressive symptom burden.

Objective sleep, circadian, and cardiac physiology:
Wearable-derived metrics give a partially divergent picture. Median Fitbit-recorded sleep duration is slightly lower in the current wave versus the previous wave (reported medians 6 h 54 m → 6 h 32 m, a modest loss on the order of ~20–25 minutes), and the median sleep start time shifted later by about 42 minutes. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration changed little. Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate show slight weakening of daily structure: interdaily stability decreased (0.54 → 0.48) and autocorrelation at 24 hours declined (0.52 → 0.36), while intradaily variability decreased slightly. Resting heart rate and overall heart-rate MESOR increased substantially (RHR 62 → 70.6 bpm, MESOR +4.86), indicating a higher cardiovascular baseline across the recording period. These objective changes (later sleep timing, modestly shorter objective sleep, reduced 24-h rhythm stability, and increased resting heart rate) are physiologically consistent with greater autonomic arousal and somewhat less structured circadian rhythm; however, the recorded delta–CESD correlations for many of these physiological deltas are small or near zero in this dataset, suggesting weak direct association with CES-D change here.

Behavioral and lifestyle context:
Lifestyle behaviors are mixed but generally not strongly adverse. The participant reports slightly more solitary exercise (from “Not at all” to “Less than 1–2 times a month”) and reduced internet use, and they added a sedentary hobby (1–2 hours). Alcohol use shows a small increase in wine/liquor frequency (from “Not at all” to “Less than 1–2 times a month”). BMI increased from 30.04 to 32.61 (Δ = +2.57). Changes in activity, substance use, and daily recreation are modest and their delta–CESD correlations are small in magnitude, so these lifestyle shifts provide limited direct evidence for a meaningful change in depressive symptom burden in either direction.

Evidence for worsening (CES-D increase):
Objective physiology points to some markers that often accompany increased depressive burden: higher resting heart rate (+8.6 bpm) and a raised MESOR, later sleep timing, and weaker 24-hour autocorrelation and interdaily stability. BMI increased by over 2.5 points. These changes could be interpreted as signs of increased physiological stress or circadian disruption, which in other contexts are associated with worsening mood. However, in this dataset the statistical correlations between those specific wearable deltas and CES-D change are small (e.g., RHR delta correlation ≈ 0.01), so the direct predictive weight of these objective worsening indicators for CES-D change is limited.

Evidence for improvement or stability (CES-D decrease/stable):
Subjective psychological indicators show clearer improvement and stronger association with CES-D change. Anxiety (STAI) and perceived stress both decreased; STAI delta has a relatively large positive correlation with CES-D change in this sample (0.72), and stress reduction also associates positively with CES-D decreases (delta-correlation = 0.26). Self-reported mood shifted to “Happy,” and self-reported normal weekday sleep duration increased. Several small improvements in social/health domains (trust, health satisfaction) were observed. The initial CES-D score was 16/60 (Z = 0.28) and the correlation of initial CES-D with subsequent change is −0.5, which in this sample indicates that baseline level tends to be inversely associated with later increases; combined with the observed pattern of subjective improvement, this supports a likely decrease or stability (rather than increase) in CES-D.

Holistic conclusion:
Taken together, subjective psychological measures (decreased anxiety and stress, improved self-reported mood, modest increases in perceived sleep and health) provide stronger and more consistent evidence for a reduction or stability in depressive symptom burden than the objective physiological signals provide for worsening. Objective metrics do indicate increased resting heart rate and modest circadian weakening, but these changes have weak delta–CESD correlations in this dataset and therefore carry less weight for inferring CES-D direction here. Balancing evidence from both modalities, the overall pattern is more consistent with stable or modestly decreased depressive symptoms relative to the prior wave.

87328,8.0,"Multimodal summary
The participant’s profile shows a pattern of emerging behavioral and physiological changes that, taken together, are most consistent with an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. The initial CES-D was at the floor (0/60; Z = -1.38), indicating minimal reported depressive symptoms initially; despite that floor, several objective and subjective indices have moved in a direction commonly associated with increasing depressive symptoms: reduced sleep duration, reduced circadian regularity and amplitude, higher resting heart rate, increased day-to-day within-day variability of activity, increased perceived stress, reduced positive affect and social contact, and lower health satisfaction. Self-esteem remains high and trait anxiety remains low, which moderates the interpretation, but the convergence of multiple other risk-relevant signals supports an overall increase rather than stability or improvement.

Sleep and sleep-related self-report
Subjective and wearable sleep measures both show deterioration in quantity and perceived control. Normal weekday self-reported sleep duration decreased from 7 to 6 hours (Delta = -1 hr; Z-score of the change ~ -1.11), and Fitbit median sleep duration declined by ~31 minutes (7:25 → 6:54; Delta ~ -1 hr 28 min in the summary table). Sleep latency improved (self-report 60 → 30 minutes), but the participant reports a loss of feeling in control over typical sleep (Agree → Disagree; change Z ≈ -2.59). Sleep timing remained late (median start ~01:24) with little change in timing variability. Reduced total sleep and diminished perceived control over sleep are commonly associated with worsening mood and may contribute to daytime dysphoria or reduced resilience.

Circadian rhythm and activity regularity
Objective circadian features derived from heart rate/activity show substantial destabilization. Interdaily stability dropped (0.54 → 0.33; Z-change ≈ -1.51) while intradaily variability rose markedly (0.51 → 0.94; Z-change ≈ +2.83), indicating a move from a more regular, consolidated daily rhythm toward a more fragmented, irregular pattern of activity across hours and days. Cosinor amplitude notably decreased (16.19 → 8.48; Z-change ≈ -2.61), reflecting a flatter 24-hour heart-rate/activation rhythm; MESOR changed little. Autocorrelation at 24 hours also decreased. Together, these changes indicate weaker and less stable circadian organization, a pattern linked epidemiologically with increased depressive symptoms and impaired daytime functioning.

Cardiovascular/physiological arousal
Resting heart rate rose substantially (54.2 → 62.6 bpm; Delta Z ≈ +1.82). The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows changes across the day but the most clinically salient change is this elevated resting heart rate, which can index higher basal autonomic arousal or reduced cardiovascular fitness and is often observed in stress states or worsening mood. The increase in intradaily variability together with higher resting HR suggests greater physiological lability and tonic arousal, rather than increased daytime activity per se.

Self-report affect, stress, social behavior, and functioning
Subjective indicators moved toward greater stress and less positive affect/social engagement. Perceived stress increased (15 → 18; Z-change ≈ +1.11). Happiness declined from “very happy” to “pretty happy” (Z-change ≈ -1.8). Health satisfaction declined (2.67 → 1.78; Z-change ≈ -1.97). Time spent socializing decreased markedly (from >4 hours to 1–2 hours; Z-change ≈ -2.11), and other leisure activities (music listening, watching video) also declined. Exercise patterns shifted: frequency of exercising alone increased (positive for activity), but organized sports/community exercise decreased. Substance use remains none. Self-esteem is unchanged and high (Score 50; Z ≈ +1.79) and trait anxiety remains low (STAI ~24), which are protective features, but do not negate the increased stress, reduced positive affect, and social withdrawal signals.

Synthesis and evidence weighing
Evidence for worsening (increase in CES-D):
- Objective circadian destabilization (large increase in intradaily variability Z ≈ +2.27; large decrease in amplitude Z-change ≈ -2.61; decline in interdaily stability), consistent with higher depressive burden.
- Elevated resting heart rate (Delta Z ≈ +1.82) and greater physiological lability.
- Decreased objective and subjective sleep duration and reduced perceived control over sleep.
- Increased perceived stress and reduced positive affect (happiness down), plus marked reduction in socializing and health satisfaction.

Evidence for stability or improvement:
- Self-esteem remains high and unchanged, trait anxiety stays low (STAI remains in the non-anxious range with only a 1-point rise).
- Some increase in solo exercise frequency and a reduction in sedentary video time could be adaptive.
- Sleep latency improved.

Holistic conclusion
Although protective factors (stable high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, some increases in solo exercise) are present, the preponderance and magnitude of changes—particularly the marked circadian destabilization (intradaily variability and amplitude), elevated resting heart rate, reduced sleep duration and perceived sleep control, increased perceived stress, decreased positive affect, and substantial drop in socializing—point toward an overall increase in depressive symptom burden since the previous wave. Given the initial CES-D was at the floor, absolute symptom counts may still be low, but the directional multimodal evidence supports an increase.

33785,6.0,"Multimodal self-report change summary:
Between the two waves the participant shows clear unfavorable shifts on several self-report psychosocial indicators that are strongly linked to depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased by 7 points (56 → 63), moving the participant further into the ""anxious"" range; the provided delta–CESD correlation for STAI is large and positive (0.72), indicating that increases in this anxiety measure are strongly associated with increases in CES-D in the sample. Self-esteem dropped substantially (32 → 24; Z-score delta ≈ -1.46), a sizeable decline in perceived self-worth that is likely to contribute to higher depressive symptoms. Perceived health satisfaction fell markedly (4.78 → 2.0), and perceived stress increased modestly (19 → 22). Together these changes in affective, self-evaluative, and health-appraisal domains point toward a worsening profile on psychosocial risk factors that typically covary with increased depressive burden.

Sleep and circadian physiology:
Objective sleep quantity and intra-night stability improved: median nightly sleep increased by about 58 minutes (from ~7h20m to ~8h18m) and night-to-night sleep duration variability decreased (SD: 110 → 73 minutes). Sleep onset time shifted earlier (median start moved ~1.5 hours earlier) though start-time variability increased. Subjective sleep measures show mixed signals: the participant reports longer normal weekday sleep (6 → 7 hours) and greater perceived control over sleep, but sleep latency increased (20 → 30 minutes) and ideal desired sleep time decreased (8 → 7 hours). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate indicate degraded circadian regularity despite longer sleep: interdaily stability fell substantially (0.59 → 0.37), amplitude and MESOR of the circadian heart-rate rhythm decreased, and intradaily variability rose modestly. A decline in interdaily stability and amplitude suggests a weaker and less regular circadian structure, which is a known correlate of worse mood outcomes; this opposes the potentially protective signal from increased total sleep time.

Activity patterns, sedentary behavior, substance use, and heart-rate physiology:
Behavioral engagement shifted toward more sedentary and solitary leisure: time in video gaming and other sedentary hobbies increased markedly (video games from 1–2 hours to >4 hours; several sedentary activities increased), while exercise frequency remained stable. Alcohol use (beer) increased from monthly to weekly. Aggregated hourly heart-rate shows an overall lower daytime/overnight mean (Mesor and resting HR decreased: resting HR 61.2 → 56.0), with lower daytime peaks but prominent evening heart-rate elevations; amplitude of the rhythm declined. The resting HR decline could reflect improved cardiovascular conditioning or lower daytime activity levels; in context of reduced circadian amplitude and increased sedentary behavior it may also reflect reduced daytime arousal and activity rather than a clear health gain. The behavioral shift toward greater sedentary time and more evening physiological arousal (later acrophase) aligns with the reduced circadian regularity and can be interpreted as additional behavioral signals associated with increased depressive risk.

Evidence weighing for change in CES-D burden:
Evidence consistent with an increase (worsening) in CES-D: marked increases in trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D change), large decline in self-esteem, substantial drop in health satisfaction, modestly increased perceived stress, increased sedentary behavior and alcohol use, and reduced circadian regularity (interdaily stability and amplitude). Several of these changes have moderate-to-strong sample correlations with CES-D change (notably STAI). Evidence consistent with stability or improvement: objective nightly sleep duration increased and night-to-night sleep variability decreased (both typically associated with lower depressive symptoms), and resting heart rate declined (which can indicate improved fitness or reduced physiological stress). However, these protective signals are offset by the strong adverse shifts in affective and self-evaluative measures and by deterioration in circadian regularity.

Holistic conclusion:
Taken together, the multimodal data show important, large-magnitude negative changes in affective and self-evaluative domains (notably higher trait anxiety and much lower self-esteem), a pronounced decrease in health satisfaction, increases in sedentary leisure and alcohol frequency, and a clear degradation of circadian rhythm regularity despite longer nightly sleep. The balance of evidence favors an overall worsening of depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

33009,-5.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report domain:
The participant’s self-report profile shows several sizable improvements in affective and self-concept measures. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined markedly from 40 to 28 (delta −12; Z-change ≈ −1.3), shifting classification from “anxious” to “not anxious”; the reported delta has a relatively large positive correlation (0.72) with decreases in CES‑D in the dataset, suggesting that this reduction in anxiety is the single strongest survey-level predictor of a concurrent reduction in depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem increased substantially (score +10; Z‑change ≈ +1.87), and this change is moderately associated with reductions in CES‑D (delta correlation −0.48). The participant also reports being “Very happy” (previously “pretty happy”), increased trust and slightly higher health satisfaction. Stress scores rose modestly (+2 points), a direction that would typically predict increased depressive symptoms (delta correlation 0.26), but the magnitude of the stress increase is small relative to the large decreases in trait anxiety and the large increase in self‑esteem.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures:
Objective sleep and circadian markers indicate notable deterioration in sleep quantity and circadian regularity. Median sleep duration is substantially lower in the current wave (reported median ~6h52m vs previous ~7h54m; a large negative delta and Z‑change reported), sleep onset is delayed by about 36 minutes, and sleep timing variability is slightly elevated. Interdaily stability (a measure of day‑to‑day circadian regularity) decreased (current 0.31 from 0.39), and acrophase shifted later (from ~4:02 PM to ~5:43 PM), consistent with a phase delay and reduced daily regularity. These changes are typically associated with increased risk for mood symptoms; however the dataset’s small delta correlations for sleep/circadian features with CES‑D change (mostly near zero) suggest these objective sleep/circadian shifts are weaker predictors of CES‑D change in this sample than the self‑report affect measures.

Physiological arousal and heart‑rate patterns:
Resting heart rate increased by approximately 6 beats per minute (from ~56.9 to 63.0 bpm; Z‑change ≈ +1.34), and the cosinor MESOR (mean level of the 24‑hour rhythm) increased noticeably (+7.8 units, Z‑change ≈ +1.94). Hourly aggregated heart‑rate values are broadly elevated across many hours in the current wave compared with the prior wave, including during typical nighttime hours, indicating higher basal cardiovascular activation across the day and night. Amplitude of the rhythm decreased slightly, and intradaily variability remained similar. Increases in resting heart rate and elevated nocturnal heart rate often index heightened physiological arousal or reduced autonomic recovery, which can be concordant with worsening mood or stress; however the direct correlations between these physiologic deltas and CES‑D change are near zero in the supplied data, indicating weak direct predictive weight for CES‑D change in this sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle context:
Behavioral indicators are mixed. Weekly exercise frequency appears unchanged, but participation in formal sports declined. Alcohol consumption by way of wine/liquor increased frequency (to “three times a week or more”), while other substance and recreational behaviours remained low or unchanged. BMI decreased by nearly 3 points, and academic performance is stable. Socializing time and other daily recreation metrics are largely unchanged. The overall behavioral picture is not strongly one‑sided toward social withdrawal or increased substance use, although reduced sleep and increased evening physiological activation could reflect schedule or lifestyle shifts (later timing, more evening activation).

Integrated interpretation relevant to CES‑D direction:
The dataset presents a mixed signal. Objective wearable measures (reduced sleep duration, later and less stable circadian timing, higher resting and nocturnal heart rate) are consistent with physiological and behavioral features that often accompany increased depressive burden or stress-related dysregulation. Conversely, the self‑report emotional and trait measures show clear and sizable improvement: large reductions in trait anxiety, a substantial increase in self‑esteem, and higher self‑rated happiness and trust. When weighting the relative strengths of these signals using the supplied delta correlations and magnitude of change, the reductions in anxiety and gains in self‑esteem (both of which have stronger correlations to CES‑D change in the provided dataset) are the most influential predictors of a decrease in depressive symptoms. Physiological markers point to increased arousal and circadian disruption but carry smaller direct correlations with CES‑D change here. Given the participant’s relatively low baseline CES‑D (9/60) and the strong directionality and magnitude of the self‑report mental health improvements, the overall balance of evidence supports a reduction or stability (no meaningful increase) in depressive symptom burden rather than a worsening.

22913,29.0,"Multimodal self-report profile — The participant shows a complex pattern of self-reported psychological and lifestyle change. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased substantially (34 → 50; Z-change = 2.3), a shift that is large in magnitude and whose change is strongly positively correlated with CES-D change in the dataset (delta correlation = 0.71). At the same time, global self-esteem rose markedly (38 → 50; Z-change = 2.24) and current subjective happiness and interpersonal trust both increased; health satisfaction also moved upward. Perceived stress rose only modestly (+1 point) and self-reported sleep metrics (sleep latency, typical weekday sleep duration, perceived control over sleep) are essentially unchanged. The behavioral inventory shows reduced formal exercise (previously occasional → now none), increased time spent in sedentary hobbies and screen-based activities, a shift toward more frequent beer consumption, and a small increase in recreational drug use. In sum, self-report contains several strong, opposing signals: a large increase in anxiety (risk for greater depressive symptoms) co-occurring with sizeable increases in self-esteem, happiness, trust, and health satisfaction (protective signals), while lifestyle shifts (less exercise and more sedentary time, more frequent beer use) represent behavioral risks.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate signals — Circadian regularity and amplitude of the participant’s heart rate rhythm have generally strengthened. Interdaily stability increased markedly (0.36 → 0.64; Z-change = 2.11) and autocorrelation at 24 hours rose, indicating greater day-to-day regularity in the participant’s circadian pattern. Amplitude increased while MESOR decreased modestly, consistent with a lower overall mean heart rate but a larger daily excursion between trough and peak. Resting heart rate is slightly lower than previously. These changes (higher interdaily stability, higher amplitude, lower resting heart rate) typically index improved circadian organization and cardiovascular tone, patterns that are often associated with lower depressive symptom burden or greater physiological resilience.

Hourly aggregated heart rate — The temporally aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows lower mean heart rates across many hours in the current data relative to the previous period (consistent with the reduced MESOR and lower resting HR). There remain pronounced afternoon and evening heart-rate peaks in the current profile, but overall the cardiac profile corresponds to a modestly lower daily baseline and larger amplitude, which aligns with better autonomic regulation rather than hyperarousal throughout the day.

Sleep behavior and stability — Objective sleep duration remains high relative to the study population (median sleep ~8+ hours; Z ≈ 1.3) and median sleep start time moved slightly earlier with substantially reduced night-to-night variability in sleep start time (sleep start SD decreased from ~83 to ~33 minutes). These patterns indicate preserved or improved sleep quantity and markedly more consistent sleep timing, both of which are protective for mood. Self-reported sleep satisfaction and control were unchanged and corroborate the wearable sleep metrics.

Integration and interpretation relative to depressive burden — The evidence set is mixed but leans toward stability or modest improvement rather than clear worsening in depressive symptoms. The strongest single negative signal is the large rise in trait anxiety, which is strongly associated with increases in CES-D in the provided correlations and therefore raises plausibility that depressive symptoms could increase. Counterbalancing this, multiple protective signals are present and sizable: marked increases in self-esteem, reported happiness, interpersonal trust, and health satisfaction; improved circadian regularity and amplitude; lower resting heart rate; high and more regular sleep duration. Behavioral risk signals (cessation of exercise, increased sedentary time, greater beer consumption) are concerning but are more moderate in effect size relative to the very large positive psychosocial changes. The participant’s initial CES-D was at the floor (0/60), which limits the potential for further measurable improvement and makes any upward movement more detectable; however, the plurality of protective signals and objective physiological improvements suggest that overall depressive burden has not clearly increased.

Conclusion — Considering the balance of strong but opposing signals (large increase in anxiety versus large increases in self-esteem/happiness, improved sleep regularity, and stronger circadian organization), the preponderance of evidence supports that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has not worsened overall and is more consistent with stability or improvement. The available data do not provide a convergent signal of a net increase in depressive symptoms.

48969,-11.0,"Multimodal summary and baseline context:
At the first measurement the participant’s CES-D score was 42/60 (Z = 2.99), indicating a substantially elevated level of depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. The reported correlation between initial CES-D and subsequent change is -0.50, which statistically suggests that a higher baseline score is associated with a later decrease in symptom severity; this provides context but does not replace direct symptom measurement in the current wave. Interpretation of longitudinal change therefore must rely on the constellation of concurrent self-report, behavioral, and wearable physiology signals.

Self-report psychological and behavioral changes:
Several self-report indicators moved in directions typically associated with reduced depressive burden. Trait anxiety (STAI) decreased from 59 to 52 (Δ = -7, Z-score of the change = -0.66), moving away from the prior higher anxiety classification. Global self-esteem showed a large increase (Rosenberg: 22 → 31, Δ = +9, Z-score of change = +1.69), which is a strong positive psychosocial change. Self-reported overall stress changed only modestly (22 → 20, Δ = -2), but the participant’s momentary affect label changed from “not so happy” to “Happy.” Academic performance (GPA) improved across terms. These self-report shifts (lower trait anxiety, markedly higher self-esteem, greater reported happiness, improved academic standing) point toward improved functioning and affective state at the current wave.

Objective behavioral and social activity:
Reported social behavior shows notable positive change: time socializing with friends increased from 15 minutes or less to 1–2 hours (Z-score of the change = +2.18), while time spent on video games and passive internet use decreased. Exercise frequency remained stable at three times per week. Substance use remained nonproblematic and unchanged. Overall, increased social engagement and reduced passive recreational screen time are behavioral patterns frequently associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Sleep: objective vs. subjective signals and regularity:
Wearable-derived sleep quantity increased appreciably: median nightly sleep duration rose from 7 h 51 m to 8 h 58 m (Δ ≈ +1 h 6 m; Z-score of change = +1.16), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration decreased (SD 116 → 82 minutes). Sleep start time shifted later (median start ~00:06 → 01:28, later by ~1 h 22 m) but became much more consistent (start time SD decreased from 83 minutes to 18 minutes). These objective sleep changes indicate longer, more regular sleep episodes albeit beginning later in the night. In contrast, self-reported sleep latency is markedly higher in the current wave (reported 120 minutes vs prior 30 minutes), which may reflect increased time in bed before sleep onset or subjective difficulty initiating sleep despite longer overall sleep; this discrepancy between subjective latency and objective total sleep warrants caution but does not negate the overall increase in objective sleep duration and consistency.

Circadian rhythm and cardiovascular physiology:
Cardiovascular and circadian markers point to lower physiological arousal and stronger circadian structure. Resting heart rate decreased substantially (71.6 → 60.4 bpm; Δ = -11.2, Z-score of change = -2.33), and the hourly aggregated heart-rate profile is uniformly lower across nearly all hours relative to the previous wave. The circadian MESOR (mean) decreased (81.34 → 71.64) while amplitude increased (7.35 → 11.32), and interdaily stability rose slightly with intradaily variability decreasing modestly. These changes indicate a reduced baseline cardiovascular tone and a clearer, higher-amplitude circadian pattern—physiological patterns commonly associated with improved regulation and lower sustained arousal.

Signals consistent with worsening or persistent burden:
A few indicators run counter to the dominant pattern of improvement. Self-reported health satisfaction declined (5.33 → 4.0), and trust in others declined slightly. The subjective report of greatly increased sleep latency (30 → 120 minutes) could reflect a worsening sleep-onset experience or changes in perception of sleep. These changes represent potential areas of concern that may offset some improvements or reflect domain-specific difficulties (subjective sleep initiation, perceived health) despite broader gains.

Signals consistent with improvement or stability:
Stronger evidence supports improvement or stabilization of depressive-relevant domains: marked increases in self-esteem, decreased trait anxiety, increased social engagement, improved academic performance, longer and more regular objective sleep, lower resting heart rate, and clearer diurnal cardiovascular rhythm. Many of these changes have moderate-to-large magnitudes (e.g., self-esteem Δ = +9; RHR Δ = -11.2 bpm) and align with reductions in affective and somatic symptom burden. The change direction for multiple independent modalities (psychological self-report, behavior, objective sleep, circadian and cardiac physiology) is concordant.

Holistic assessment of CES-D direction:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the preponderance of data supports a net reduction in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Although the participant began with a very elevated CES-D score, concurrent reductions in trait anxiety, large gains in self-esteem, increased social activity, improved objective sleep duration/regularity, and substantially lower resting heart rate and stronger circadian amplitude collectively indicate improvement in affective, behavioral, and physiological domains commonly linked to lower depression severity. Negative signals (reduced health satisfaction and increased subjective sleep latency) are notable but relatively limited in scope compared with the broader pattern of improvements across multiple independent measures.

Conclusion (direction of CES-D change):
Based on the integrated multimodal evidence, the participant’s depressive symptom burden most likely decreased or remained stable rather than increased.

64296,4.0,"Multimodal psychosocial summary:
The participant’s baseline depressive symptom burden was very low (Initial CES-D = 3/0–60; Z = -1.07), providing a low anchor for subsequent change. Self-reported anxiety (STAI–Trait) was unchanged between waves (35.0 at both times; Z-scores around -0.5 to -0.6), indicating stable trait anxiety. Perceived stress decreased modestly (18 → 17; Z-score change small), and overall health satisfaction rose markedly (from 3.22 to 5.0; Z-Score of Delta = 1.59), suggesting improved subjective physical-health appraisal. Self-esteem declined (score delta -4.0; Z-Score of Delta = -0.72) and the participant endorsed a small reduction in happiness category (from “very happy” to “pretty happy,” with a large negative Z-Score of Delta = -1.8), representing the most notable negative changes in self-report affect/identity measures. Substance use increased from none to light social use (beer weekly; wine monthly), while recreational drug use remained absent.

Behavioral activity and sleep (self-report and wearable):
There are several positive changes in health behaviors that commonly relate to depressive symptoms. Self-reported weekday sleep duration increased by ~1 hour to 8.0 h (Z-Score now high at 1.44), and the participant reports feeling more in control of sleep. Objective sleep from the wearable likewise increased: median nightly sleep rose by ~42 minutes (6:52 → 7:34; Z-Score of Delta = 0.68), and habitual sleep onset shifted earlier by approximately 2 hr 48 min (median start ~00:56 → ~23:56). Exercise frequency increased substantially (regular solo exercise reported “three times a week or more” vs. none previously, and sports participation increased), and time in several recreational activities (reading, listening to music) increased. These behavioral changes (longer sleep, earlier and more regular bedtimes, and increased physical activity) are generally protective and would be expected to correspond with stable or reduced depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns:
Cardiovascular-based circadian structure shows a reduction in rhythm regularity and amplitude. Interdaily stability decreased (0.61 → 0.47; Z-Score of Delta = -0.99) and autocorrelation at 24 hours declined, indicating less day-to-day consistency in heart-rate rhythms. The cosinor amplitude fell substantially (16.29 → 10.77; Z-Score of Delta = -1.87) and the mesor decreased modestly (74.41 → 69.57), with acrophase shifting earlier by roughly one hour (previous ~5:03 PM → current ~4:00 PM). Resting heart rate remained stable (50.8 bpm). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles changed in distribution across the day (notably lower late-evening peaks compared with the prior wave). Reduced amplitude and lower interdaily stability can be associated with blunted circadian organization, a risk correlate for mood disturbances; however, correlations provided for those deltas with CES-D change are small in this set of data.

Integration and inference regarding depressive symptom burden:
The data present a mixed signal but lean toward stable or improved depressive burden. The strongest positive indicators are objective and subjective sleep improvements (longer duration, earlier sleep start), increased physical activity, decreased perceived stress, and markedly higher health satisfaction — all changes predictive of stable or reduced depressive symptoms. Negative indicators include a decrease in self-esteem and a small shift to lower self-reported happiness, along with wearable-derived circadian blunting and reduced rhythm regularity. Notably, trait anxiety did not increase and resting heart rate was unchanged. Given the participant’s very low initial CES-D (3/60), the behavioral improvements (sleep, exercise, health satisfaction) and stable anxiety weigh more heavily than the moderate drop in self-esteem and circadian amplitude reduction, especially because the correlations between most wearable deltas and CES-D change are small. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports either stability or a modest improvement (no strong convergent evidence of worsening CES-D).

Conclusion — direction of change in CES-D burden:
Overall evidence favors stable or decreased depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

77036,4.0,"Survey-based measures indicate modest improvement in several self-reported psychological and health domains since the prior wave. Rosenberg self‑esteem increased from 38 to 40 (near the scale ceiling), and global satisfaction with physical health rose substantially (from 3.56 to 5.0 on a 1–7 scale), while perceived stress declined (23 → 20). Trait anxiety (STAI) remained unchanged at 43. These changes are consistent with greater perceived well‑being: higher self‑esteem and health satisfaction, together with lower stress, are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. The provided delta correlations suggest that self‑esteem improvement tends to relate to reductions in CES‑D (delta correlation ≈ -0.48), and changes in anxiety are strongly associated with CES‑D change (delta correlation ≈ 0.72), although anxiety in this case did not change.

Sleep data show a mixed pattern between objective wearable measures and subjective report. Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep increased by about 30 minutes (from ~6 h 51 m to ~7 h 22 m) and bedtime shifted earlier by approximately 1 hour 23 minutes, both changes that commonly accompany improved sleep opportunity. At the same time the standard deviation of sleep duration increased and intraday variability of circadian measures rose, indicating greater night-to-night variability. In contrast, the participant’s self‑reported normal weekday sleep duration decreased (7 → 6 hours), signalling a subjective perception of reduced sleep despite the wearable showing longer median sleep. The earlier objective sleep start time has a moderately negative correlation with CES‑D change (delta correlation ≈ -0.4), implying that earlier sleep timing may be associated with CES‑D improvement in this dataset.

Behavioral activity and social patterns shifted in ways that would typically be interpreted as positive for mood. The participant reports a marked increase in social and structured physical activity: exercising with others moved from infrequent to about three times per week, socializing minutes increased, and listening to music substantially increased. These behavioral increases align with known protective factors for mood and with the observed notable reduction in resting heart rate (66.8 → 59.6 bpm), which plausibly reflects improved cardiovascular fitness or increased activity. Alcohol consumption increased modestly (beer and occasional wine), which is a risk factor for mood but the available delta correlations for substance use are small.

Physiological circadian metrics present a mixed signal. Mesor and some daytime heart-rate values declined modestly; amplitude increased slightly, but interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours decreased and intradaily variability increased — a pattern consistent with a less regular 24‑hour heart‑rate rhythm and greater fragmentation. These changes could reflect more variable daily routines despite greater overall activity. Most circadian/wearable delta correlations with CES‑D change are small, though the reduced regularity (autocorrelation and interdaily stability declines) would generally be a potential risk factor for mood worsening if sustained.

Weighing evidence for direction of change in depressive burden: indicators supporting improvement or stability include low baseline CES‑D (8/60), increases in self‑esteem and health satisfaction, decreased perceived stress, increased social exercise and recreation, earlier objective bedtimes and longer median objective sleep, and a substantial drop in resting heart rate consistent with increased activity. Indicators that could suggest increased risk for worsening CES‑D are the decreased circadian regularity and a small increase in alcohol use, as well as the subjective report of sleeping less on weekdays despite objective increases. Overall, the pattern of converging positive changes in self‑report (self‑esteem, health satisfaction, stress), increased social/physical activity, objective sleep gains, and lower resting heart rate provides stronger evidence for stable or reduced depressive symptom burden compared with the prior wave.

Conclusion: considering the balance of objective and subjective data and their typical associations with depressive symptoms in this study context, the participant’s CES‑D burden appears to have remained stable or decreased rather than increased.

82986,1.0,"Multimodal self-report synthesis:
The participant’s self-report profile shows predominantly small changes from the prior wave with a few notable exceptions. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased modestly from 25 to 27 (still in the non-anxious range; Z-scores remain low), and a general perceived stress score rose from 19 to 22 (Z-score moving from below-average toward slightly above-average). Self-esteem declined by a single point (50 → 49) and perceived health satisfaction decreased slightly; trust toward others fell marginally. Positive affect as captured by the single “happy” item remained at “very happy.” Behavioral habits are mostly stable: frequency of exercising alone remained low (1–2×/week), socializing with friends stayed at 1–2 hours, and substance use remained “not at all.” There is a small increase in BMI (25.8 → 26.6). Taken together, the self-report measures show modest increases in stress and trait anxiety alongside very small reductions in self-esteem and health satisfaction, while global positive affect and social engagement remained stable.

Wearable-derived sleep and sleep timing:
Objective sleep measured by the wearable shows improvement in several circumscribed domains: median nightly sleep duration increased by about 36 minutes (5 h 6 m → 5 h 42 m; Z-Score change +0.56), sleep onset time shifted earlier (median start moved earlier; large negative delta in start time), and night-to-night variability in start time and duration decreased slightly. These changes indicate earlier and more regular nocturnal timing and a small increase in total objective sleep. Subjective reports about “normal weekday sleep duration” decreased slightly (5.0 → 4.5 hours), revealing a discrepancy between perceived habitual sleep and the aggregated wearable measures; this suggests either recall/bias in self-report or that the wearable-recorded nights captured a modest improvement not yet integrated into the participant’s subjective sleep impression. Overall, objective sleep metrics moved in a direction typically associated with improved circadian alignment and sleep regularity, but the absolute amount of sleep remains short.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm markers:
Cardiac-autonomic indices show a pronounced reduction in baseline cardiovascular activation: resting heart rate decreased substantially (68.4 → 60.6 bpm; Z-Score of the delta ≈ -1.61) and mesor (24-hour mean heart rate) decreased (82.9 → 78.2), while amplitude of the fitted rhythm increased. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show lower nocturnal and many daytime values relative to the previous wave, consistent with a lower basal physiological arousal. Rhythm timing shifted earlier (acrophase moved from ~5:17 PM to ~3:57 PM) and interdaily stability increased (0.41 → 0.49), indicating stronger day-to-day regularity in the heart-rate rhythm. Intradaily variability, however, increased (0.62 → 0.78), suggesting greater within-day fragmentation or fluctuation of activity/physiology. Altogether, these wearable circadian/HR results point to a lower resting cardiovascular tone and an earlier, more regular daily timing profile, coupled with somewhat increased within-day variability.

Integration of modalities and implications for depressive symptom burden:
The pattern across modalities is mixed but leans toward physiological and sleep-based improvement with modest psychological stress-related worsening. Objective indicators that commonly correlate with lower depressive burden — increased sleep duration and regularity, earlier and more consistent sleep onset, reduced resting heart rate and mesor, increased circadian interdaily stability, and an earlier acrophase — are all present and of notable magnitude. Conversely, psychological self-report shows small adverse changes: stress and trait-anxiety rose modestly, self-esteem dropped very slightly, trust decreased marginally, and social exercise decreased (exercising with others ceased). The participant’s positive affect remains “very happy” and social time with friends is unchanged, which supports emotional stability despite the small increases in stress and anxiety. Given the participant’s very low initial CES-D score (4/60) and the preponderance of wearable-derived signals consistent with improved sleep/cardiovascular regulation and greater circadian regularity, the overall balance of evidence favors stability or slight improvement rather than a clinically meaningful worsening of depressive symptom burden. The few adverse self-report shifts warrant monitoring, but they are small relative to the objective improvements in sleep timing and autonomic baseline.

Conclusion (direction of change):
Considering the combined evidence from self-report and wearable metrics — objective sleep and cardiac markers tending toward improvement, and only small increases in perceived stress and trait anxiety — the most parsimonious conclusion is that depressive symptom burden has not meaningfully increased and is likely stable or slightly decreased.

11402,15.0,"Multimodal self-report profile: Several self-report measures indicate a marked shift toward greater psychological distress. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased from 54 to 57 (Z-score rising from 1.25 to 1.77), with the change strongly positively correlated with CES-D change (delta correlation = 0.72), indicating that the increase in chronic anxiety is a likely contributor to any worsening in depressive symptoms. Perceived stress rose by 5 points (from 21 to 26; Z-score delta ≈ 1.54), consistent with greater day-to-day stress exposure. Self-esteem shows a large, clinically relevant decline (Rosenberg score fell from 40 to 24; Z-score dropped from 0.26 to -2.01; score delta = -16), and the delta correlation (-0.47) links this decline to increases in depressive symptoms. Trust in others decreased substantially (score down from 3.83 to 2.67; Z-score delta -2.99), and recreational and non-prescribed drug use rose from none to occasional use. Together, these self-report changes (higher anxiety and stress, sharply lower self-esteem and trust, and increased substance use) constitute a coherent pattern associated with elevated depressive symptom burden.

Behavioral and activity changes: Social and exercise-related behaviors show reductions in social/partnered physical activity (exercising with others decreased from 1–2 times/week to 1–2 times/month) and small increases in solitary sedentary or solitary leisure pursuits (video game time increased; reading and sedentary hobbies increased). Academic performance (GPA) shows small fluctuations across semesters with no large decline. Health satisfaction and BMI improved modestly (BMI decreased by ~2 points and health satisfaction rose slightly), but the behavioral picture remains one of reduced social engagement and increased solitary, sedentary activities—patterns that commonly accompany or precede worsening mood.

Sleep—subjective vs objective: Objective sleep quantity from the wearable is approximately stable to minimally increased: median nightly sleep rose by ~10 minutes (6h19m → 6h29m) with similar night-to-night variability. However, median sleep start time shifted later by about one hour (from ~03:17 to ~04:18), increasing the gap between the participant’s stated ideal (now 8 h) and their typical weekday sleep (reported 6 h). Subjectively the participant reports a stronger sense of control over sleep duration (change from “somewhat disagree” to “strongly agree”), which may reflect perceived improvements in sleep regulation despite later bedtimes. The later and more variable sleep timing, combined with reduced habitual sleep duration relative to the participant’s stated ideal, can be consistent with mood vulnerability even when total minutes are stable.

Physiological and circadian patterning: Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate greater rhythm regularity and reduced physiological arousal. Interdaily stability increased (0.44 → 0.51), autocorrelation at 24 h rose markedly (0.13 → 0.36), and intradaily variability slightly decreased, all suggesting a more stable 24-hour heart-rate pattern. Resting heart rate decreased from 66.9 to 61.2 bpm (Z-score delta ~ -1.17), and aggregated hourly heart rates are lower across many daytime and nighttime hours relative to the prior wave. Amplitude of the cosinor rhythm increased while MESOR dropped slightly. These changes are consistent with reduced basal cardiovascular activation and a stronger, more regular circadian signal; physiologically these could reflect improved fitness, reduced sympathetic tone, or changes in daily activity timing. Importantly, the wearable signals in this case do not align with the magnitude of negative changes seen in several self-report mental health metrics.

Synthesis and implications for CES-D direction: Evidence supporting a worsening (increase) in depressive burden is substantial on the self-report side: increased trait anxiety (STAI), higher perceived stress, a large decrement in self-esteem, reduced interpersonal trust, and increased recreational and non-prescribed drug use—all changes that have documented associations with increases in depressive symptoms. Several of these changes have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D change in the dataset (notably STAI delta correlation = 0.72; self-esteem delta correlation = -0.47). Evidence supporting stability or improvement is present in the wearable physiology and some health behaviors (lower resting heart rate, improved circadian stability, modest BMI and health satisfaction improvement, small increase in objective sleep minutes). These physiological signs are likely protective or reflect improved physical health, but they do not outweigh the magnitude and psychological salience of the self-reported deterioration (especially the pronounced drop in self-esteem and increased anxiety/stress). On balance, integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a greater total weight of evidence for an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

38610,4.0,"Paragraph 1 — CES-D anchor and self-report affect/lifestyle:
The participant’s baseline depressive symptom burden (Initial CES-D = 3/60; Z = -1.07) is very low, providing a low-depression anchor for interpreting change. Self-report affect and trait measures present a mixed picture: trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) rose modestly from 28 to 31 (still in the non-anxious range; Z change 0.63) and is one of the stronger survey-level correlates with CES-D change (Delta Correlation = 0.72), indicating that any increase in chronic anxiety-proneness could track with increases in depressive symptoms. Self-esteem remained stable at a relatively high level (no meaningful change). Reported stress declined slightly (23 → 20) and overall happiness shifted down one category (from “very happy” to “pretty happy”); these affect changes are small-to-moderate in magnitude. Notable behavioral changes in self-report include substantially more socializing (from 16–30 minutes to 1–2 hours daily) and increased reported normal weekday sleep duration (from 6 to 8 hours), both of which typically relate to better mood regulation in student samples. Health satisfaction declined (5.78 → 4.44), a moderate decrease that could reflect perceived physical health concerns or other non-mood-related worries; its correlation with CES-D delta is small (−0.15).

Paragraph 2 — Sleep behavior (wearable and subjective):
Wearable-recorded sleep shows a large, objectively measurable improvement in both quantity and timing. Median sleep duration increased by roughly 2 hours 39 minutes (from ~5h46m to ~8h25m; Z-Score of Delta = 2.98), and median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 2 hours 6 minutes (from ~02:39 to ~00:46; Z-Score of Delta = −2.16). Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration remained low to slightly improved. Self-reported sleep latency was unchanged and short (≈5 minutes), and the participant’s desired and reported normal sleep both increased to 8 hours. The direction and magnitude of these sleep changes (longer, earlier, more regular sleep) are commonly associated with reduced depressive symptoms or improved recovery capacity; survey-level correlations linked earlier sleep timing with decreases in CES-D (Delta Correlation ≈ −0.4), supporting this interpretation.

Paragraph 3 — Circadian regularity and activity rhythm:
Circadian/rhythm-derived features from heart rate indicate improved daily structure: interdaily stability increased (0.36 → 0.46), intradaily variability decreased (0.61 → 0.46), and 24‑hour autocorrelation rose substantially (0.20 → 0.37). These changes reflect a stronger, more stable circadian pattern and less fragmentation of daily physiological activity, a profile that is generally associated with better mood regulation and lower depressive burden in ambulatory samples. Amplitude rose modestly and MESOR was essentially stable; acrophase shifted later (approx. 4:54 PM → 6:47 PM), indicating the timing of the daily heart-rate peak moved into the later evening. Overall, the circadian metrics point to improved rhythm stability despite a later daily heart-rate peak.

Paragraph 4 — Heart rate and physiological arousal:
Resting heart rate increased from 67.2 to 71.6 bpm (Delta = +4.4 bpm; Z-Score of Current = 1.63), with aggregated hourly heart rate showing higher evening and late-night rates in the current period (notably 8–10pm values near the upper 80s–90s). Increased resting heart rate and elevated evening rates can reflect greater sympathetic activation, lower cardiovascular fitness, medication/caffeine effects, or transient stressors; however, the small positive correlations between changes in resting heart rate and CES-D change are negligible (≈0.02). The physiological profile therefore constitutes a potential area of concern but is not strongly linked to CES-D change in these data.

Paragraph 5 — Behavioral activity and social factors:
Daytime behaviors changed in ways likely to support mood: socializing increased markedly and exercising with others remained high (three times per week or more). Exercise done alone decreased in frequency, and sedentary hobby time fell. Recreational substance use remained minimal, with only a slight uptick in wine/liquor frequency. The combination of greater peer social time and maintained group exercise are factors that typically correspond with decreased depressive symptoms, whereas loss of solo exercise and a drop in health satisfaction are potential countervailing influences.

Paragraph 6 — Synthesis and interpretation regarding depressive symptom burden:
Taken together, objective sleep and circadian metrics show robust improvements (substantially longer, earlier, and more regular sleep; greater interdaily stability and lower intradaily variability), and social engagement increased while perceived stress decreased slightly—patterns that converge on reduced depressive burden or resilience. Contrasting signals include a modest rise in trait anxiety, a small decrease in subjective happiness category, a moderate drop in health satisfaction, and a rise in resting heart rate and later acrophase; these could signal specific physical-health or autonomic concerns that are not directly mapped to CES-D change in this dataset. Because the participant’s initial CES-D was very low (3/60), large absolute decreases are unlikely; the dominant and large-magnitude signals (sleep and rhythm improvements, increased social activity, lower reported stress) outweigh the smaller opposing signals. Overall, the multimodal evidence aligns more with stability or modest improvement in depressive symptom burden rather than worsening.

Final assessment:
Considering the weight and magnitude of objective sleep/circadian improvements, increased social activity, and only small adverse shifts in anxiety, happiness category, health satisfaction, and resting heart rate, the overall balance of evidence indicates that depressive symptom burden has not increased and is most consistent with stability or mild improvement.

The participant’s self-report profile across the two sampling waves indicates stability or small improvements in psychological symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined modestly (−3 points) and remains in the “not anxious” range; perceived stress decreased by 2 points; self-esteem is high and unchanged; current affect remains “very happy.” Health satisfaction and BMI are stable at favorable levels. Substance use is absent at both waves. Social behavior shows modest increases in time spent socializing and reading, alongside greater frequency of exercising alone; activities that require others (exercising with others, organized sports) decreased. Taken together, subjective measures point to maintained or slightly improved psychosocial functioning rather than worsening mood or functioning.

Sleep behavior (subjective and wearable):
Wearable-derived sleep shows a clear positive change in quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep increased by about 1 hour and 4 minutes (from ~6:53 to ~7:57), with a reduction in night-to-night variability in duration (SD reduced by ~20 minutes) and reduced variability in sleep start times. Self-reported sleep latency, desired sleep, and perceived control over sleep are essentially unchanged. The combination of increased total sleep time and reduced variability is typically associated with improved mood and daytime functioning, and these objective improvements are consistent with the self-report reductions in stress and anxiety.

Circadian and activity-regularity metrics:
Circadian summary metrics show a mixed but small-magnitude pattern. Mesor (the rhythm-adjusted mean heart rate) increased slightly while amplitude decreased (reduced day–night heart rate range), and acrophase shifted slightly earlier (~30 minutes earlier). Interdaily stability decreased marginally while autocorrelation at 24 hours slightly increased; intradaily variability increased a little. Overall, these changes suggest preservation of a daily rhythm but with a modest reduction in amplitude and a slight increase in fragmentation of activity/heart-rate patterns. The magnitudes of these circadian changes are modest relative to the population distribution (Z-scores near zero to moderate), so they indicate subtle alteration in physiological rhythm rather than a large disruption.

Cardiovascular/physiological signals:
Resting heart rate increased substantially (from 61.1 to 69.4 bpm; +8.3 bpm, Z-score of delta ≈ 1.8), and aggregated hourly heart-rate values show higher daytime averages at several hours compared with the previous wave. This magnitude of resting heart-rate increase is notable and may reflect changes in cardiovascular fitness, autonomic tone, medication, illness, or other non-psychological factors. Importantly, the provided delta correlations indicate a very small relationship between resting heart-rate change and CES-D change, so while physiologically salient, this cardiovascular shift is not strongly predictive of depressive symptom change in the study’s correlation matrix.

Evidence for worsening (increase) in depressive burden:
Signs that could be interpreted as risk for increased depressive symptoms are limited. The main objective concern is the pronounced rise in resting heart rate and a modest decrease in circadian amplitude and interdaily stability—physiological patterns that can sometimes accompany stress, poor health, or reduced physical fitness. There is also a small decrease in interpersonal trust and a reduction in exercise with others/sports that could negatively affect mood for some individuals. However, correlations between these physiological deltas and CES-D change in the dataset are weak, indicating limited empirical linkage in this sample.

Evidence for improvement or stability (decrease/stable) in depressive burden:
Multiple self-report indicators favor stability or improvement in depressive burden. Anxiety and perceived stress both declined; self-esteem and subjective happiness remain high; health satisfaction is high and unchanged; objective sleep improved substantially in duration and regularity—changes typically associated with better mood. Social engagement (time socializing) increased, and recreational reading increased. The strongest correlation provided that is relevant to mood change is the STAI delta correlation (0.72), indicating that the observed reduction in trait anxiety is meaningfully associated with decreases in depressive symptoms in this dataset. The participant’s initial CES-D score was extremely low (2/60; Z = −1.18), leaving little room for substantial decrease, but the constellation of subjective improvements and objectively better sleep supports stable or modestly improved depressive symptom burden.

Holistic interpretation and conclusion:
Balancing the modalities, self-report data (lower anxiety and stress, stable/high self-esteem and happiness, increased social time) and clear objective sleep gains point toward stability or modest improvement in depressive burden. Physiological signals (notably higher resting heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude) are a countervailing signal but are of uncertain psychological impact in this individual given weak correlations with CES-D change and the lack of corroborating subjective worsening. Given the participant’s very low baseline CES-D score and the preponderance of evidence indicating maintained or improved psychosocial functioning, the overall directional assessment is that depressive symptom burden has remained stable or decreased rather than increased.

77711,0.0,"Self-report psychological and lifestyle measures show a mixed but concerning pattern. Trait anxiety (STAI) remains elevated (51, still in the “anxious” range) with only a negligible decrease from the prior wave (−1 point). Self-esteem exhibited a substantial decline (from 28 to 24; Z-score moved from −1.43 to −2.01), representing one of the largest negative changes across measures and a known correlate of depressive symptomatology (delta correlation reported −0.48). Global satisfaction with physical health also dropped markedly (from 3.44 to 2.11 on a 1–7 scale; Z-score change −1.28), while self-reported stress showed a small decrease (17 → 16). These data indicate worsening self-evaluative and health-related appraisals (large self-esteem and health satisfaction declines) in the context of persisting anxiety and only minimal reductions in perceived stress.

Behavioral habits show both protective and risk-relevant changes. Time spent socializing increased (from 1–2 hours to 3–4 hours), which is typically protective against depressive symptoms, and “happy” status remained unchanged. However, exercise patterns shifted away from solo activity (exercising alone decreased from weekly to monthly), and alcohol consumption increased in frequency for both beer and wine (from monthly to weekly). Sedentary hobby time and television watching decreased, but recreational patterns also include increased variability (e.g., some new brief video-game play). Overall, behavioral changes are heterogeneous: increased social contact could mitigate mood symptoms, but reduced routine exercise and increased alcohol use are risk factors that may offset that benefit.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological indicators point toward greater physiological arousal and less-regular daily rhythms. Interdaily stability declined (0.37 → 0.29), intradaily variability increased (0.53 → 0.72), and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased slightly; together these non-parametric circadian changes suggest reduced day-to-day regularity and more fragmented activity/heart-rate profiles. Resting heart rate and overall mesor increased substantially (resting HR 53.4 → 60.4 bpm; mesor 70.1 → 77.8), and hourly-averaged heart rates are notably higher across much of the 24-hour profile compared with the prior wave. These physiological shifts (higher tonic cardiac activity and reduced circadian stability) are consistent with increased autonomic arousal and circadian dysregulation, both of which have been linked to worsening depressive symptoms and poorer affective regulation.

Sleep timing and variability also moved in a less adaptive direction. Median sleep start time shifted later by about an hour (≈01:02 → 02:08), and night-to-night variability in sleep start increased. Median sleep duration is slightly lower and remains short (current median ≈6 h 41 m; self-reported normal weekday sleep still 6 hours), and subjective control over sleep duration remains “Disagree.” Later and more irregular sleep timing, in combination with short nightly sleep, aligns with the observed reductions in circadian regularity and is commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms and lower mood regulation.

Integrative synthesis and directional assessment: weighing the pattern across modalities, several strong indicators point toward a net worsening in depressive burden. Large declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction, marked increases in resting heart rate and mesor, and greater circadian irregularity and delayed sleep timing are notable signals associated with heightened depressive symptomatology. Some protective signals exist (slightly lower self-reported stress, increased socializing), but they are smaller in magnitude and appear insufficient to counterbalance the pronounced declines in self-evaluative measures and physiological/circadian dysregulation. On balance, the multimodal evidence is more consistent with an increase (worsening) in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

17020,-2.0,"Paragraph 1 — Summary of multimodal pattern:
Across the two measurement waves the participant shows a mixed pattern: clear, large improvements on self-report affective measures (notably trait anxiety and perceived stress) and increased social engagement and health satisfaction, contrasted with objectively later and more variable sleep timing and a measurable delay and elevation in heart-rate–based circadian metrics. These changes point to reduced subjective psychological burden in daily life but contemporaneous shifts in physiological rhythms and nocturnal arousal that could represent behavioral or circadian changes independent of—or only partially aligned with—self-reported mood.

Paragraph 2 — Self-report affective and cognitive measures:
Self-reported trait anxiety (STAI-T) declined substantially (40 → 33; Z-score change ~ -0.66) and the participant moved from a classification of ""anxious"" to ""not anxious."" Perceived stress declined markedly (24 → 17; Z-score of delta ≈ -1.04). Health satisfaction increased substantially (from 3.22 to 4.78 on a 1–7 scale; Z-score of delta ≈ 1.39). Self-esteem shows only a very small decrease (40 → 39). The pattern of large drops in anxiety and stress together with improved health satisfaction and increased time socializing are consistent with a meaningful reduction in subjective negative affect and daily distress, which is typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Paragraph 3 — Sleep behavior and self-perception:
Objective sleep duration increased modestly (median +35 minutes to ~7 h 42 m), but sleep timing shifted substantially later — median sleep start moved ~1 h 28 m later (from ~02:12 to ~03:41) and night-to-night variability in duration increased (+39 minutes SD). Self-reported sleep latency is long (45 minutes) and remained elevated relative to the population (Z ≈ 1.36). Notably, the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration (changed from ""somewhat disagree"" to ""agree""). Thus subjective satisfaction around sleep and overall sleep quantity improved, while objective timing became later and more inconsistent. Later and more irregular sleep timing is a behavioral pattern that can be associated with mood vulnerability even when total sleep time increases.

Paragraph 4 — Circadian rhythm and heart-rate physiology:
Heart-rate circadian metrics indicate a delayed and somewhat elevated rhythm: acrophase moved later (previously ~5:35 PM to ~8:56 PM), MESOR (mean) and amplitude increased, and aggregated hourly heart rates are higher across many hours (notably elevated during traditional sleep hours compared with the prior wave). Resting heart rate increased modestly (50 → 52.4 bpm). At the same time, interdaily stability decreased (0.54 → 0.44) and autocorrelation at 24 h declined, indicating reduced regularity across days. Intradaily variability decreased, suggesting fewer short-term transitions within days, but the overall pattern is one of a delayed, less day-to-day consistent cardiac rhythm with higher evening/nighttime arousal. Such circadian phase delay and higher nocturnal arousal are physiological patterns that can be linked to mood regulation and risk for future depressive symptoms, even when subjective mood improves.

Paragraph 5 — Activity, social behavior, and lifestyle:
The participant reports increased socializing with friends (substantial increase in time) and modest increases in participation in sports and recreational activities. Alcohol use changed minimally with some reported uptake of wine/liquor from none to occasional. Internet use and video gaming increased from not at all to modest use. Overall, social engagement increased — a behavioral change that tends to support mood improvement — while some leisure behaviors and later bedtimes may reflect evening-oriented lifestyle choices that accompany the circadian shifts described above.

Paragraph 6 — Integration relative to CES-D change:
Direct indicators that support a decrease in depressive burden are strong: significant decreases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, increased social engagement, and higher health satisfaction all typically accompany reductions in depressive symptoms. Objective signals that could indicate risk or a countervailing trend include delayed and less regular sleep timing and later/elevated heart-rate acrophase with greater nocturnal heart rate, which can be associated with mood dysregulation. Self-esteem changed negligibly and the participant’s initial CES-D was low (10/60). Taken holistically, the magnitude and consistency of improvements in affective self-report (large drops in anxiety and stress) and increased socialization provide stronger evidence of a net reduction or stabilization at a lower level of depressive symptom burden than the physiological circadian changes suggest for worsening. Therefore the balance of multimodal evidence points to stable or decreased depressive symptoms relative to the prior wave.

22455,13.0,"Multimodal self-report profile and psychosocial behavior:
Between waves the participant shows a large increase in trait anxiety (STAI trait: 28 → 46, delta +18; Z-score change +2.55), a change that is both large in magnitude and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change in the dataset (delta correlation = 0.72). Self-esteem declined modestly (Rosenberg: 46 → 43, delta −3; Z-score change −0.53) — a direction of change that, given the reported delta-correlation (−0.48), is consistent with increases in depressive symptoms. Objective stress ratings moved down slightly (30 → 26), and health satisfaction rose marginally, but several behavioral indicators that commonly relate to mood show reductions in social and recreational engagement: time spent socializing with friends fell dramatically (from ~2–3 hours to 16–30 minutes), listening to music and TV/video time declined, and internet use increased. Substance use and exercise frequency (exercising alone three times/week) were stable. Taken together, the self-report pattern is mixed but dominated by a very large, high-signal increase in trait anxiety and a modest fall in self-esteem plus marked social withdrawal—features that typically track with worsening depressive symptomatology.

Objective sleep and subjective sleep control:
Wearable-recorded sleep duration improved in aggregate: median nightly sleep increased by ≈44 minutes (6 h 7 m → 6 h 51 m) and night-to-night variability decreased (sleep SD 142 → 98 minutes), while median sleep start shifted earlier by ≈1 h 14 m and start-time variability decreased. These objective changes indicate longer and more regular nocturnal sleep. Self-reported habitual weekday sleep remained short (self-report 5.0 hours unchanged) and the participant reported a decline in perceived control over sleep (from “Strongly Agree” to “Somewhat Agree”), suggesting a divergence between objective sleep gains and the participant’s subjective sleep experience/control. Improved objective sleep regularity and duration would usually point toward decreased depressive burden, but the loss of subjective control may mitigate that benefit.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm indicators:
Several heart-rate–based metrics indicate increased physiological activation and altered rhythm structure. Resting heart rate rose substantially (52.5 → 60.2 bpm; delta +7.7; Z-score of delta ~1.67), MESOR increased (~65.4 → 74.7 bpm; delta +9.34; Z-score delta 2.27), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows higher mean heart rates across many daytime hours and an earlier, larger morning rise relative to the prior wave. Intradaily variability increased (0.61 → 0.80; Z-score delta 1.13), indicating more fragmentation/short-term variability in activity/physiology across the day, while interdaily stability remained essentially unchanged. Amplitude decreased modestly. In sum, wearable physiology shows heightened tonic cardiovascular activity and greater within-day fragmentation—physiological patterns that commonly accompany increased anxiety/arousal and can accompany worsening mood.

Synthesis relating multimodal evidence to CES-D change:
The initial CES-D score was low (12/60). Notwithstanding the objective sleep improvements, the strongest and most directly relevant signals point toward increased affective burden: a very large increase in trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES-D change), modest reduction in self-esteem (correlated with depressive change), substantial loss of social engagement, and physiologic markers of elevated arousal (higher resting HR, higher MESOR, increased intradaily variability). Where evidence suggests improvement (longer, more regular sleep; slightly lower stress ratings; small increase in health satisfaction), these are smaller in magnitude or less specifically correlated with CES-D change than the anxiety and physiological signals. Given the relative magnitude and established associations (especially the large STAI increase and physiological activation), the balance of multimodal evidence indicates an increased depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

57443,0.0,"Multimodal sleep and subjective sleep-report profile
The participant shows clear improvements in both objective and subjective sleep metrics relative to the previous wave. Median nightly sleep duration measured by Fitbit increased by ~28 minutes (from 7:14 to 7:42; Z-score change ≈ +0.41) and self-reported normal weekday sleep increased from 6 to 8 hours (large Z change 1.93). Sleep latency reported on the survey decreased from 15 to 5 minutes (Z change −0.76). The participant also reports a substantial change in perceived control over sleep (from “strongly disagree” to “somewhat agree”; Z-change +2.18). These changes, taken together, indicate longer and subjectively more restorative sleep episodes. However, sleep timing shifted later (median sleep start ~31 minutes later) and night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased (SD up by ~24 minutes), showing some loss of consistency even as total duration improved.

Self-report affect, stress, and psychosocial measures
Several self-report affect and psychosocial indicators moved in a mixed pattern. State/trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased modestly (40 → 42), and self-esteem dipped slightly (39 → 37). Global health satisfaction decreased (4.56 → 3.0), and BMI rose by 1.51 points. Conversely, perceived stress on the survey decreased (25 → 22), reported socializing time increased (from 1–2 to 2–3 hours), and the respondent reported being “pretty happy” (previously “happy”), indicating small shifts in positive social engagement and lower reported stress. Alcohol use increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a month,” a small behavioral risk change. Overall, the psychosocial profile contains both improvements (lower stress, more social contact) and small adverse changes (higher anxiety, lower self-esteem and health satisfaction).

Behavioral activity and social engagement
Daily activity and leisure patterns show increased social and active engagement alongside more sedentary/online behaviors. Frequency of exercising with others and participation in sports increased (both changes with positive Z-change values), and time spent socializing rose. At the same time, reported internet usage and watching videos increased substantially (large Z-change), and sedentary hobbies appeared more often. These data suggest greater social and structured physical activity but also increased passive screen-based pastime. The net behavioral shift leans toward increased social/physical engagement but with more mixed leisure habits.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian rhythm signals
Cardiovascular indicators are largely consistent with lowered baseline physiological arousal: resting heart rate decreased from 64.0 to 57.6 bpm (Δ −6.4 bpm; Z-change ≈ −1.31), and MESOR decreased (81.35 → 72.44; Z-change −1.71). Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles show broadly lower rates across many daytime and nighttime hours relative to the previous recording. These changes are typically associated with reduced tonic sympathetic arousal or improved aerobic fitness. In contrast, circadian rhythm regularity metrics showed deterioration: interdaily stability declined (0.54 → 0.44) and autocorrelation at 24 hours dropped substantially (0.51 → 0.24), indicating weaker day-to-day regularity of the heart-rate rhythm despite preserved intraday variability. Amplitude decreased modestly. Thus physiology suggests lower resting arousal but less consistent circadian structure.

Integration and interpretation relative to CES-D change
Putting modalities together, several robust signals that commonly covary with reductions in depressive symptoms are present: longer and subjectively improved sleep, lower self-reported stress, increased social and group exercise, and a notably lower resting heart rate. These collectively point toward decreased symptom burden. Offsetting these improvements are smaller but meaningful adverse signals: a modest increase in trait anxiety, decreased self-esteem and health satisfaction, rising BMI, increased alcohol use and screen-based leisure, and a substantial weakening of circadian stability. Correlation indices in the dataset suggest that increases in anxiety and decreases in self-esteem would be expected to associate with increased CES-D, whereas reductions in stress and improvements in sleep typically associate with decreases. The initial CES-D value (19/60) was moderate; its negative correlation with subsequent change suggests regression toward lower scores is plausible for participants at that baseline.

Overall directional assessment of depressive burden
On balance, the preponderance of behavioral and physiological changes—particularly the improvement in sleep quantity and subjective sleep control, reduced reported stress, increased social and group activity, and lower resting heart rate—align with a reduction or stabilization of depressive symptom burden. Countervailing signals (small increases in anxiety, reductions in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and decreased circadian regularity) introduce some risk for symptom persistence or partial worsening, but their magnitudes are generally smaller than the positive changes and/or mixed in expected impact. Considering the full multimodal picture, the evidence more strongly supports a stable or decreased CES-D burden rather than an increase.

29257,1.0,"Self-report instruments show a mixed pattern. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased modestly (31 → 29), consistent with a small reduction in self-reported chronic anxiety and with a relatively large positive correlation between STAI change and CES-D change in the dataset (delta correlation = 0.72). Global stress score also fell slightly (19 → 18). In contrast, self-esteem declined substantially (46 → 40; score delta = −6, Z-score of delta ≈ −1.09), and self-rated satisfaction with physical health decreased (Δ ≈ −0.89). Social and substance-use behaviors were largely stable, although exercise with others decreased in frequency. Subjective happiness remained “pretty happy.” Taken together, the self-report pattern is heterogeneous: small improvements in anxiety and stress coexist with a notable drop in self-esteem and in health satisfaction — changes that, in many models, increase vulnerability to higher depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a pronounced adverse shift. Median nightly sleep duration fell from 7 h 49 min to 6 h 6 min (Δ ≈ −2 h 17 min; Z-score of the change ≈ −2.18), and median sleep start time shifted later by ~1 h 6 min. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration remained high (SD ≈ 150 min) and essentially unchanged. The combination of a large reduction in total sleep time and later sleep timing is a biologically meaningful change: acute and sustained sleep loss and delayed timing are commonly linked to worsening mood and increased depressive symptoms. The change in sleep timing also shows a moderate correlation with CES-D change in the dataset (delta correlation = −0.40), indicating that timing shifts are relevant to depressive symptom dynamics in this sample.

Circadian- and heart rate–based measures present a mixed picture of physiological regulation. Interdaily stability increased modestly (0.3 → 0.4) while intradaily variability also rose (0.47 → 0.64), suggesting more consistent day-to-day structure but more within-day fragmentation. Resting heart rate decreased (67.65 → 65.0 bpm) and mesor decreased slightly, while amplitude increased; aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show lower overnight heart rates relative to the prior wave and somewhat reduced mid-day peaks, although evening hours still include elevated values. Lower resting heart rate and increased interdaily stability are generally consistent with improved autonomic regulation and circadian regularity, whereas higher intradaily variability can indicate more frequent transitions in activity/arousal states. These physiological shifts therefore contain both potentially protective (lower resting HR, higher stability) and potentially destabilizing (greater intraday variability) elements.

Holistic synthesis and directional assessment: the dataset presents competing signals. Improvements in trait anxiety, small reduction in perceived stress, lower resting heart rate, and modest gains in day-to-day regularity are evidence consistent with stable or improved affective state. Countervailing and salient signals favoring worsening include a large objective reduction in nightly sleep duration (≈2+ hours), a clear delay in sleep timing, and a substantial drop in self-esteem and health satisfaction. Given the magnitude of the sleep-duration loss and the size of the self-esteem decline — both of which are robustly associated with increases in depressive symptoms and stand out relative to other metric changes — the balance of evidence indicates an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Therefore, despite some physiological and anxiety-related signs of improvement, the pronounced deterioration in sleep and self-esteem supports an inference of worsening CES-D score.

63904,-8.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological summary:
Wearable-recorded sleep and circadian metrics show marked deterioration in nocturnal sleep quantity and circadian regularity between waves. Median nightly sleep fell by approximately 2 hours 39 minutes (from ~5h49m to ~4h29m; Z-change ≈ -1.74), and the median sleep onset shifted later by ~1h14m. Sleep timing became slightly less variable in the Fitbit-derived start-time SD but overall sleep duration variability increased (SD up ~21 minutes). Circadian stability measures derived from heart rate rhythms are consistent with reduced circadian organization: interdaily stability declined (0.59 → 0.47), mesor and amplitude of the circadian fit decreased (mesor −6.39 bpm; amplitude −2.48), and acrophase shifted later by ~35 minutes (3:22 PM → 3:57 PM). Resting heart rate dropped substantially (61.6 → 54.6 bpm), and the hourly aggregated heart-rate profile shows lower mean rates across many daytime hours relative to the prior wave. The combination of later, shorter sleep with reduced interdaily stability and smaller amplitude suggests a state of reduced circadian robustness and shorter sleep opportunity, while lower resting and daytime heart rates may reflect concurrent changes in autonomic tone or fitness; these physiological changes are relevant because both disrupted sleep/circadian structure and alterations in arousal regulation are commonly linked with mood symptom fluctuations.

Self-report psychological traits, behaviors, and context:
Survey measures present a mixed but concerning picture for affective state. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased modestly (53 → 55; Δ=+2; z-delta ≈ 0.5), while self-esteem decreased by 4 points (30 → 26; z-delta ≈ −0.72). Self-reported general health satisfaction fell substantially (3.44 → 2.11; Δ=−1.33). Recreational substance use and exercise frequency remain at “not at all,” and academic performance appears stable. Social behavior shifted: reported socializing time decreased (from 2–3 hours to ~31 minutes), internet use increased (2–3 hrs → >4 hrs), and listening to music increased. Notably, perceived stress fell markedly (23 → 15; Δ=−8), and the single-item mood descriptor moved from “not so happy” to “Happy.” These self-reports show both negative signals (higher anxiety, lower self-esteem, reduced social contact, lower health satisfaction) that are commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms and some positive signals (lower perceived stress, self-reported happier single-item mood) that would point toward improvement.

Synthesis linking modalities to depressive change:
Several of the largest-magnitude and high-psychological-relevance changes align with increased depressive burden. Large objective reductions in sleep duration and later sleep timing, plus decreased interdaily stability and amplitude of circadian heart-rate rhythms, are established risk correlates of worsening depressive symptoms; the magnitude of the sleep loss here is especially notable. Concurrently, trait anxiety increased and self-esteem decreased—changes that, per the provided delta correlations, are strongly associated with increases in CES-D (STAI delta correlation ≈ 0.72; self-esteem delta correlation ≈ −0.48, where lower self-esteem changes map to increased depressive symptoms). Behavioral signs that often accompany worsening mood—marked reduction in socializing and increased passive internet use—are present. Some contradictory signals exist: perceived stress dropped substantially and the single-item “Happy” improved, and resting heart rate decreased (which could index improved fitness or autonomic shifts). However, the stress reduction may reflect changes in external demands or coping rather than core affective improvement, and isolated positive items are offset by several converging objective and trait-level indicators of deterioration.

Overall assessment of CES-D direction:
The participant’s baseline CES-D score (30/60; Z ≈ 1.74) indicates elevated depressive symptoms initially; the provided negative correlation (−0.5) between initial CES-D and subsequent change suggests some regression-to-the-mean tendency, but that does not override the multimodal pattern. When integrating the strongest and most consistent signals—pronounced objective sleep loss and circadian disruption, increases in trait anxiety, decreases in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and reduced social engagement—the preponderance of evidence points toward an increase in depressive symptom burden since the prior wave. Positive signals (lower perceived stress, single-item “Happy,” and lower resting HR) are present but smaller in conceptual weight relative to the large sleep/circadian and self-concept changes that are robust predictors of worsening depressive symptoms.

33657,18.0,"Self-report measures show marked negative shifts on several proximal psychological indicators that are commonly associated with depressive symptom change. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased substantially from 37 to 53 (score delta +16, Z-delta 2.3) moving the participant from the “not anxious” to “anxious” range; this delta has a strong positive correlation (0.71) with CES-D change in the study, indicating that this large rise in trait anxiety is a salient risk signal for an increase in depressive symptoms. Self-esteem declined dramatically (RSES from 41 to 22; score delta -19, Z-delta -3.5), a large-magnitude change whose delta is moderately associated with CES-D change (delta correlation -0.47, such that decreases in self-esteem are associated with increases in CES-D). Subjective global mood shifted slightly downward (from “happy” to “pretty happy”) and satisfaction with physical health fell notably (4.56 to 2.89, Z-delta -1.59). Conversely, perceived stress on the scale provided decreased (20 to 15), but the magnitude and direction of the anxiety and self-esteem changes are larger and more directly linked to CES-D change in this sample than the stress reduction.

Objective sleep and circadian physiology reflect worsening regularity and increased physiological arousal. Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration increased substantially: sleep start time standard deviation rose from 64 to 140 minutes (Z-delta ~1.56) and sleep duration SD from 63 to 114 minutes (Z-delta 1.3), indicating more irregular sleep schedules. Median sleep duration shows a small reduction in average duration (current median ~6h53m, previous ~7h5m) and the participant reports feeling less in control of sleep. Circadian rhythm summaries derived from heart rate show increased intradaily variability (from 0.67 to 0.94; Z 2.27), decreased amplitude, and only marginal change in interdaily stability—together suggesting more fragmented, lower-amplitude daily physiological rhythms. Resting heart rate rose from 54 to 57.2 bpm and many aggregated hourly heart rates are higher across both daytime and some nighttime hours relative to the prior period; this modest increase in tonic cardiovascular activation is consistent with increased physiological arousal or lowered recovery. These sleep and circadian changes are known correlates of worsening mood symptoms and, given their magnitude (especially variability measures), support a pattern toward increased depressive burden.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators are mixed but include risk-relevant declines in activity and health satisfaction. Frequency of exercise declined (exercised alone moved from weekly to 1–2 times a month; exercised with others decreased as well), which is a behavioral change associated with worse mood maintenance. Sedentary hobby time decreased sharply (from >4 hours to 16–30 minutes), and socializing increased (1–2 hours to 2–3 hours), both of which could be protective; alcohol (beer) use declined. Academic performance (GPA) shows small fluctuations but no large drop. Overall, behavioral evidence is heterogeneous: some social engagement increased and sedentary leisure decreased (potentially protective), but reductions in regular exercise and marked declines in perceived health are risk factors that together lean toward increased depressive burden.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: the largest-magnitude and most CES-D–relevant changes are the large increase in trait anxiety and the very large drop in self-esteem, both of which in this dataset have moderate-to-strong associations with CES-D change. These psychological changes are complemented by objective signs of circadian fragmentation and increased physiological arousal (greater intradaily variability, increased sleep timing variability, modestly higher resting heart rate), and by reduced exercise and health satisfaction. Some positive signals (reduced self-reported stress, increased social time, decreased sedentary hobby time) partially offset risk but are smaller in magnitude or less directly linked to CES-D trajectories here. On balance, the preponderance of evidence—especially the very large, correlated worsening in anxiety and self-esteem together with more fragmented sleep/circadian patterns—indicates an overall increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the previous wave.

Self-esteem declined substantially (45 → 40; Z-change ≈ -0.9), and the change in self-esteem is moderately negatively correlated with CES-D change (delta correlation = -0.48), which in this dataset implies that the observed drop in self-esteem would be expected to accompany an increase in depressive symptoms. The participant also reports being less happy (""very happy"" → ""pretty happy"") and shows a marked reduction in trust in others (score decline with large negative Z-change), both of which are directionally consistent with increased depressive burden. In contrast, perceived stress decreased (21 → 18) and overall health satisfaction increased; these changes would be expected, all else equal, to relate to reduced depressive symptoms (stress delta correlation = 0.26; health satisfaction delta correlation modest and negative). The pattern across self-report measures is therefore mixed, but core mood-related items (anxiety, self-esteem, subjective happiness, social trust) shift in a direction that is typically associated with worse depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Wearable metrics indicate greater regularity of daily physiology but shorter average sleep. Non-parametric circadian metrics that index rhythm regularity increased (interdaily stability modestly up; autocorrelation at 24 hours increased markedly), and sleep timing variability declined substantially (sleep start time SD fell from ~100 to ~39 minutes). These changes indicate a more regular and stable daily schedule. Resting heart rate and overall mean heart rate (mesor) decreased from the prior wave (resting HR 72.3 → 67.8; mesor decreased), and aggregated hourly heart rates are lower across most hours — changes consistent with lower physiological arousal or improved cardiovascular fitness. Conversely, amplitude of the circadian heart-rate rhythm decreased (smaller amplitude), which can reflect a blunting of daily physiological range. Sleep quantity declined: median sleep shortened from 7 h 39 min to 6 h 55 min and the participant’s usual sleep onset shifted slightly later. Taken together, wearable data show improved regularity and lower tonic arousal (which often correlate with better functioning) but also shorter sleep duration and reduced amplitude of circadian variation (which can be associated with vulnerability to mood symptoms).

Integration and interpretation of directional change in depressive burden:
Weighing the evidence across modalities, there are competing signals. Objective physiology points toward improved regularity and reduced resting arousal — potentially protective changes. However, the most diagnostically relevant self-report indicators (trait anxiety increase, decreased self-esteem, lower reported happiness, reduced interpersonal trust and less social time) are changes that, in this dataset and in the literature, are more strongly predictive of increases in depressive symptoms. Several of those self-report deltas have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D change in the provided metadata (especially the STAI delta). Sleep became shorter despite being more regular; reduced sleep duration typically contributes to worse mood even when timing regularity improves. Although stress scores and health satisfaction improved (factors that would push toward decreased depressive burden), the magnitude and the known predictive strength of the affective/interpersonal changes support an overall increase in depressive symptom burden.

Conclusion:
On balance — giving particular weight to the changes in trait anxiety, self-esteem, subjective happiness, and social/trust indicators, and considering the concurrent reduction in sleep duration — the totality of evidence favors an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

92515,2.0,"Multimodal self-report summary:
Over the two-year interval the participant shows a pattern of small but directionally consistent changes on several self-report psychological scales that are typically relevant to depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety on the STAI rose modestly (36 → 37), and the documented correlation between STAI change and CES-D change is relatively large (0.72), indicating that even this small increase in anxiety is a risk-consistent signal with respect to increases in depressive symptoms. Global self-esteem declined by three points on the Rosenberg scale (41 → 38); the magnitude of that drop and its negative delta-correlation with CES-D change (–0.48) likewise point toward a relationship between falling self-esteem and increased depressive burden. Subjective positive affect also decreased (described change from “very happy” to “pretty happy”), and trust in others fell substantially (3.67 → 3.0; Z-change ≈ –1.75). These converging self-report changes—higher anxiety, lower self-esteem, reduced perceived happiness and trust—are psychosocial signals that, on balance, align with an increased depressive symptom profile.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian signals:
Cardiovascular circadian metrics derived from heart rate indicate reduced rhythm strength and modestly elevated tonic activation. The cosinor amplitude decreased (9.0 → 7.73, Z ≈ –1.14) and MESOR fell slightly (~2.2 bpm), while resting heart rate increased by ~2 bpm (56.8 → 58.8). Interdaily stability (day-to-day regularity) declined (0.46 → 0.33), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is essentially unchanged. These changes—reduced circadian amplitude and stability together with a small rise in resting HR—are commonly observed in states of increased physiological stress or reduced circadian organization and are therefore consistent with a shift toward greater depressive burden. The participant’s aggregated hourly heart-rate profile also shows an earlier acrophase (peak moved from ~4:25 PM to ~3:39 PM) and modest redistribution of daytime heart-rate values, suggesting some change in timing of daily physiology rather than a simple increase or decrease in overall activity.

Sleep behavior and variability:
Objective sleep duration increased slightly (median 5 h 55 m → 6 h 13 m, +18 minutes) and median sleep start time moved earlier (≈02:57 → 02:39), while night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased (SD 94 → 123 minutes) and variability of sleep start time decreased (SD 110 → 60 minutes). In other words, the participant is obtaining a marginally greater median sleep amount and going to bed somewhat earlier and with more consistent timing, but the amount of sleep is more variable from night to night. Small positive changes in sleep duration and an earlier, more regular bedtime can be protective or restorative, but the increased variability in total sleep and the relatively short absolute sleep duration (<6.5 hours median) temper that benefit. Correlations provided with CES-D change for these sleep metrics are small to moderate and mixed in sign, so sleep signals alone are not decisive.

Behavioral lifestyle indicators:
Objective and self-reported lifestyle changes are mixed. The participant reports exercising more often alone (increase from 1–2×/month to 1–2×/week), which is a behavioral change typically associated with mental health benefit. Reported alcohol use appears reduced for wine/liquor (from weekly to monthly), and reported stress decreased slightly (19 → 18). Conversely, recreational habits shifted toward more video game time (newly 2–3 hours) and less socializing/listening to music, and perceived health satisfaction decreased modestly. The reduction in interpersonal trust and decreased self-esteem and positive affect outweigh, in my assessment, the modest improvements in exercise frequency and slight stress reduction when considering signals relevant to depressive change.

Synthesis and overall directional judgment:
Balancing the data across modalities, several psychosocial indicators that strongly relate to depressive symptom increases moved in an adverse direction: increased trait anxiety (STAI), reduced self-esteem, reduced subjective happiness, and a marked drop in trust. These self-report changes are supported by physiological/circadian signals that also tilt toward greater burden—reduced amplitude and interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms and a small rise in resting heart rate. Objective sleep shows a small gain in median sleep and earlier, more regular bedtimes (potentially protective), but greater night-to-night sleep variability and persistently short total sleep limit that benefit. Lifestyle changes are mixed but do not counterbalance the consistent pattern of worse affective and circadian signals. Given the relatively large positive correlation between STAI delta and CES-D change (0.72) and the moderate negative correlations linking drops in self-esteem and happiness with CES-D change, the preponderance of evidence indicates an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Note that the participant’s baseline CES-D was very low (4/60), so absolute symptom levels remain low even if the directional change is toward greater depressive burden.

48154,0.0,"Paragraph 1 — Self-report psychological measures and affective state:
Across the self-report instruments, the participant shows small-to-moderate improvements in anxiety and perceived stress and stable-to-high self-evaluative functioning. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased from 30 to 26 (moving further into the non-anxious range), and reported stress fell from 21 to 17, both changes consistent with lower momentary and trait negative affect. Rosenberg self-esteem remains high and stable. Subjective happiness is unchanged at ""very happy."" Health satisfaction increased modestly. Taken together, these survey-level shifts indicate improved or stable positive affect and self-evaluation rather than worsening mood symptoms.

Paragraph 2 — Sleep: subjective reports versus actigraphy-derived metrics:
Objective sleep timing and variability show modest change while subjective control over sleep decreased. The Fitbit-derived median sleep start shifted earlier (from ~01:03 to ~00:47) and median nightly sleep duration is slightly reduced (reported medians: 8:03 previously to 7:42 currently). Night-to-night variability in both sleep duration and sleep start time increased, and the participant explicitly endorsed losing a sense of control over their typical sleep amount (changed from Agree to Disagree). Sleep latency and the participant’s ideal sleep duration remained stable. Overall, the objective signal is of slightly shorter and more variable sleep, paired with increased subjective loss of control over sleep — a pattern that can reflect lifestyle change or disrupted sleep regularity even when average duration remains near normative ranges.

Paragraph 3 — Wearable circadian and cardiovascular indicators:
Heart-rate-based circadian regularity and amplitude increased. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation rose relative to the prior wave, and the cosinor amplitude increased substantially, indicating a stronger daily rhythm in heart rate across days. Resting heart rate decreased slightly (56.0 → 54.8 bpm), consistent with modest improvement in baseline cardiovascular tone or fitness. Aggregated hourly heart rate shows relatively higher activity/arousal in late afternoon and early evening hours and lower overnight values compared with the prior period; the acrophase (time of peak) shifted slightly earlier. These changes collectively indicate a clearer and somewhat more robust diurnal pattern in autonomic activity, which is often associated with more stable daily routine and can relate to lower depressive symptomatology.

Paragraph 4 — Behavior, social interaction, and substance use:
Activity patterns show a mixed profile. The participant continues to exercise regularly (exercising alone three times a week or more; sports frequency increased), which is generally protective for mood. However, socializing time with friends decreased markedly (previously ~1–2 hours to ~31 minutes), and exercising with others moved to not at all, suggesting reduced in-person social engagement. Recreational drug use increased slightly to a low-frequency level (1–2 times a month). Leisure behaviors shifted toward more passive solitary activities: time listening to music and watching videos increased substantially, and internet use rose. These behavioral shifts are ambivalent for mood: increased individual exercise and more structured daily rhythm support improved mood, whereas decreased social contact and increased solitary media consumption could represent compensatory coping or social withdrawal, which may counterbalance other positive changes.

Paragraph 5 — Synthesis and implications for depressive burden:
Multiple independent indicators point toward stable or reduced depressive burden relative to the prior wave. Reductions in trait anxiety and perceived stress, stable-high self-esteem, improved health satisfaction, a modest decline in resting heart rate, and stronger circadian amplitude and interdaily stability are all concordant with maintained or improved mood and functioning. Contrasting signals—reduced social interaction, greater solitary leisure and increased night-to-night sleep variability, plus a small uptick in recreational drug use—represent risk or compensatory behaviors but are not large in magnitude and occur alongside several protective changes (exercise consistency, lower physiological resting rate, and lower self-reported stress/anxiety). Given the participant’s very low initial CES-D score (3/60) and the preponderance of indicators consistent with stable or slightly improved affective functioning, the balance of evidence supports that depressive symptom burden has not worsened; if anything it appears stable or slightly improved.

67709,7.0,"Multimodal summary — self-report and mood/anxiety: The participant’s baseline CES-D score (29/60; Z = 1.63) indicates an elevated level of depressive symptoms at the initial assessment. Since the previous wave, trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased markedly from 46 to 54 (Δ = +8; Z-Score delta = 1.27). The change in STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES-D change (0.72), so this substantial rise in chronic anxiety proneness is a robust indicator that depressive symptoms are likely to have increased. Self-esteem declined modestly (RSES 33 → 31; Δ = −2) and that change has a negative correlation with CES-D change (−0.48), which, given the direction of the self-esteem drop, is consistent with an association to worsening depressive symptoms. Perceived stress also increased (26 → 30; Δ = +4; Z-Score delta = 1.33) and shows a weak-to-moderate positive correlation with CES-D change (0.25), again pointing toward increased depressive burden. The initial CES-D score is moderately inversely correlated with change (−0.50), which statistically indicates subjects with higher initial scores often show reductions over time; however, that background tendency must be weighed against the currently observed increases in anxiety, stress, and falling self-esteem.

Sleep — subjective vs. wearable and variability: Self-reported habitual weekday sleep duration shifted dramatically downward (previously 7.0 h → reported 4.0 h; Δ = −3.0 h), and the participant now endorses an “ideal” weekday sleep of 6.0 h (down from 8.0 h), indicating both shorter perceived sleep and an acceptance of shorter sleep. The correlations linking these specific self-report sleep deltas to CES-D change are small, but other sleep-derived markers more strongly implicate instability. Wearable-derived median sleep duration decreased slightly (8 h 16 m → 8 h 6 m), while night-to-night variability increased substantially (SD 173 → 254 minutes; large Z change). Median sleep start time shifted earlier (approximately 3:45 AM → 2:52 AM), but start-time variability grew markedly (SD from 98 → 275 minutes). Increased variability in sleep timing and duration has a small-to-moderate positive association with CES-D change in these data (delta correlations ~0.17–0.23), and the combination of larger variability and the subjective report of much shorter weekday sleep is consistent with worsening sleep-related risk for depressive symptoms.

Behavioral activity and social/exercise habits: The participant shows notable reductions in physical activity: frequency of exercising alone dropped from weekly to monthly, and exercising with others declined from multiple times per week to monthly. These reductions in exercise are accompanied by increased sedentary recreational time (watching TV/videos) and little change in substance use (no use reported both waves). Declines in social or structured physical activity, particularly the large decreases in exercise with others, are behavioral changes commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms; the delta correlations for exercise items are small but the magnitude of change is notable. Academic indicators (GPA) show variability across terms but no clear improvement that might offset other negative behavioral trends.

Physiology and circadian rhythm (wearable heart-rate metrics): Aggregate heart-rate-based circadian metrics show an elevation in overall heart-rate level (Mesor +7.5) and amplitude (+1.84), along with an earlier acrophase (peak heart rate shifted from ~6:50 PM to ~5:17 PM). Resting heart rate increased modestly (52.8 → 56.2 bpm), and daytime hourly heart rates are elevated relative to the prior period at many hours (e.g., mid-day and afternoon increases of ~15–20 bpm at some hours). Interdaily stability edged up slightly and intradaily variability decreased modestly. The increases in mesor, amplitude, and daytime heart rate suggest increased daytime physiological arousal or activation and a change in autonomic tone; however, correlations between these circadian/HR deltas and CES-D change are small in the provided data (mostly near zero), so their direct relationship to depressive symptom change is uncertain. Still, the rise in resting heart rate and broadly higher daytime HR are consistent with concurrent increases in stress/anxiety reported on surveys.

Weighing evidence for worsening versus improvement or stability: Evidence pointing toward worsening of depressive symptoms is relatively strong in the self-report domain: a substantial increase in trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES-D change), increased perceived stress, decreased self-esteem, large declines in exercise frequency, increased sedentary recreation, and increased sleep timing/quantity instability. Several of these deltas have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D change (notably STAI Δ correlation = 0.72; self-esteem Δ correlation = −0.48 in the context of a decline). Physiological measures (higher resting HR, raised mesor/amplitude) and marked increases in sleep timing variability provide convergent support for elevated physiological arousal and disrupted sleep–wake patterns, both of which are commonly associated with increases in depressive symptoms even if their direct delta correlations here are small. Countervailing evidence for improvement is limited: wearable median sleep duration changed only slightly and median sleep start moved earlier (the latter has a moderate negative delta correlation with CES-D change, suggesting earlier sleep could be associated with improvement), and the initial CES-D’s negative correlation with change (−0.50) statistically biases toward a reduction over time. However, these signals are outweighed by the pronounced and correlated adverse trends in anxiety, stress, self-esteem, physical activity, and sleep regularity.

Integrated determination: On balance, the multimodal pattern—large increase in trait anxiety, increased stress, reduced self-esteem, decreased exercise and increased sedentary activity, and greater sleep timing and duration variability—aligns with a worsening of depressive symptom burden relative to the prior assessment. The single strongest predictor in the dataset (increase in STAI with high positive correlation to CES-D change) and multiple supporting indicators lead to the conclusion that depressive symptoms have likely increased.

36552,4.0,"Multimodal summary and overall pattern:
Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics, the participant presents a pattern more consistent with reduced momentary stress and modest behavioral stabilization compared with the prior wave. The initial CES-D score (10/60; Z = -0.34) indicates a relatively low baseline level of depressive symptoms. Several convergent signals point toward reduced negative affect and greater day-to-day regularity: self-reported global stress dropped markedly (24 → 15; delta = −9, Z-score of delta ≈ −1.47), the participant’s qualitative rating shifted from “pretty happy” to “Happy,” and reports of normal weekday sleep increased from 6 to 7 hours. Wearable markers show a lower cardiovascular set point (MESOR and resting heart rate decreased: resting HR 63.6 → 58.6 bpm), an earlier circadian acrophase (4:11 PM → 2:59 PM), and higher interdaily stability (0.35 → 0.43), consistent with more regular timing of daily physiology and lower tonic physiological arousal.

Evidence supporting improvement or stability in depressive burden:
The largest single change is the reduction in perceived stress, which is commonly associated with decreases in depressive symptom burden; the participant also reports being happier and shows behavioral shifts that often correlate with better mood (increased normal weekday sleep, reduced sleep latency from 15 to 5 minutes, earlier median sleep onset by ~3 hours, and increased socializing from ~30 minutes to 1–2 hours). Objective physiology is congruent: resting heart rate and MESOR fell substantially (resting HR −5 bpm; MESOR −6.4), suggesting lower baseline sympathetic arousal or improved cardiovascular fitness, both of which can accompany improved mood or lower stress. Interdaily stability improved, indicating more consistent daily structure across days, which typically supports mood regulation. Small increases in exercise with others and reduced solitary TV time also align with greater social engagement and behavioral activation.

Evidence for mixed or worsening signals:
There are a few signals that temper the conclusion of uniform improvement. Intradaily variability increased (0.76 → 0.86; high Z-score), indicating greater within-day fragmentation of activity which can reflect irregular activity/sleep bouts or more variable daytime behavior. Sleep duration remains modest (median ~6 h 29 min) with increased night-to-night variability in duration (SD increased from 49 to 79 minutes), and self-rated health satisfaction declined slightly (5.0 → 4.44). Self-esteem decreased modestly (40 → 38). These mixed indicators suggest some ongoing variability in daily physiology and subjective health perceptions even as stress and momentary mood improved.

Holistic interpretation regarding CES-D direction:
Balancing the evidence, the dominant and largest-magnitude changes are reductions in perceived stress and tonic physiological arousal, an earlier and more consistent sleep onset timing, increased reported sleep opportunity, and greater social engagement—factors that are robustly associated with decreases in depressive symptom burden. The mixed indicators (higher intradaily variability, small declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction, continued short median sleep duration) introduce caution but do not outweigh the larger, directional improvements in stress, affect, circadian timing, and resting physiology. Given the initial CES-D was already low, there is limited headroom for large CES-D reductions, but the pattern of changes supports either stability or a modest decrease in depressive symptoms rather than worsening.

63138,4.0,"Multimodal self-report summary:
Self-reported psychological measures show consistent, directionally positive change since the prior wave. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) declined from 40 to 36, moving the participant from a prior ""anxious"" classification to ""not anxious,"" and the stress score fell markedly from 23 to 14 (Delta = -9), indicating a substantial reduction in perceived stress. Rosenberg self-esteem increased substantially (38 → 45; Z-Score of Delta = 1.32), indicating a large upward shift in reported self-worth. Other self-report indices are largely stable or mildly positive: normal weekday sleep duration (self-report) increased by one hour, perceived control over sleep shifted from “Disagree” to “Somewhat Disagree,” and trust and socializing frequency are essentially unchanged. Health satisfaction showed a small decline (4.78 → 4.56), and screen-based leisure (watching videos, internet use) increased, but the dominant pattern in the survey data is lower anxiety/stress and higher self-esteem—changes that are typically associated with reduced depressive symptom burden.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian summary:
Cardiovascular and circadian metrics from the wearable indicate lower overall cardiovascular activation and an earlier, more consolidated circadian timing. Resting heart rate decreased by ~3.5 bpm (63.65 → 60.20) and the MESOR (cosinor mean) fell by ~8.1 bpm, consistent with lower mean daytime cardiac activity. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm decreased (12.94 → 10.35) and acrophase shifted earlier (about 5:32 PM → 3:57 PM), suggesting the daily peak in heart-rate-related activity occurs earlier in the day. Interdaily stability decreased slightly while autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (0.17 → 0.27), indicating mixed signals: modestly lower day-to-day regularity but improved 24-hour patterning. Intradaily variability remains relatively high (0.82 → 0.81), suggesting some within-day fragmentation persists. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles show substantially lower values across many daytime hours compared with the previous wave (notably lower late-afternoon/evening peaks), consistent with the overall drop in mesor and resting heart rate.

Sleep quantity, timing, and variability:
Objective sleep improved on several clinically relevant axes. Median nightly sleep duration increased from 8 h 21 m to 9 h (Delta ≈ +39 min; Z-Score 1.94 current), and median sleep start time shifted earlier by approximately 2 h 39 m (01:37 → 00:16), representing a meaningful earlier sleep onset. Sleep onset timing variability increased modestly (SD +14 minutes) and overall night-to-night variability in duration rose slightly (SD +4 minutes), but these variability changes are small relative to the increases in duration and earlier timing. Self-reported weekday sleep duration likewise increased (6 → 7 hours), aligning with wearable-recorded longer sleep. Earlier, longer sleep combined with lower resting heart rate suggests an overall recovery/normalization of nocturnal and diurnal physiology.

Behavioral activity and social factors:
Physical activity and social-exercise markers indicate increased engagement with others and more frequent sports/exercise. Frequency of exercising with others increased from monthly to weekly and sports/exercise frequency increased from monthly to weekly—changes that generally correlate with better mood. Substance use and socializing frequency are unchanged. Sedentary and screen-based leisure increased (watching videos increased more substantially), which is a mixed behavioral change: increased recreational screen time can be neutral or a risk factor depending on context, but it does not appear to coincide with elevated stress or anxiety in this wave. Academic performance (recent GPAs) remains high and stable.

Interpretation relative to depressive symptom change:
The initial CES-D score was low (8/60; Z = -0.55), indicating a relatively low depressive burden at baseline. Across modalities, the most salient signals point toward reduced affective distress and improved functioning: large decreases in perceived stress and trait anxiety, a strong increase in self-esteem, longer and earlier nocturnal sleep, reduced resting heart rate and mesor, increased frequency of social and team-based exercise, and stable or improved social behavior. Some ambivalent signals exist—decreased circadian amplitude and small increases in intra-night variability, plus more screen time and a small drop in health satisfaction—but these do not outweigh the consistent, sizable improvements in stress, anxiety, self-esteem, sleep duration/timing, and social exercise. Correlations provided with change deltas do not contradict this pattern and, where notable, the direction of change in self-report measures that commonly co-vary with depressive symptoms (stress, anxiety, self-esteem, sleep) aligns with symptomatic improvement.

Overall direction of depressive burden:
Considering the convergent evidence—substantial reductions in stress and trait anxiety, marked increase in self-esteem, objectively longer and earlier sleep, decreased resting heart rate and mean heart-rate levels, and increased social exercise—the balance of multimodal indicators supports a decrease or stabilization at a lower level of depressive symptoms relative to the prior wave. There are minor mixed indicators (circadian amplitude reduction, slightly increased sleep variability, more screen time), but they are small compared to the consistent improvements in affective and behavioral domains. Therefore the overall depressive symptom burden as measured by CES-D is best characterized as stable or decreased.

29134,-7.0,"Multimodal self-report summary:
Across the self-report measures the largest and most interpretable change is a substantial reduction in trait anxiety (STAI–Trait decreased by 7 points, from 38 to 31). The documented correlation between STAI change and CES-D change is large (0.72), and the observed STAI decrease therefore provides relatively strong evidence consistent with a reduction in depressive symptom burden. Perceived stress also decreased (21 → 18), a smaller change but one that aligns with the STAI pattern; the stress change has a modest positive correlation (0.26) with CES-D change, so the observed stress reduction is also consistent with improvement. Self-esteem was unchanged. Health satisfaction increased slightly. Some behavioral changes are mixed: weekday sleep duration as subjectively reported shortened by one hour (7 → 6 hours), while the participant’s stated “ideal” weekday sleep decreased by one hour; both of these had minimal correlations with CES-D change. Recreational/non-prescribed drug use increased from “not at all” to “less than 1–2 times a month,” but the correlation of that change with CES-D change is small. Taken together, the self-report domain shows several signals (notably decreased trait anxiety and lower stress, and slightly higher health satisfaction) that coherently point toward reduced depressive symptom burden, with a few small behavioral changes that could be neutral or risk-related but of modest effect size.

Wearable sleep and circadian physiology:
Objective sleep timing and duration show a mixture of improvement and increased variability. Median nightly sleep duration increased modestly (~16 minutes), and median sleep start time shifted earlier by about 1 hour and 10 minutes (from ~01:13 to ~00:23), with a substantial negative correlation between change in sleep start time and CES-D change (−0.41). Earlier and more consolidated sleep timing is typically associated with lower depressive symptoms in this dataset, so the earlier median sleep onset is consistent with improvement. Sleep start-time variability decreased (standard deviation of start time dropped by ~70 minutes), which also favors improved circadian regularity. In contrast, night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased substantially (SD increased from 159 to 210 minutes); this increase in duration variability is associated with a positive correlation (0.19) with CES-D change and therefore is a signal that would predict worsening symptoms. Overall, timing and earlier onset favor improvement, whereas greater variability in sleep amount is an adverse signal of modest magnitude.

Wearable heart-rate and circadian rhythm metrics:
Resting heart rate decreased modestly (61.0 → 58.6 bpm), and the MESOR/amplitude changes are small-to-moderate (mesor +0.26 bpm, amplitude +1.69 bpm). Non-parametric circadian indices show a small reduction in interdaily stability (0.42 → 0.36) and an increase in intraday variability (0.57 → 0.65). Increased intraday variability (greater fragmentation) has a small positive correlation with CES-D change (0.06) and therefore weakly favors a worsening signal, whereas the autocorrelation at 24 hours rose slightly (0.18 → 0.25). Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles indicate lower average rates overnight and modest changes across daytime hours; these physiological shifts are small and have negligible correlations with CES-D change in the provided summaries. In sum, cardiac-derived circadian measures include both small improvements (lower resting HR) and small degradations (greater intraday fragmentation, lower interdaily stability); their associations with CES-D change are weak compared with the strong STAI signal from self-report.

Integrated interpretation and weighing of evidence:
When the modalities are integrated, the clearest and strongest signal is the large decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) accompanied by a modest decrease in perceived stress and a small increase in health satisfaction — these three self-report indices all point in the same direction and have the most substantial associations with CES-D change in the provided correlation estimates. Objective sleep timing also shifted in a direction generally associated with lower depressive burden (earlier median sleep onset and reduced sleep-start variability), strengthening the “improvement” interpretation. Offsetting signals are present but smaller in magnitude: night-to-night sleep-duration variability increased (an adverse signal), intraday activity fragmentation increased slightly, and there was a small uptick in low-frequency recreational drug use. However, the adverse signals are generally smaller in magnitude and have weaker correlations with CES-D change than the STAI reduction and sleep-timing improvements.

Conclusion regarding direction of CES-D change:
Balancing the magnitude of changes and their reported correlations with CES-D change, the preponderance of evidence supports a net reduction or stabilization toward lower depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. The single strongest indicator (STAI decline, correlation 0.72) and supporting signals from stress and sleep timing outweigh smaller, mixed adverse signals. Therefore the overall CES-D direction is best characterized as stable_decrease.

24029,-18.0,"Self-report psychological measures and perceived stress show large, consistent improvements between waves. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) fell markedly (50 → 33), shifting classification from “anxious” to “not anxious”; this change has a large delta magnitude and a strong positive correlation (0.72) with CES‑D change, indicating the STAI reduction is tightly linked to reductions in depressive symptom change. Perceived stress likewise decreased substantially (30 → 17) and health satisfaction increased (3.67 → 5.22). Self‑esteem increased by a large amount (29 → 44). Taken together, these self‑report shifts point toward a pronounced reduction in internalizing distress and increased subjective well‑being relative to the prior wave.

Sleep and circadian/wearable rhythm metrics show objective consolidation and an overall shift in timing. Median nightly sleep increased by ~37 minutes and night‑to‑night variability decreased (SD fell from 102 to 66 minutes), indicating more sleep and less day‑to‑day irregularity. Non‑parametric circadian metrics also moved in a direction associated with improved rhythm structure: interdaily stability increased slightly and intradaily variability declined substantially (0.87 → 0.57), consistent with fewer abrupt within‑day fluctuations. Cosinor parameters indicate a later acrophase (peak of heart‑rate rhythm shifted from ~2:24 PM to ~5:06 PM) and a small increase in amplitude; mesor and resting heart rate remained essentially stable. These findings suggest the participant shifted daily activity/physiological peaks later in the day while achieving a more regular and less fragmented 24‑hour pattern overall.

Behavioral activity patterns present a mixed picture. Self‑reported physical activity and sports declined (from three+ times weekly to 1–2 times or none), and time spent playing video games increased substantially (>4 hours), indicating greater sedentary leisure. Conversely, time socializing increased modestly and reading increased; listening to music decreased. BMI remained unchanged. The wearable aggregated hourly heart‑rate profiles show higher mean heart rates in many evening/night hours in the current wave compared with the prior wave and the acrophase shift consistent with later evening physiological activation — patterns that align with later bedtimes and greater evening activity. Thus, while social contact and some sedentary cognitive/leisure activity rose, engagement in structured exercise fell.

Weighing evidence for change in depressive symptom burden: evidence consistent with a decrease in depressive burden (improvement) is strong and multimodal—large decreases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, a large increase in self‑esteem, higher health satisfaction, objective sleep gains (longer median sleep and lower variability), and more consolidated circadian rhythms. Several of these measures (STAI delta, stress, self‑esteem) are strongly associated with CES‑D change in the auxiliary correlations provided. Evidence that could indicate worsening or risk for poorer mood is more circumscribed: a substantial delay in sleep timing (~3 hours later bedtime), reduced frequency of exercise and sports, increased sedentary video game time, and later evening physiological activation. These factors can be associated with worse mood over time but occurred alongside improvements in core affective and stress measures. On balance, the pattern is dominated by large, direct indicators of reduced affective distress and improved subjective well‑being, supported by objective gains in sleep regularity and circadian consolidation. The net evidence indicates a reduction, or at minimum not an increase, in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

49086,6.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological analysis:
The self-report data indicate modest favorable changes in several psychosocial domains. Perceived stress decreased substantially (from 23 to 18), and self-rated health satisfaction increased markedly (from 3.33 to 4.89), both changes of meaningful magnitude in the context of the study Z-scores. Self-esteem remained high and stable. Academic performance indicators (GPA) remained strong. Social behavior shows a small reduction in time spent socializing with friends (from 2–3 hours to 1–2 hours), and some leisure activities that are sedentary (watching TV, “sedentary hobby”) decreased or ceased; exercise-related behaviors increased (sports reported at 1–2 times per week where previously none, and some increase in exercising alone). Taken together, self-report suggests reduced perceived stress, improved health satisfaction, maintained self-esteem, increased purposeful physical activity, but slightly reduced in-person social time and a small rise in trait anxiety (STAI +2 points) that remains in the non-anxious range.

Sleep and circadian/rhythm measures show overall stabilization and modest improvement in sleep quantity and timing. Median nightly sleep increased by about 18 minutes (7:18 → 7:37) and night-to-night variability of sleep duration decreased (SD from 107 to 81 minutes). Sleep start times shifted only slightly later (~9 minutes) while start-time variability narrowed substantially (SD from 78 to 49 minutes). These changes indicate more regular, slightly longer nocturnal sleep. Wearable-derived circadian features show a mixed but generally more robust entrainment: interdaily stability increased (0.41 → 0.47) and amplitude from cosinor analysis rose notably (8.73 → 13.14), suggesting stronger daily modulation of heart-rate rhythms; concurrently, mesor decreased (70.39 → 62.31) and acrophase shifted later (≈5:00 PM → 6:27 PM). Increased intradaily variability (0.54 → 0.64) is a countervailing signal consistent with more fragmentation during the day, but the combination of greater amplitude, improved interdaily stability, and reduced sleep variability points overall toward tighter, more regular sleep–wake structure.

Cardiovascular physiology indicates a pronounced lowering of baseline autonomic activity. Resting heart rate fell markedly (−10.7 bpm; 56.8 → 46.1), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows generally lower heart rates across night and many daytime hours relative to the previous wave. The large drop in resting heart rate and lower mesor could reflect improved cardiovascular fitness, decreased tonic sympathetic arousal, or differences in measurement context; the increase in amplitude suggests a larger day–night contrast in heart-rate levels. These physiological changes, along with reduced self-reported stress and increased exercise, are consistent with an overall reduction in sustained physiological arousal.

Synthesis with respect to depressive symptom burden:
Direct CES-D scores in the follow-up wave are not provided; the initial CES-D was very low (1/60, z ≈ −1.28). Indicators consistent with decreased depressive burden include the substantial reduction in perceived stress, greater health satisfaction, modestly increased and more regular sleep, increased physical activity, lower resting heart rate, and stronger circadian amplitude/interdaily stability. These are well-aligned with patterns typically associated with lower depressive symptom severity. Evidence that might point toward increased risk (or countervail improvement) is limited: a small rise in trait anxiety (STAI +2) and reduced time socializing; intradaily variability increased, which can reflect more daytime fragmentation. However, the magnitude and direction of the dominant signals (stress down, health satisfaction up, sleep more regular, increased exercise, large RHR decrease, and stronger circadian amplitude) outweigh these smaller adverse signals.

Overall directional assessment:
Balancing the multimodal evidence, the preponderance of behavioral, subjective, and physiological changes indicates stability or improvement rather than worsening of depressive symptom burden. There are small, isolated signals that could merit monitoring (modest STAI increase, reduced socializing, increased intradaily variability), but the larger-magnitude changes—reduced stress, improved health satisfaction, better sleep regularity, increased activity, and marked reduction in resting heart rate—support an interpretation of stable-to-improved depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave.

95490,-2.0,"Multimodal behavioral and physiological synthesis:
The psychometric profile shows several clear shifts consistent with reduced internalizing symptoms across self-report measures. Trait anxiety on the STAI fell substantially (47 → 38), a large drop whose change is strongly positively correlated with concurrent changes in CES-D within the sample (delta-correlation = +0.72). Rosenberg self‑esteem increased (34 → 38), and this increase aligns with sample-level relationships linking higher self‑esteem to reductions in CES‑D (delta-correlation = −0.48). Perceived stress changed only minimally downward (23 → 22) and in the same direction as expected improvement in CES‑D given the modest positive delta-correlation (0.26). Together, these directional changes in anxiety, self‑esteem and stress provide convergent self-report evidence that mood-related burden has lessened since the prior wave.

Sleep and sleep perception show mixed but largely favorable objective changes. Wearable-derived sleep duration increased markedly (median from ~6 h 56 m to ~9 h 5 m; +2 h 8 m, large positive Z change), and sleep onset shifted slightly earlier with reduced night-to-night variability in start time. These objective increases in total sleep opportunity and somewhat more consistent bedtime timing are typically associated with symptom improvement; the delta correlations for sleep-duration change are small but positive (0.11), offering weak consistent support for CES‑D improvement. In contrast, self‑reported “normal weekday sleep duration” decreased by one hour (6 → 5 hours), suggesting a divergence between subjective sleep habit report and the wearable-recorded epoch; this inconsistency should be noted but does not outweigh the large objective sleep increase.

Activity, social and substance-behavior changes are mixed and include some potential risk signals. Frequency of exercise declined (especially exercising alone, from ≥3×/week to 1–2×/week), and socializing time decreased (2–3 hours → 1–2 hours); both changes are behavioral risk factors for worsening mood but their sample-level delta-correlations with CES‑D are small (near zero). Recreational drug use increased from “not at all” to “less than 1–2 times a month,” but this change is infrequent and shows a minimal sample-level relation to CES‑D change. Overall, reductions in activity and social contact represent observable countervailing trends that could limit or slow mood improvement despite other positive signals.

Cardiovascular and circadian physiology present a more complex picture. Resting heart rate increased appreciably (61.4 → 68.8 bpm), and the cosinor results indicate a higher MESOR with markedly reduced amplitude (baseline elevated, diurnal variation blunted). Aggregated hourly heart rate values are broadly higher across daytime and many nocturnal hours compared with the prior wave. Elevated resting heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude can reflect increased physiological arousal or reduced autonomic/behavioral regulation and are potential markers of physiological stress; however, the sample-level correlations between these physiological deltas and CES‑D change are small. Non-parametric rhythm measures (interdaily stability, intradaily variability) are largely unchanged or slightly improved (lower intradaily variability), indicating neither a strongly destabilized nor clearly more regular daily rest-activity rhythm overall. Taken together, physiology supplies cautionary signals (higher resting HR, reduced amplitude) but not strong, convergent evidence of worsening depressive burden.

Evidence for worsening CES‑D (increase):
There are limited signals that could indicate worsening depressive burden: decreased exercise frequency and reduced social time are behavioral risk factors for increased depressive symptoms, and cardiovascular markers (increased resting heart rate, higher MESOR and lower circadian amplitude) point to greater physiological arousal and blunted daily variation, which can accompany worsening mood. Recreational drug use shows a small increase. However, these signals either have small delta-correlations with CES‑D in the sample or are modest in magnitude relative to other changes.

Evidence for improvement or stability in CES‑D (decrease/stable):
Stronger evidence supports an improvement or stability in depressive burden. The large reduction in trait anxiety (STAI) and the increase in self‑esteem are both psychometrically and conceptually linked to reductions in depressive symptoms, and their change correlations with CES‑D are moderate-to-large and in the direction consistent with CES‑D improvement. Objective sleep increased substantially in duration and became somewhat more regular in bedtime, a change commonly associated with symptom reduction. Perceived stress decreased slightly. These converging self-report and objective sleep changes provide more direct and larger-magnitude signals of improvement than the mixed physiological or activity-based risk markers.

Overall directional assessment:
Balancing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most coherent signals (large decrease in trait anxiety, increase in self‑esteem, and substantial objective increase in sleep duration) point toward a reduction or stabilization of depressive symptom burden since the prior wave. Physiological indicators (higher resting HR, lower circadian amplitude) and reductions in exercise/socializing introduce some risk and warrant monitoring, but they are smaller in predictive weight here and show weak correlations with CES‑D change in the sample. In sum, the preponderance of available evidence supports that the participant’s CES‑D-related burden has not worsened and is most consistent with being stable or improved.

22842,2.0,"Task 1 — Multimodal behavioral and physiological analysis

Self-report measures indicate a mixed pattern of change with several signals consistent with increased depressive burden. The participant’s baseline CES-D score (20/60, Z = 0.7) is in the elevated range. Trait anxiety (STAI) is essentially unchanged (46 → 45), while self-esteem shows a substantive decline (RSES 36 → 32), and global health satisfaction decreases (5.44 → 4.67). Reported stress is minimally lower (22 → 21) and current subjective happiness is unchanged, but reductions in self-esteem and health satisfaction are notable because lowered self-esteem and poorer perceived health are commonly associated with increases in depressive symptoms.

Objective sleep and sleep-related self-report show clear deterioration. Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration fell from 7 h 51 min to 6 h 40 min (a decrease of ~2 h 49 min), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration increased (SD 133 → 177 minutes). The participant’s desired weekday sleep increased (reports wanting 9 h now vs 7 h previously) and sleep latency remains long (45 minutes), suggesting a mismatch between desired and obtained sleep. Median sleep start time shifted slightly later (≈12 minutes later) and start-time variability decreased somewhat, but the large drop in total sleep time together with increased duration variability indicates clinically meaningful sleep disruption and sleep debt accumulation—all patterns that frequently co-occur with worsening depressive symptoms.

Wearable circadian and heart-rate metrics point toward greater circadian fragmentation and reduced amplitude of physiological rhythms. Non-parametric rhythm metrics show higher intradaily variability (0.48 → 0.58) while interdaily stability is unchanged; 24-hour autocorrelation declined (0.31 → 0.24). Cosinor-derived features show decreases in MESOR (mean heart rate; 68.69 → 62.68) and amplitude (11.44 → 9.61), and resting heart rate decreased modestly (54.2 → 51.6 bpm). The pattern—reduced rhythmic amplitude and lower 24-hour regularity coupled with increased within-day variability—suggests a less robust and more fragmented circadian organization of physiology. These circadian changes are often linked to worsening mood or affective dysregulation, even when resting heart rate itself is lower.

Behavioral activity and social measures complement the physiological picture. Exercise frequency has been maintained (exercising alone three times per week or more), which is a potentially stabilizing factor. However, social activity declined (time socializing reduced from 1–2 hours to about 31 minutes per hour), internet usage increased (1–2 hours → 2–3 hours), and alcohol use (beer) increased slightly in frequency. Together with declines in self-esteem and health satisfaction, reduced social engagement and increased sedentary or screen-based behavior are behavioral changes that commonly align with increases in depressive symptom burden.

Integration and implications for depressive change. Several convergent indicators—large objective reduction in sleep duration with increased variability, increased intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour rhythm strength, decreased self-esteem and health satisfaction, and reduced social engagement—cohere as signals consistent with a worsening of depressive symptomatology relative to the previous assessment wave. Some measures run counter to that pattern (small decreases in reported stress and trait anxiety; stable exercise frequency; modest lowering of resting heart rate which could reflect improved cardiovascular fitness), but these are relatively small in magnitude compared with the larger, more consistent changes in sleep, circadian rhythm stability, self-esteem, and social behavior. Correlations provided in the data were used as contextual guides but do not overturn the multimodal convergence above.

Task 2 — Overall direction of change in depressive burden

Evidence for worsening (increase): Marked objective sleep loss (~2 h 49 min reduction in median sleep), increased sleep duration variability, increased intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation of heart-rate rhythms, decreased circadian amplitude (MESOR and amplitude reductions), loss of self-esteem, reduced health satisfaction, and decreased social engagement all point toward an increased depressive symptom burden. These changes are large in magnitude and consistent across both behavioral and physiological domains.

Evidence for improvement or stability: Minor decreases in self-reported stress and trait anxiety, and stable exercise frequency, provide limited evidence toward stability or small improvement in some domains. Lower resting heart rate could reflect better fitness but is small in magnitude and occurs alongside reductions in circadian amplitude and rhythm regularity, limiting its interpretation as an indicator of improved mood.

Holistic conclusion: On balance, the preponderance of multimodal evidence—particularly the large objective deterioration in sleep, increased circadian fragmentation, reductions in self-esteem and health satisfaction, and decreased social activity—supports an overall worsening in depressive symptom burden since the prior wave.

14279,19.0,"Multimodal psychological and behavioral synthesis:

Over the two-year interval the participant shows a notable increase in trait anxiety alongside small shifts in other self-report affective measures. Trait anxiety (STAI) rose by 9 points (38 → 47), moving the participant from a non-anxious classification into the ""anxious"" range; this change has a large positive correlation (0.72) with change in CES-D in the study sample, indicating that the STAI increase is a strong predictor of concurrent increases in depressive symptoms. Self-esteem declined modestly (40 → 38; Δ = -2) with a moderate negative correlation to CES-D change (-0.48), such that the drop in self-esteem aligns with risk for increasing depressive burden. Perceived stress increased by 3 points (20 → 23), a smaller effect but in the direction that typically accompanies worsening mood. The participant’s baseline CES-D was low (5/60, Z = -0.86), which provides a low starting anchor; the provided correlation of baseline CES-D with subsequent change (-0.5) suggests regression effects in the sample but does not outweigh the substantive trait-anxiety and self-esteem changes observed here.

Objective sleep timing and duration changed in directions that typically indicate improved sleep regularity. Median nightly sleep duration increased by about 49 minutes (from ~8 h 11 m to 9 h 0 m; Z-Score increase 0.81) and night-to-night variability decreased substantially (sleep-duration SD reduced from 93 to 49 minutes). Median sleep start time shifted earlier by ~1 hour 47 minutes and its variability also decreased. These Fitbit-derived improvements are mirrored by self-report increases in ""normal weekday sleep duration"" (7 → 9 hours). Correlations supplied between sleep deltas and CES-D change are close to zero, indicating that, in this dataset, the sleep improvements are only weakly associated with depressive symptom change. Thus the sleep data provide evidence of healthier and more regular sleep but do not strongly predict CES-D trajectory in this participant.

Cardiovascular and circadian rhythm measures show mixed signals. Resting heart rate increased modestly (59.2 → 61.2 bpm; Δ = +2 bpm). Hourly aggregated heart-rate profiles indicate lower extremes of daytime peaks relative to the previous wave and lower nighttime heart rates at some hours, consistent with an overall downward shift in amplitude of daily heart-rate variation. Cosinor-derived amplitude decreased (~12.98 → 10.94) and MESOR decreased slightly (77.75 → 74.44), while autocorrelation at 24 hours increased (0.32 → 0.41). Decreased amplitude can reflect blunted daily physiological variation, a pattern that has been associated in some studies with mood disturbance; however, the increase in 24-hour autocorrelation indicates more consistent day-to-day rhythm. Intradaily variability remained elevated (current 0.72, Z ≈ 0.86), suggesting some fragmentation within days. Taken together, physiology/circadian metrics show modest signs of reduced rhythm amplitude with slightly improved day-to-day regularity, a mixed picture with small effect sizes.

Behavioral and social activity changes largely point toward reduced social engagement and group-based exercise. Reported time socializing declined (previously 1–2 hours → currently ~31 minutes/hour), and frequency of exercising with others dropped from 1–2 times/week to not at all (a large negative delta). Individual exercise frequency and solitary recreation did not increase to offset the loss of social exercise. Alcohol use (beer) increased slightly. Daily leisure activities such as internet use and video games decreased, while listening to music increased. Trust scores remain low and unchanged. Reduced social contact and the loss of group exercise are behavioral patterns that commonly co-occur with increases in depressive symptoms and are plausibly relevant to CES-D changes; in this dataset the exercise-with-others drop is one of the larger behavioral deltas observed.

Holistic integration and directional inference about CES-D change:

Weighing the multimodal signals, there is a notable convergence of psychosocial risk indicators that are strongly associated with increasing depressive symptoms in the study correlations: a substantial rise in trait anxiety (STAI +9; correlation with CES-D change = 0.72) and a modest decline in self-esteem (correlation = -0.48) are the most salient affective predictors of CES-D worsening. Behavioral indicators that commonly accompany increased depressive burden—reduced socializing and cessation of exercising with others—are also present and of appreciable magnitude. Physiological and circadian data are mixed: objective sleep improved markedly (longer, more regular sleep) and day-to-day regularity increased (autocorrelation), which are protective or indicative of improved rest but carry very small correlations with CES-D change in this sample. Conversely, reduced circadian amplitude and slightly higher intradaily variability and resting heart rate are small physiological shifts that could align with greater symptom burden, but effect sizes are modest.

On balance, the largest and most strongly CES-D–linked changes (notably the STAI increase and the drop in self-esteem plus decreased social/exercise engagement) point toward an increase in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Protective signals from improved sleep and greater day-to-day rhythm regularity are present but have weak associations with CES-D change in the available correlations and do not fully counterbalance the anxiety, self-esteem, and social-behavioral changes. Therefore the overall directional assessment is toward an increase in depressive symptom burden.

52302,3.0,"Multimodal summary of self-report measures and behavioral changes:
Across self-report instruments the participant shows several notable improvements in affective and trait-level indicators. Trait anxiety on the STAI decreased substantially (43.0 → 33.0; Z-score change ≈ -1.04), and perceived stress fell markedly (21 → 12; Z-score of delta ≈ -1.47). Self‑esteem improved modestly (39 → 43) and the participant’s self-reported overall mood shifted from “happy” to “pretty happy.” Trust in others also increased. These changes are large in magnitude for anxiety and stress, and the STAI change has a strong positive correlation (0.72) with change in CES‑D in the study sample, indicating that reductions in anxiety in this participant are the kind of change that, in this cohort, are associated with reductions in depressive symptoms. Adverse self-report signals are present but smaller: health satisfaction declined (4.44 → 3.67) and alcohol use increased from “not at all” to “1–2 times a week,” while recreational and non‑prescribed drug use remained nil. Overall, the self-report profile shows clear improvement on multiple affective indices (anxiety, stress, self‑esteem, subjective happiness) with a few isolated negative changes related to health satisfaction and alcohol consumption.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures:
Wearable sleep and circadian metrics indicate consolidation and greater regularity of circadian physiology alongside a modest shift in sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration recorded by the device is within the typical range (current median ≈ 7 h 43 m versus previous ≈ 8 h 6 m), representing a small decrease in total sleep time. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration decreased substantially (SD 68 min current vs 123 min previous), and sleep start times are later on average (median start ≈ 01:56 current vs 01:07 previous), with reduced variability in sleep onset. Circadian rhythm summaries derived from heart rate show increased interdaily stability (0.33 → 0.61) and higher amplitude, and autocorrelation at 24 hours increased; intradaily variability decreased slightly. Resting heart rate remained stable. Together these wearable findings suggest a more regular, higher-amplitude diurnal pattern despite a modest delay in sleep timing and a small reduction in average sleep minutes. The decrease in sleep variability and increased interdaily stability are changes that, within the cohort, tend to co-occur with reductions in depressive symptoms (small positive delta correlations reported for stability/variability metrics imply that decreased variability and increased stability are aligned with CES‑D decreases in this sample).

Physiological hour‑by‑hour patterning and interpretation:
Aggregated hourly heart rate profiles show preserved low resting values in early morning hours and somewhat shifted daytime peaks compared with the prior wave; resting heart rate itself is essentially unchanged. Increased cosinor amplitude alongside greater interdaily stability points to a more robust and regular circadian heart‑rate rhythm. There are no wearable signs of elevated nocturnal physiological arousal (resting HR stable, early-morning hourly HR values not elevated), which would otherwise be expected with worsening depressive burden. These physiological changes are modest in magnitude but consistent with improved circadian organization rather than deterioration.

Weighing evidence for worsening depressive burden:
Signals that could reflect increased depressive risk are limited and relatively small in magnitude. Health satisfaction declined and sleep latency (self‑reported) is longer (40 min vs 20 min previously), and alcohol use increased from none to occasional weekly use. The delta correlations associated with these specific changes are small or mixed in direction in the study sample, and their magnitudes are smaller than the changes observed for anxiety and stress. There is no marked increase in physiological arousal, no large increase in daily activity fragmentation, and no sizable decrease in socialization or exercise frequency that would strongly indicate worsening depressive symptoms.

Weighing evidence for improvement or stability in depressive burden:
Multiple substantial within‑participant improvements point toward reduced depressive symptom burden: large decreases in trait anxiety and perceived stress, a measurable increase in self‑esteem, improved trust, more positive self-reported mood, and stronger circadian regularity and lower sleep variability. The change in STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D change in the cohort (0.72), and the direction of this participant’s STAI and stress changes is aligned with CES‑D decreases. The wearable circadian changes (increased interdaily stability and amplitude with reduced intradaily variability) are likewise consistent with physiological patterns often associated with reduced depressive symptoms.

Holistic conclusion:
Considering the magnitude and consistency of affective self‑report improvements (large reductions in anxiety and stress, increased self‑esteem and reported happiness), the circadian consolidation observed in wearable metrics (greater interdaily stability, higher amplitude, reduced sleep variability), and the absence of strong physiological or behavioral signals of deterioration, the preponderance of evidence supports a decrease or stabilization (improvement or no meaningful change) in depressive symptom burden relative to the prior wave. Small negative signals (reduced health satisfaction, later bedtimes, increased alcohol use, longer subjective sleep latency) are present but are smaller in magnitude and less consistently associated with CES‑D worsening in the cohort. The participant’s baseline CES‑D score was low (7/60), and the pattern of multimodal changes is most consistent with either stability at low levels or further modest improvement rather than worsening.

77789,-7.0,"Multimodal psychological profile — self-report and trait measures:
The participant’s self-report profile shows a mixture of improvement in positive self-evaluations and modest increases in proximal stress. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) is unchanged at 43 (stable “anxious” classification), while Rosenberg Self-Esteem rose from 36 to 39 (a meaningful positive shift; Z-score change ~0.58). Health satisfaction also increased substantially (from 3.11 to 4.33, Z-change ≈ 1.08). These upward moves in self-esteem and perceived health are commonly associated with reduced depressive symptom burden. In contrast, perceived stress increased modestly (20 → 22), and interpersonal trust declined slightly; these changes represent potential sources of risk but are numerically smaller than the increases in self-esteem and health satisfaction. Overall, the self-report domain shows stronger signals of improved self-regard and health appraisal than of worsening affective state.

Behavioral activity and lifestyle:
Behavioral data indicate increased engagement in some active behaviors and increased engagement in certain risk behaviors. Frequency of exercising alone increased (from 1–2 times/month to 1–2 times/week), and socializing time remained stable, both patterns that typically align with improved mood regulation. However, alcohol use increased notably (beer and liquor moved from monthly to weekly use; the delta Z for beer usage is large), and daily internet use rose. Reading time decreased to none. The pattern is therefore mixed: more regular exercise and stable social contact suggest protective behavioral change, while the marked increase in alcohol consumption and internet time are risk-relevant behaviors that could offset some benefits.

Objective sleep and sleep-related perceptions:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show improved regularity and modestly increased duration. Median nightly sleep duration increased by ~25 minutes (6:32 → 6:58 median), while night-to-night variability halved (sleep duration SD decreased from 166 min to 83 min; Z-change ~ -1.87), indicating substantially more consistent sleep. Median sleep start time shifted earlier (previously ~01:19 to ~00:18), and the participant reports greater perceived control over sleep duration. These objective and subjective improvements in sleep timing, stability, and perceived control are generally associated with decreased depressive symptoms and better daytime functioning.

Cardiovascular and circadian physiology:
Cardiac and circadian measures show clearer signs of reduced physiological arousal and greater circadian regularity. Resting heart rate decreased substantially (70.4 → 62.6 bpm; delta −7.8 bpm, large negative Z-change), and overall MESOR declined while amplitude increased, indicating a lower baseline heart rate with preserved or enhanced day–night contrast. Interdaily stability increased (0.55 → 0.60; Z ~1.31), intradaily variability remained low, and autocorrelation at 24 hours rose slightly — together suggesting a more robust and regular circadian structure. Aggregated hourly heart rates are lower across many hours compared to the prior period, consistent with the lower resting HR. These physiological patterns (lower resting HR, greater circadian stability, reduced sleep variability) align with improved regulation and are typically correlated with reductions in depressive symptom burden.

Integration and interpretation of competing signals:
Taken together, multiple modalities converge on improvement-related signals: increased self-esteem and health satisfaction, more frequent exercise, objectively longer and far more regular sleep, earlier sleep timing, lower resting heart rate, and stronger circadian stability. These changes are substantial in magnitude for several metrics (notably sleep variability, resting HR, and health satisfaction). Countervailing signals include a small increase in perceived stress and a notable uptick in alcohol use and internet time, which introduce some risk for mood worsening. Trait anxiety remained unchanged. Overall, the preponderance of evidence across self-report, behavioral, sleep, and physiological domains indicates net movement toward improved regulation and lower depressive burden rather than worsening.

Conclusion — direction of change in CES-D burden:
Considering the balance of improvements in self-esteem, sleep regularity, physical activity, health satisfaction, reduced resting heart rate, and stronger circadian stability versus smaller increases in stress and alcohol use, the multimodal evidence favors a decrease or stable-to-decreasing change in depressive symptom burden as measured by CES-D.

88882,2.0,"Multimodal summary — behavioral and physiological: Wearable-derived metrics indicate modest, consistent improvements in sleep quantity and circadian regularity between waves. Median nightly sleep increased by ~34 minutes (from about 5:57 to 6:31), sleep timing shifted slightly later (median sleep onset ~21 minutes later) with increased night-to-night variability, and sleep onset control moved from “somewhat disagree” to “somewhat agree” on the self-report item. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show improved structure: interdaily stability rose (0.33 → 0.40), intradaily variability fell (0.59 → 0.47), and 24-hour autocorrelation increased (0.22 → 0.37). Resting heart rate moved slightly downward (47.6 → 46.0 bpm) and cosinor parameters are essentially stable (small changes in mesor and amplitude). Together these patterns suggest greater day-to-day regularity in activity/physiology and modestly increased objective sleep duration relative to the prior wave.

Self-report and behavioral context: Self-report measures are mixed. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) increased by 3 points (28 → 31) but remains in the “not anxious” range; perceived stress decreased slightly (18 → 17). Self-esteem shows a small decline (score down by 2 points), and the participant reported being “very happy” previously and “pretty happy” currently; these indicate small shifts in subjective well-being. Health satisfaction shows a notable decrease (from 5.0 to 3.56, Z-score of the change ≈ -1.38), which is the largest self-report deterioration observed and may reflect concerns about physical health or overall well-being not captured by objective measures. Substance use is largely stable although wine/liquor frequency increased from monthly to 1–2 times per week; exercise frequency is unchanged. Academic performance (GPA) remains high. Overall, subjective mood and self-evaluative measures show small-to-moderate declines in some domains (health satisfaction, happiness, self-esteem), while stress and several lifestyle behaviors are stable or mildly improved.

Physiology and hourly heart rate profile: Aggregated hourly heart rate values show modest shifts at specific hours but no clear pattern of sustained physiological arousal during the day; the participant’s resting heart rate is low relative to the sample and decreased slightly across waves. The improved interdaily stability and lower intradaily variability argue for greater regularity in daily physiological rhythms, which is typically associated with more stable mood and lower depressive symptom burden. There is an acrophase (peak) shift later in the day (from ~5:43 PM to ~6:32 PM), consistent with a later daily activity or alertness peak, aligning with later sleep timing.

Synthesis of signals relevant to CES-D change: Evidence consistent with reduced depressive burden includes longer objective sleep duration, improved circadian regularity (higher interdaily stability, lower intradaily variability, higher 24-hour autocorrelation), slightly reduced resting heart rate, and a small reduction in perceived stress. Evidence consistent with increased depressive burden includes declines in self-rated health satisfaction (notable magnitude), a small drop in happiness and self-esteem, a modest rise in trait anxiety, and a small increase in alcohol frequency. The participant’s initial CES-D was very low (2/60), limiting the room for further large improvements and making small subjective declines more salient relative to a floor effect. Correlations provided are generally small for most deltas; the strongest single correlation in the table links increases in trait anxiety to CES-D change, but trait anxiety remains low overall.

Overall directional judgment: Balancing objective wearable-derived improvements in sleep and circadian regularity against modest declines in several subjective well-being indicators, the preponderance of physiological and behavioral signals points toward stability or slight improvement in factors commonly associated with depressive symptomatology. The large drop in self-reported health satisfaction and small declines in happiness and self-esteem temper that conclusion, but these subjective changes are not accompanied by worsening in stress, activity regularity, sleep duration, or resting physiology. Given the initial CES-D score was very low and objective markers improved, the most parsimonious overall assessment is that the participant’s depressive symptom burden has remained stable or decreased rather than worsened.

63347,-1.0,"Multimodal psychological summary — self-report measures:
Across survey waves the participant shows several clear improvements in symptom-relevant self-report measures. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) decreased by 10 points (from 45 to 35), shifting classification from “anxious” to “not anxious”; the standardized change is large (Z-score of delta ≈ -1.04) and the change in STAI has a strong positive correlation (0.72) with change in CES-D in the dataset, making this a salient indicator that depressive symptom burden likely moved in the same direction as the anxiety decrease. Perceived stress also decreased (21 → 17; Δ = -4), and the participant reports slightly greater trust and stable health satisfaction. Self-esteem shows only a minimal decline (40 → 39), a small change unlikely to outweigh the larger anxiety and stress improvements. Subjective mood labeling shifted from “happy” to “pretty happy” by wording, but the other self-report indices (notably large reductions in anxiety and stress) point toward decreased affective distress overall.

Sleep and circadian organization:
Objective sleep and circadian measures from the wearable indicate substantial improvement in sleep quantity and regularity. Median nightly sleep duration increased markedly (≈1 hour 48 minutes; from ~6h49m to ~8h37m; Z-score delta ≈ +1.98) and night-to-night variability decreased (SD down from 151 to 96 minutes). Sleep onset moved earlier by about 1 hour 7 minutes and its variability also declined. Non-parametric rhythm metrics show markedly greater interdaily stability (0.51 → 0.71; Z-score now ≈ +2.26) and higher autocorrelation at 24 h, while intradaily variability decreased slightly. These changes represent a stronger, more regular circadian structure and more consolidated, longer sleep — patterns that are generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden and with better daytime functioning.

Physiological arousal patterns:
Cardiovascular indicators show mixed but interpretable shifts. Resting heart rate increased from 52.3 to 57.8 bpm (Δ ≈ +5.5 bpm; Z-score of delta ≈ +1.21), which by itself can reflect several factors (fitness, autonomic state, medication, or measurement context) and is only weakly correlated with CES-D change in the supplied data. Aggregated hourly heart-rate profiles indicate lower late-evening peaks compared with the previous wave (e.g., very high 7–8 pm values previously reduced now), and slightly lower overnight heart rates around the early morning hours; collectively these changes suggest reduced evening physiological hyperarousal and somewhat calmer overnight physiology despite the modest increase in resting HR. Cosinor parameters (mesor down slightly, amplitude essentially stable) alongside stronger interdaily stability support a more regular daily physiological rhythm.

Behavioral and lifestyle change:
Behavioral data show increased social and physical activity: frequency of exercising with others increased substantially (from “not at all” to “three times a week or more”), and exercising alone increased slightly. BMI decreased from 28.69 to 25.11 (Δ ≈ -3.6), consistent with greater activity and/or improved health behaviors. Alcohol consumption increased from less-than-monthly to 1–2 times per week for both beer and wine/liquor; recreational and non-prescribed drug use remained absent. Daily recreation habits show small increases in passive media use and internet time, but socializing time is stable. The increase in social exercise and the BMI/fitness indicators are consistent with improved behavioral activation and social engagement—factors typically associated with reductions in depressive symptoms—while the increase in weekly alcohol use is a potential countervailing behavioral risk but has a small correlation with CES-D change in the provided data.

Synthesis and evidence weighing for CES-D change:
Multiple, independent indicators point toward a reduction in depressive burden relative to the prior wave. The largest and most directly relevant signals are: (1) a large decrease in trait anxiety (STAI) with a strong positive correlation to CES-D change, (2) decreased perceived stress, (3) large gains in objective sleep duration and sleep regularity (substantial Z-score increases in sleep duration and interdaily stability), and (4) increased social exercise and improved weight status. Physiological rhythm measures corroborate these improvements by showing greater circadian regularity and reduced evening heart-rate peaks. Countervailing signals are limited: resting heart rate increased modestly and self-esteem changed only minimally in the negative direction; weekly alcohol consumption rose, but its delta correlation with CES-D change is small in the dataset. Taken holistically, the preponderance of strong, converging evidence from anxiety, stress, sleep quantity/regularity, activity, and circadian organization supports a net decrease (improvement) in depressive symptom burden compared with the prior recording.

Final determination:
Given the weight of behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived physiological evidence indicating reduced anxiety and stress, substantially improved sleep duration and regularity, and increased social/physical activity, the overall CES-D burden is best characterized as decreased or stable-to-decreased relative to the previous wave.
