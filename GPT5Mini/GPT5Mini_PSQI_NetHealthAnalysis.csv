44869,"Summary of available data and analytic approach: The provided data combine self-report measures (mood, stress, lifestyle) with wearable-derived sleep and heart-rate circadian metrics collected across an academic semester. In weighing contributors to sleep quality I prioritized variables with larger effect sizes or z-scores (relative to the study sample) and variables that show moderate correlations with PSQI in the sample (noting these correlations as guides rather than causal proof). Below I separately describe evidence that points toward poorer sleep (higher PSQI) and evidence that points toward better sleep (lower PSQI), then integrate physiological circadian findings and present an overall comparison to the study population mean PSQI (6.71).

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (factors associated with higher PSQI)
- Elevated depressive symptom burden stands out: the CES-D score is 22 (z ≈ 0.9) and has a relatively strong positive correlation with PSQI in the sample (r = 0.49). Within this dataset, depressive symptoms are one of the most robust correlates of worse subjective sleep quality and therefore represent a salient risk factor for above-average PSQI.  
- High night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration: median sleep duration is long but the standard deviation of sleep duration is very large (SD ≈ 193 minutes, z ≈ 2.09), and sleep start time SD is also elevated (≈157 minutes, z ≈ 1.63). Both variability measures correlate positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.17–0.19), indicating that irregular sleep timing and inconsistent duration are likely contributors to disturbed or less restorative sleep in this participant.  
- Physiological arousal / cardiovascular markers: resting heart rate is high (78.4 bpm, z ≈ 2.41) and MESOR (mean HR) is elevated (88.34, z ≈ 1.97). Elevated resting HR and higher mesor are modestly positively correlated with PSQI (r ≈ 0.05–0.11) and, together with a relatively blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -0.91), suggest higher baseline physiological activation and reduced circadian robustness—patterns that commonly accompany or exacerbate poor sleep.  
- Circadian fragmentation: intradaily variability is elevated (value 0.71, z ≈ 1.16). Higher IV indicates more fragmentation of activity/physiology across the day and has been linked to sleep complaints; in this dataset IV is non-negligibly above average and therefore consistent with higher PSQI risk.  
- Lifestyle / behavioral factors: prolonged sedentary/leisure time (sedentary hobby >4 hours, z ≈ 3.19; TV/video 2–3 hours, z ≈ 1.91) and minimal regular exercise (exercise 1–2 times/month or not at all) are present. These behavioral patterns are either weakly correlated with PSQI in the sample or are known contributors to sleep disturbance and thus add to the likelihood of higher PSQI for this participant.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep quality (factors associated with lower PSQI)
- Substantial median sleep duration: wearable-derived median sleep duration is long (about 8 hours 26 minutes, z ≈ 1.55). Longer total sleep opportunity is typically associated with lower PSQI (better subjective sleep) when it is efficient and consolidated, and here it provides a protective signal against sleep complaints.  
- Low frequency of naps: mean daily naps ≈ 0.0 (z ≈ -0.86). Little daytime napping reduces the likelihood that daytime sleep is fragmenting nocturnal sleep and is therefore a protective factor.  
- Low substance use: the participant reports no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use (z-scores for substance items are substantially below the sample mean). Absence of these substances is a behavioral factor that tends to support better sleep quality.  
- Some circadian regularity: interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are slightly above the sample mean (IS z ≈ 0.17, AC24 z ≈ 0.22), indicating that despite intradaily fragmentation there is a degree of day-to-day regularity in the timing of physiological rhythms, which can be protective for subjective sleep continuity.

Interpretation of circadian and hourly heart-rate patterns
- The hour-by-hour aggregate heart-rate deviation profile shows a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest deviations ~ -8 to -11 bpm between ~2–7 AM), indicating that the participant typically experiences an expected overnight reduction in heart rate. This nocturnal dip argues that physiological sleep periods include the expected parasympathetic-dominant lowering of heart rate. However, the combination of a relatively low cosinor amplitude (z ≈ -0.91) and elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.16) suggests that, although nights include the expected dip, the overall 24-hour rhythm is somewhat blunted and fragmented compared with peers. Elevated resting HR and MESOR imply higher baseline cardiac activation across the day, which can reflect lower cardiorespiratory fitness, chronic stress/arousal, or both—factors that tend to worsen subjective sleep. Taken together, the circadian heart-rate data indicate intact nocturnal dipping but reduced rhythm robustness and higher baseline physiological activation, a profile that tends to co-occur with higher PSQI scores.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI
- Balancing protective and risk signals, the dataset shows both substantial sleep opportunity (median duration well above the sample mean) and several robust risk indicators for poorer subjective sleep: notable depressive symptoms (CES-D 22), markedly irregular sleep timing and duration (high SDs), elevated resting heart rate/MESOR, and increased intradaily variability. Given the relatively large effect sizes for variability and physiological arousal (z-scores >1.5–2.4 for several measures) and the relatively strong sample correlation between depressive symptoms and PSQI (r ≈ 0.49), the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant is likely to have a PSQI that is above the study sample mean (i.e., worse sleep quality than the average participant, where the sample mean PSQI = 6.71).  
- In summary: the participant exhibits mixed signals—objectively long average sleep but marked irregularity, elevated baseline cardiac markers, and elevated depressive symptoms that are each associated with worse subjective sleep. Overall, these features combine to make it more likely that the participant’s PSQI would fall above the population mean rather than near or below it."
92552,"Summary of data sources and approach: The following interpretation integrates self-report trait and symptom measures, habitual behaviors, and wearable-derived sleep and heart-rate metrics collected across the semester. Correlations with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Z-scores referenced below are relative to the study sample and are used to weigh which features are most likely to relate to better versus worse global sleep quality.

Features that point toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several converging indicators suggest sleep disruption or circadian misalignment. The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (03:48), indicating a consistently delayed sleep schedule; late timing is often associated with poorer subjective sleep and daytime functioning. Night-to-night sleep variability is large (sleep duration SD = 174 minutes; Z = 1.66) and mean daily napping is elevated (0.22 naps/day; Z = 1.75); both variability and napping have positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset and generally reflect an irregular sleep pattern that can degrade sleep quality. Wearable circadian measures show relatively low interdaily stability (0.38, Z = -0.24) and elevated intradaily variability (0.59, Z = 0.32), consistent with an unstable daily rhythm. Physiological evidence further supports nocturnal arousal: aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations are unusually high across the overnight interval (notably 12–3 AM: deviations with Z-scores of ~2–4), implying elevated cardiovascular activity during expected sleep hours; these overnight deviations show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (e.g., up to ~0.22). Finally, trait symptom measures that are moderately associated with worse sleep (STAI trait anxiety score 45, Z = 0.37; CES-D = 15 with modest positive correlation to PSQI) indicate some anxiety and depressive symptom burden that—per their correlations—could contribute to poorer subjective sleep.

Features that point toward better sleep quality (lower PSQI): There are several aspects of the profile that would tend to protect or indicate reasonably preserved sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is near eight hours (7 h 49 min; Z = 0.79), which is generally adequate for restorative sleep and is inversely related to poor PSQI in many contexts. Resting heart rate and MESOR are relatively low (resting HR = 48.8 bpm, Z = -1.11; MESOR = 63, Z = -1.49), which may reflect better cardiovascular fitness and lower baseline physiological arousal. Self-report measures show modestly favorable psychosocial indicators (higher self-esteem Z = 0.82; lower perceived stress Z = -0.17; self-reported happiness Z = 0.55), all of which are plausibly protective for subjective sleep. Substance use is limited to moderate alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week) and no recreational or non-prescribed drug use; exercise occurs, albeit modestly, and the participant reports few sedentary leisure activities like TV/video gaming—patterns that are not strongly suggestive of poor sleep habits.

Circadian and physiological synthesis: Overall circadian metrics show an intact amplitude but evidence of irregular timing and fragmentation. The amplitude is near the sample mean (10.9, Z ≈ 0.04) and acrophase (peak heart-rate time) around 8:48 PM suggests the heart-rate rhythm is shifted or evening-weighted relative to a conventional daytime pattern. Low interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability indicate that the participant’s heart-rate rhythm lacks strong day-to-day regularity and shows within-day fragmentation. The pattern of elevated heart rate across late-night hours—paired with late sleep onset—suggests physiological activation overlapping with the habitual sleep window, a combination that tends to degrade subjective sleep quality even when total sleep time is adequate.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSQI: Taking the evidence together, the participant shows a mixed profile—adequate average sleep duration and low resting heart rate argue for preserved sleep physiology, but pronounced late sleep timing, high night-to-night variability, increased napping, circadian irregularity, and elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations are all features that typically raise PSQI scores. Additionally, trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (moderately correlated with PSQI in this sample) further increase the likelihood of poorer subjective sleep. On balance, these converging risk indicators suggest the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the study population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.72), i.e., somewhat worse than average in this sample. This conclusion emphasizes a relative increase in risk for elevated PSQI rather than a definitive categorical score; protective features (adequate duration, low resting HR, some positive psychosocial factors) moderate but do not fully offset the effects of timing irregularity and nocturnal physiological arousal.

Implications (brief): The dominant targets suggested by the multimodal data are sleep-timing regularity and nocturnal arousal—regularizing bedtime timing and reducing factors that sustain elevated physiology during the habitual sleep period would be the most direct behavioral targets to reduce PSQI-related symptoms, given the observed pattern."
73158,"Summary of indicators associated with poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several objective and behavioral features in the dataset point toward sources of sleep disturbance. Median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 11 minutes (Z = -1.25), which is shorter than the study population average and below commonly recommended durations; shorter sleep duration is a robust contributor to higher PSQI scores. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration was relatively elevated (SD = 105 minutes) and shows a modest positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.20), implying that irregular total sleep time could increase subjective sleep complaints. Sleep start time variability (SD ≈ 67 minutes) and some daytime evening heart-rate reductions (notable negative deviations across late evening hours) are also modestly associated with higher PSQI in the sample, suggesting that inconsistent bedtimes and residual evening physiological arousal may be relevant. Finally, the participant reports 1–2 hours of daily TV/video viewing (Z ≈ 1.28), which has a small positive correlation with PSQI in the sample and could reflect evening screen-time or passive evening habits that interfere with sleep onset for some individuals.

Summary of indicators associated with better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Multiple psychosocial and physiological markers point toward relatively favorable sleep-promoting conditions. Depressive symptoms are absent (CES-D = 0; Z = -1.38) and trait anxiety is low (STAI = 24; Z = -1.71); given the relatively strong positive correlations of depression and anxiety with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), these low scores are protective against poor subjective sleep. Self-esteem and current happiness are elevated (Self-Esteem Z ≈ +1.66; Happiness Z ≈ +1.64), and perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS Z ≈ -0.71), each of which tends to track with better sleep. The participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use, no daytime naps, and frequent group exercise (exercising with others three times/week or more), all lifestyle factors generally associated with improved sleep. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mesor are low (RHR ≈ 48 bpm, mesor ≈ 65.9; both Z ≈ -1.1), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness — a factor that in this sample shows either neutral or small favorable associations with PSQI.

Circadian and wearable-derived rhythm context: Heart-rate based circadian metrics indicate a relatively coherent daily rhythm with modest stability and low fragmentation: interdaily stability ≈ 0.39 (Z ≈ -0.16) and intradaily variability ≈ 0.44 (Z ≈ -0.74). Amplitude is near the sample mean and acrophase around early afternoon (≈ 1:01 PM), consistent with a typical diurnal pattern. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show clear nocturnal nadirs (large negative deviations from the mesor overnight) and pronounced morning rises (large positive deviations around 6–7 AM), which align with consolidated sleep at night and a well-timed morning activation. These circadian features and the pattern of nocturnal heart-rate suppression are generally consistent with consolidated nocturnal sleep and do not, on their own, indicate severe circadian misalignment.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the sample mean PSQI: Weighing the evidence together, the participant presents a mixed profile. Psychosocial and physiological indicators (very low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-reported well-being, absence of substance use, regular group exercise, low resting heart rate, and coherent circadian heart-rate patterns) are all factors that would predict relatively low PSQI (better subjective sleep). Counterbalancing these protections is objectively short median sleep duration (≈ 6 h 11 m) and measurable night-to-night variability in sleep duration and bedtimes, both of which are associated with higher PSQI in this sample. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely near or modestly better than the study population average — that is, at or slightly below the population mean PSQI of 6.73 (lower PSQI = better sleep). In other words, the participant’s profile suggests sleep quality “near the mean” with a modest leaning toward better-than-average sleep, but with clear opportunities for improvement in total sleep time and consistency of sleep timing."
45963,"Indicators consistent with relatively poor sleep quality are evident across self-report and wearable-derived measures. Trait anxiety (STAI = 62, Z = 2.05) and depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 22, Z = 0.90) are both elevated and have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (r ≈ 0.40 and r ≈ 0.49, respectively), which increases the likelihood of a higher PSQI score. The participant reports low positive affect and health satisfaction (Happiness current = 2.0, Z = -1.61; Health Satisfaction Z = -1.28) and relatively low self‑esteem (RSES = 30, Z = -1.15; sample r with PSQI ≈ -0.35), all of which in the sample are associated with poorer sleep. Wearable-derived circadian regularity is low: interdaily stability is markedly below the sample mean (0.16, Z = -2.06), and cosinor amplitude is attenuated (4.2, Z = -2.13), indicating a blunted and irregular heart‑rate rhythm across days—features that are typically linked with worse subjective sleep. Sleep timing is late and highly variable: median sleep start ~01:56 and sleep start SD = 215 minutes (Z = 2.89), pointing to inconsistent and late bedtimes, which commonly degrade sleep quality. Resting heart rate is elevated (68.2 bpm, Z = 1.2) and several late-night hourly heart‑rate deviations (12–2 a.m.) are above the mesor while the deepest negative deviations occur later in the night (2–7 a.m.), a pattern that can reflect delayed or fragmented sleep onset and heightened pre‑sleep arousal. Taken together, these factors converge on multiple pathways known to raise PSQI scores.

There are also objective and behavioral signals that are relatively supportive of sleep consolidation or that temper the extent of impairment. Median nightly sleep duration (6 h 40 min, Z = -0.64) is only modestly below the sample mean and is not severely short by the cohort distribution; mean daily naps are rare (0.08/day), which reduces the likelihood of daytime sleep replacing nocturnal sleep. Intradaily variability is somewhat lower than the sample mean (0.39, Z = -1.09), which can reflect fewer rapid transitions between activity and rest within days and may be consistent with consolidated rest periods when they occur. The participant reports no recreational drug use and only moderate alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2×/week, Z = 0.94), limiting some behavioral contributors to poor sleep. Daytime heart‑rate deviations show pronounced positive departures during mid‑day (e.g., 12–1 p.m. to 11–12 p.m.), consistent with consolidated daytime activity and alertness rather than pervasive daytime somnolence.

Physiological circadian summary supports a picture of preserved day–night separation but reduced amplitude and stability. The mesor (81.8 bpm, Z = 1.07) and positive daytime deviations indicate a clear daytime elevation in cardiovascular activity, while the negative deviations across the core sleep window (2–7 a.m.) are consistent with nocturnal physiological lowering of heart rate. However, the low cosinor amplitude (Z = -2.13) and low interdaily stability (Z = -2.06) indicate that the strength and regularity of that day–night contrast are attenuated across days, and the very large variability in sleep start time (Z = 2.89) suggests the timing of that nocturnal lowering is inconsistent. These physiological patterns are therefore compatible with periods of adequate consolidated sleep but occurring at irregular, late times and with blunted circadian amplitude—conditions that are associated with worse subjective sleep.

Holistically, the balance of evidence points toward sleep quality that is worse than the study population average. Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, marked irregularity in sleep timing, attenuated circadian amplitude and stability, and elevated resting heart rate are all established correlates of higher PSQI and are present in this profile. Although total sleep time is not extremely short and daytime napping is rare, those more favorable signals do not fully offset the multiple risk factors for poor sleep. Compared to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the combined pattern of psychosocial and physiological indicators suggests the participant’s sleep quality is likely above the population mean (i.e., poorer than average) rather than near or below it. This inference relies on both the direct metric correlations reported in the study and the coherent convergence across modalities, but it should be interpreted as probabilistic rather than definitive in the absence of the participant’s actual PSQI score."
22138,"Objective wearable data indicate several features consistent with relatively well-consolidated, restorative nocturnal physiology. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 32 minutes (Z = 0.43), indicating sleep quantity at or slightly above the study mean. Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a reasonably structured rhythm: interdaily stability = 0.47 (Z = 0.50) and a relatively low intradaily variability = 0.47 (Z = -0.53), along with a moderately high amplitude (13.05, Z = 0.73). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show clear nocturnal heart-rate troughs (largest negative deviations between ~1–5 AM, with a nadir around 3–4 AM at –21.12 bpm), and robust daytime rises (peaking mid-to-late afternoon/early evening). Resting heart rate was typical (60.6 bpm, Z = 0.29). Taken together, these objective patterns — consistent sleep duration, marked nightly cardiac slowing, low fragmentation of daily rhythm, and high amplitude — are generally associated with better sleep quality and physiological recovery.

In contrast, there are objective and behavioral signals that plausibly increase risk for poorer subjective sleep. The participant’s typical sleep start time was late (median start ≈ 01:15 AM) and the variability in sleep onset was relatively high (sleep-start SD = 121 minutes, Z = 0.83), both of which are commonly associated with worse perceived sleep quality and circadian misalignment. Although total time asleep was adequate, the late timing and night-to-night variability of sleep onset are features that often elevate PSQI scores and daytime impairment for some people.

Self-report psychological measures add mixed information but include notable risk signals. Trait anxiety (STAI-Trait = 50, Z = 0.86) and perceived stress (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) are elevated relative to the sample and each correlates positively with PSQI in this dataset (STAI correlation ≈ 0.40, CES-D correlation ≈ 0.49, PSS correlation ≈ 0.20), suggesting that the participant’s internal stress/anxiety states could contribute to poorer subjective sleep. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18) are modestly increased but below common clinical cutoffs; self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.54), which is a protective factor (RSES correlation with PSQI ≈ -0.35). Alcohol use (wine/liquor ~1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94) and evening screen/time-inactivity habits (e.g., watching TV 1–2 hours, Z = 1.28) are present and could modestly affect sleep quality for some individuals, although their correlations with PSQI in this sample are small.

Balancing the evidence: objective wearable signals (adequate sleep duration, strong nighttime cardiac decline, structured circadian metrics, no daytime naps) generally point to relatively good sleep physiology and lower risk for high PSQI. On the other hand, late and somewhat variable bedtimes, elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, and modest evening behaviors are plausible contributors to a higher subjective PSQI. Given the relative magnitudes (objective circadian stability/amplitude and adequate sleep duration are reasonably strong and consistent, whereas the psychological risk signals are moderate), the overall pattern suggests this participant’s sleep quality is likely at least as good as the average study participant, and plausibly somewhat better.

Compared to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the integrated evidence is most consistent with a PSQI score below the population mean (i.e., relatively better sleep quality than average). This inference carries uncertainty—particularly because elevated anxiety/stress and late, variable sleep timing are credible risk factors for worse subjective sleep—and would be strengthened by the participant’s actual PSQI score or additional measures of sleep continuity/efficiency and daytime functioning."
31439,"Summary and context: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of psychological, behavioral and physiological signals that bear on sleep quality. Key self-report values include a CES-D of 16 (Z ≈ 0.28) and STAI–Trait of 49 (Z ≈ 0.76), both of which have the strongest positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (r = 0.49 and r = 0.40, respectively). Wearable-derived cardiac measures are notable: a high mesor (91.4 bpm, Z = 2.38) and elevated resting heart rate (78.2 bpm, Z = 2.38). Objective sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 h 41 min (Z = −0.61) and a median sleep start time near 00:40 with a modest night-to-night variability (start-time SD ≈ 67 min). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate modest interdaily stability (0.44, Z = 0.25) and low intradaily variability (0.37, Z = −1.24) with a relatively small amplitude (9.24, Z = −0.50); hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal decline and daytime elevations consistent with preserved day–night separation of activity.

Features indicating higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): The participant’s depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are the most salient psychological risk factors for poorer sleep—both scores are above the study mean and have the largest positive correlations with PSQI (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40). Physiologically, the participant’s elevated mesor and resting heart rate (both Z ≈ 2.38) are unusual relative to the sample and are associated with slightly higher PSQI in the study (mesor r ≈ 0.07; RHR r ≈ 0.13); elevated tonic cardiac activation can reflect hyperarousal that is commonly linked to worse subjective sleep. Sleep quantity is somewhat reduced compared with the sample (median 6 h 41 min, Z = −0.61), and night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 110 min; correlation with PSQI r = 0.20) suggests inconsistent sleep opportunity that tends to co-occur with worse self-reported sleep. Behavioral habits associated with poorer sleep—moderate weekly alcohol use and above-average evening screen time (watching TV/videos ~1–2 hours, Z ≈ 1.28)—also weakly favor higher PSQI scores in this sample.

Features indicating lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Several objective wearable-derived rhythm features point toward reasonably structured sleep–wake physiology. Intradaily variability is low (0.37, Z = −1.24), indicating limited within-day fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm, and interdaily stability is modestly positive (0.44, Z = 0.25), suggesting a generally consistent 24‑hour pattern. The participant reports almost no napping (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07), which reduces the chance of daytime sleep eroding nocturnal sleep drive. Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg ≈ 39, Z ≈ 0.11; correlation with PSQI r = −0.35), and exercise — while not frequent — is present (1–2 times/week), both of which are small protective factors in the sample. Hourly heart-rate profiles show a clear nocturnal nadir of heart rate (large negative deviations 2–5 AM) and daytime elevations, consistent with preserved night-time physiological rest.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study mean: Weighing these indicators, the strongest contributors in this profile are the elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both moderately correlated with PSQI), together with objectively elevated mesor/resting heart rate and slightly short average sleep duration. Protective signals (low intradaily variability, modest interdaily stability, little napping, and high self‑esteem) mitigate but do not fully counterbalance the risk signals. On balance, the evidence is most consistent with sleep quality that is modestly worse than the study population average. Relative to the sample PSQI mean of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s pattern of psychological distress and physiological hyperarousal suggests a PSQI likely above the population mean (i.e., worse-than-average sleep), but not necessarily an extreme outlier beyond about one standard deviation.

Key points for follow-up or intervention targets: The data point to three high-yield areas to consider monitoring or addressing if the goal is improved sleep quality: (1) mood and anxiety symptoms (given their relatively strong association with PSQI), (2) nocturnal physiological hyperarousal (elevated resting heart rate and mesor), and (3) sleep opportunity/consistency (sleep duration below 7 hours and moderate variability). Interventions or further assessment that target these domains (behavioral sleep consistency, alcohol/evening screen use, and strategies to reduce arousal and treat mood/anxiety symptoms) would be most consistent with the multimodal signals observed."
46558,"Summary and context: The participant’s multimodal profile is mixed with respect to factors commonly linked to PSQI-measured sleep quality. Objectively, wearable-derived sleep duration is near normative: median nightly sleep was 7 hours 5 minutes (Z = -0.12), with low night-to-night variability (SD = 58 minutes, Z = -0.98) and infrequent napping. Circadian regularity metrics are modestly favorable (interdaily stability = 0.51, Z = 0.83; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.41, Z = 0.73), and wearable heart-rate data show a clear nocturnal decline (hourly deviations from mesor reach approximately -15 to -17 bpm between ~2:00–6:00 AM), consistent with physiologic sleep consolidation. Subjective well-being indicators also include relatively high momentary happiness (current = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and above-average health satisfaction (5.33, Z = 0.8). Taken together, these objective and self-report features provide multiple protective signals for preserved sleep continuity and physiological sleep depth.

Factors that suggest relatively poorer sleep (higher PSQI): Several behavioral and symptom measures point toward risks for worse sleep. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (01:14:30 AM), and evening/late-night sedentary leisure is high (video game use 2–3 hours, Z = 3.23), both of which are commonly associated with delayed sleep timing and reduced sleep quality. Self-report depressive symptoms are elevated (CES-D = 17; Z ≈ 0.38 and classified as “Depressed” in the survey context), and depressive symptoms in this dataset show a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.50), indicating that mood-related distress is a meaningful predictor of higher (worse) PSQI. Trait anxiety has a modest positive association with PSQI as well (STAI = 37, correlation ≈ 0.40). Low physical activity/exercise frequency (reported exercise “less than 1–2 times a month,” Z ≈ -1.18) is another behavioral risk factor, because lower activity tends to relate to poorer sleep in the sample.

Factors that suggest relatively better sleep (lower PSQI): Several objective and behavioral indicators point toward more favorable sleep. Median total sleep time meets common healthy-recommendation thresholds and is near the study population mean; night-to-night stability of both duration and sleep start time is relatively good (low SDs), which typically associates with lower PSQI. Circadian rhythm metrics show moderately high interdaily stability and a measurable 24-hour autocorrelation, suggesting consistent daily structure—features that in this sample relate weakly but directionally to lower PSQI. Physiologically, the pronounced overnight heart-rate reduction and a resting heart rate in the low 60s (60.7 bpm) are consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest. Substance use is minimal (no regular liquor or recreational drug use; beer 1–2×/month), and the participant reports no naps, both of which are supportive of nighttime sleep health. Higher self-esteem and higher momentary happiness—each negatively correlated with PSQI in the sample—may also provide some protective influence.

Circadian and physiological pattern interpretation: Heart-rate cosinor parameters show a mesor around 73 bpm and an acrophase at ~5:17 PM, with a modest amplitude (10.3), consistent with a daytime-centered activity peak and a clear nocturnal trough. The large negative hourly deviations across typical sleep hours (roughly -12 to -17 bpm between 1:00–7:00 AM) indicate a robust nightly autonomic downshift. Interdaily stability (0.51, Z = 0.83) indicates that the participant maintains reasonably consistent daily rhythms over the recording period; intradaily variability is not markedly elevated (0.59, Z = 0.32). The combination of a late clock time for sleep onset but otherwise stable daily rhythms suggests a stable evening-shifted schedule rather than chaotic scheduling.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to sample mean PSQI: Balancing risks and protections, the profile is mixed: behavioral and symptom-level signals (notably elevated depressive symptoms, late habitual sleep onset, low exercise, and substantial evening video game use) point toward increased likelihood of poorer subjective sleep, while objective wearable metrics (adequate median sleep duration, low variability, no naps, regular circadian metrics, and a clear nocturnal heart-rate decline) argue for generally consolidated physiological sleep. Given this balance—moderate risk from mood and timing but multiple objective protections—the participant’s overall sleep quality, as inferred from the combined data, would most plausibly be near the study sample mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73). In other words, this profile does not strongly indicate substantially better or worse sleep than the average participant, though the elevated depressive symptoms and late sleep timing suggest vulnerability to a higher PSQI if mood or evening behaviors worsen."
93699,"Summary — inferred overall sleep quality:
Taking the full set of self-report and wearable-derived metrics together, the pattern is mixed but does not strongly indicate either extreme of sleep disturbance. Several objective circadian and physiological indicators are consistent with a preserved day–night rhythm and typical nocturnal heart rate troughs, while behavioral and trait measures point to some sleep-relevant vulnerabilities (late, somewhat variable bedtimes and elevated trait anxiety). On balance I estimate the participant’s overall sleep quality to be near the study sample’s mean PSQI (population mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), with a modest probability that their individual PSQI would be slightly higher than the sample mean rather than markedly lower.

Evidence pointing toward higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality)
- Bedtime timing and variability: The median sleep start time is late (about 00:59), and sleep start time standard deviation is relatively large (89 minutes). Greater bedtime lateness and night-to-night variability are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. The sleep-duration standard deviation is also elevated (108 minutes), and greater variability in sleep timing/duration correlates positively with PSQI in this dataset (sleep variability correlation ≈ 0.18–0.20).
- Trait anxiety and lower self-esteem: The participant’s STAI–Trait score (44, Z ≈ 0.27) indicates elevated anxiety proneness; STAI shows a positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.40), so anxiety-related arousal is a plausible contributor to worse subjective sleep. Rosenberg self-esteem is modestly below average (score 35, Z ≈ −0.45); lower self-esteem in this dataset is associated with higher PSQI (r ≈ −0.35 for self-esteem), so this is another psychosocial factor that may worsen sleep.
- Slightly short typical sleep duration: Median nightly sleep is 6 h 51 min (Z ≈ −0.42), which is below a commonly recommended 7+ hours and could contribute to reports of nonrestorative sleep or daytime sleepiness in some individuals.
- Behavioral evening exposures and sedentary habits: High reported internet use (>4 hours/day, Z ≈ 2.19) and above-average television time (1–2 hours, Z ≈ 1.28) are behaviors that tend to co-occur with poorer sleep in population studies (small positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset). Low frequency of solitary exercise and limited engagement in active sports also reduce a potential protective factor for sleep quality.

Evidence pointing toward lower PSQI (better sleep quality)
- Low depressive symptoms and perceived stress: The CES-D score is low (8, Z ≈ −0.55) and the Perceived Stress Scale score is very low relative to the sample (PSS Z ≈ −2.34). Both depression and perceived stress are positively correlated with PSQI in this study (CES-D r ≈ 0.50, PSS r ≈ 0.21); therefore these low scores argue in favor of better subjective sleep than would be expected if depressive symptoms or stress were elevated.
- Preserved circadian structure and regularity in wearable rhythm metrics: Interdaily stability (0.51, Z ≈ 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.42, Z ≈ 0.81) are relatively high, indicating stable day-to-day rhythming of heart rate. Intradaily variability is modest (0.53, Z ≈ −0.11), and cosinor-derived amplitude and acrophase (peak around 4:00 PM) are indicative of a detectable and structured circadian pattern. In general, greater rhythm stability and clearer circadian amplitude are associated with better sleep consolidation and lower PSQI (though correlations are small in this sample).
- Clear nocturnal heart rate nadir: Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show a substantive nocturnal trough (large negative deviations from the mesor between about midnight and 7 AM), consistent with physiologic sleep-related reduction in cardiovascular arousal. This pattern supports adequate physiological separation between wake and sleep periods.
- Limited napping: Mean daily naps = 0 (Z ≈ −0.86), which reduces the probability of daytime sleep fragmentation or compensatory daytime sleep that can degrade nocturnal sleep consolidation.

Physiological arousal and autonomic indicators
Resting heart rate and mesor are somewhat elevated relative to the sample (resting HR ≈ 64.8 bpm, mesor ≈ 79.4 bpm; both Z ≈ +0.7–0.8). Elevated resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSQI here (r ≈ 0.12), which could reflect modest tonic autonomic arousal that contributes to sleep complaints in some people. However, the preserved amplitude of circadian heart-rate variation and a pronounced nocturnal nadir argue against pervasive nocturnal hyperarousal; instead the data suggest a physiological profile with typical day–night segregation but a slightly higher baseline cardiovascular tone.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to population PSQI
Weighing the factors above, the participant presents a mix of protective and risk features. Low depressive symptoms and low perceived stress, stable circadian rhythm metrics, and a clear nocturnal heart-rate trough favor normative or relatively good subjective sleep. Counterbalancing these are late and somewhat variable bedtimes, modestly short median sleep duration, elevated trait anxiety, elevated resting heart rate, and high evening/weekday screen exposure — all of which tend to increase the likelihood of higher PSQI scores. Given the magnitude and direction of these signals, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s sleep quality is close to the study sample average (i.e., “near the mean” of PSQI = 6.72). There is a plausible tendency for their individual PSQI to be slightly above the population mean rather than substantially below it, but the evidence does not strongly support classifying them at an extreme (e.g., very poor sleep) based on the available multimodal data.

Practical implications to consider (research-focused)
- Targets most likely to shift subjective sleep quality upward would be interventions addressing bedtime regularity and evening screen time, and strategies to reduce trait-like cognitive arousal at night (given the STAI association). 
- Monitoring of resting heart rate and sleep-timing variability over subsequent weeks could help detect early changes in sleep quality not captured by a single median value."
84011,"Objective wearable-derived sleep measures indicate substantial sleep opportunity and generally robust nocturnal physiological quiescence. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration of 8 hours 28 minutes (Z = +1.59) is well above the study sample median and is a strong protective indicator against poor PSQI scores; naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86), supporting consolidated nocturnal sleep opportunity. Resting heart rate is low (51.4 bpm, Z = -0.80) and the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions relative to the mesor (e.g., -15 to -17 bpm across much of 1–7 AM), consistent with physiologic nighttime downregulation. These objective features (long duration, low resting HR, clear nighttime heart-rate nadir) would, on their own, be associated with lower PSQI scores (better sleep).

In contrast, several circadian and temporal-structure metrics point toward irregularity that can undermine sleep quality. Interdaily stability is below the sample mean (value 0.35, Z = -0.49) while intradaily variability is elevated (value 0.69, Z = +1.02), a pattern indicative of day-to-day schedule variability and more fragmented transitions between activity and rest. The participant’s median sleep-start time is shortly after midnight (00:03) with a nontrivial night-to-night start-time SD (82 minutes), meaning sleep timing is somewhat delayed and variably timed. Together, these features are commonly associated with increased sleep complaints and can contribute to higher PSQI scores even when total sleep time is adequate.

Self-report psychosocial variables provide a mixed contribution. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and perceived stress is modest (PSS = 20, Z = -0.44), both of which argue against marked subjective sleep disturbance. However, trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 44, Z = +0.27) and is relatively more strongly correlated with PSQI in the sample (reported score correlation ~0.40), suggesting anxiety-related arousal may increase vulnerability to sleep problems (e.g., difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep) despite otherwise favorable objective sleep quantity. Health behaviors are protective overall: frequent team or group exercise and sports participation (Zs for exercising with others and sports +1.23 and +1.58), low substance use, and good health satisfaction are factors that tend to lower risk for poor sleep.

Additional wearable signals give a nuanced picture of evening physiology and daytime peaks. There are large positive deviations from mesor in late afternoon and evening hours (notably 8–9 PM: +22.05, Z = +2.19; 5–6 PM: +18.23, Z = +1.12), which may reflect relatively high evening physiological activation (exercise, social activity, or arousal). Some abrupt declines across the 9–11 PM window (9–10 PM deviation negative) suggest a marked transition toward lower heart rate around typical sleep onset, consistent with the late-night sleep start. While these hour-by-hour deviations are not strongly correlated with PSQI in the dataset, they are consistent with a profile of adequate sleep duration obtained at later and somewhat variable clock times.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study sample: weighing objective and self-report evidence, the participant’s profile contains strong protective signals for sleep quality (notably long median sleep duration, low naps, low resting HR, active lifestyle) together with moderate risk signals (reduced interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, variable sleep start time, and modest trait anxiety). Overall, this mixed pattern most plausibly indicates sleep quality that is at least as good as, and likely somewhat better than, the study sample average. In other words, inferred PSQI level is below the population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD 2.16) — i.e., the participant’s overall sleep quality appears somewhat better than the sample mean — although circadian irregularity and anxiety create vulnerability for intermittent or subjective sleep complaints despite objectively long sleep duration."
88008,"Summary conclusion: Integrating the wearable-derived physiology, sleep timing and duration, and self-report measures yields a mixed profile in which objective circadian regularity and healthy habits coexist with short, late-timed sleep and elevated mood/anxiety symptoms. On balance, the pattern of shorter median sleep duration (6 h 9 min) and late sleep onset (median start ~01:14) together with elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms makes it more likely that this participant’s PSQI score is above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73). This judgment weighs the moderate-to-strong positive associations between depressive/anxiety symptom scores and PSQI in the sample, and the known impact of short, delayed sleep on subjective sleep quality; it is not a direct PSQI score but an inference based on the available multimodal indicators.

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is substantially below the sample average (6 h 9 m; Z = -1.29), and sleep onset is late (median start 01:13:59), both of which are commonly associated with higher PSQI component scores for duration and sleep latency. Self-report affective measures that are positively correlated with PSQI are elevated: CES-D = 20 (Z = 0.70) and STAI–Trait = 48 (Z = 0.66); in the study these scales show moderate correlations with PSQI (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40), implying that depressive and anxiety symptom burden may be contributing to poorer subjective sleep quality. Evening-hour aggregate heart-rate deviations show relatively large positive deviations in the early evening (peaks around 7–9 pm), which could reflect greater evening physiological activation and may be temporally associated with later sleep onset. Although naps are rare, variability in sleep duration (SD ~68 minutes) and a sleep start-time SD (~77 minutes) indicate night-to-night inconsistency that correlates modestly with higher PSQI in this sample.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Several wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate strong and stable circadian organization that tends to relate to better sleep consolidation and subjective quality. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.52; Z = 0.91), intradaily variability is low (0.30; Z = -1.73), autocorrelation at 24 h is elevated (Z = 0.73), and amplitude from the cosinor analysis is high (amplitude 15.36; Z = 1.48). Together these features suggest a robust, well-entrained daily rhythm in heart rate across days, and the nighttime heart-rate nadir is pronounced (large negative deviations between ~2–6 am), consistent with consolidated physiological rest. Behavioral and lifestyle markers that favor sleep quality are also present: minimal alcohol or recreational drug use, frequent exercise (exercising alone and sports three times a week or more; exercise Z-scores positive), low nap frequency (mean daily naps 0.08), and a relatively low resting heart rate (55.1 bpm; Z = -0.36), which together point to generally health-promoting behaviors and fitness that often support sleep quality.

Synthesis and interpretation: The most salient conflict in the profile is between marked circadian robustness/healthy lifestyle versus insufficient and late-timed sleep combined with elevated affective symptoms. The strong, stable circadian signals and low intradaily fragmentation argue that physiological sleep–wake regulation is intact and may buffer the individual against severe sleep fragmentation; however, the short median duration and late sleep timing—together with depressive and anxiety symptom load, and modest evening physiological activation—are risk factors for increased subjective sleep complaints and higher PSQI. Given the relative magnitudes (sleep duration Z = -1.29; CES-D and STAI both ~Z = +0.7; interdaily stability and amplitude Z > +0.9), the net balance points toward sleep quality that is likely worse than the study population mean (i.e., above the mean PSQI). This conclusion should be understood as a probabilistic inference from multimodal indicators rather than a direct PSQI score; the participant’s robust circadian markers and healthy behaviors suggest that targeted changes (for example, earlier bedtimes, addressing evening activation or mood symptoms) could have meaningful benefit for subjective sleep quality."
83566,"Summary of multimodal findings: The participant’s data show a complex pattern in which subjective symptom burden and some physiological markers point toward poorer sleep quality, while several behavioral and circadian features indicate relative preservation of sleep duration and daily regularity. Self-report measures are notable for high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 37, Z = 2.47) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 62, Z = 2.05); both of these measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40), suggesting a substantial association between affective symptoms and worse sleep. Wearable-derived physiology also shows elevated baseline cardiovascular tone (Mesor = 84.8 bpm, Z = 1.49; Resting HR = 69.4 bpm, Z = 1.34), which can reflect higher physiological arousal and is weakly positively correlated with PSQI (r ≈ 0.1–0.12).

Factors consistent with relatively poorer sleep (likely higher PSQI): The combination of marked depressive and anxiety symptoms is the strongest signal that would predict higher PSQI in this participant, given the relatively large Z-scores and the moderate correlations of these scales with PSQI. The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:52 AM), which can be associated with circadian misalignment and subjective sleep problems even when total duration is prolonged. Resting heart rate and elevated mesor (both Z > 1) suggest a higher tonic physiological arousal level that is often linked with poorer subjective sleep. Low engagement in physical activity (exercise alone 1–2×/month; little sports or group exercise) and low self-reported happiness and self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.29, Happiness Z = -1.61) are additional behavioral/psychosocial features that, in this dataset, tend to co-occur with worse PSQI (stress and low positive affect have small-to-moderate correlations with PSQI in the sample).

Factors consistent with relatively better sleep (likely lower PSQI): Objective sleep duration is substantial (median = 8 h 8 min, Z = 1.18) and nightly nap frequency is essentially zero (Z = -0.86), both of which are classically protective or at least not indicative of short-sleep related impairment. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is lower than the sample mean (SD = 65 minutes, Z = -0.82), and sleep start time variability is not elevated (SD ≈ 66 minutes, Z = -0.37), so the participant’s sleep duration and timing are relatively consistent despite being late. Circadian regularity metrics are modestly favorable: interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.42, Z = 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (0.43, Z = 0.90), indicating day-to-day regularity in heart-rate rhythms — a feature generally associated with better sleep consolidation. Low substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use) is another behavioral factor that would tend to support better sleep quality.

Integrative conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing these signals, the strongest and most predictive indicators in this dataset favor worse subjective sleep: markedly elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores (both Z > 2 and with moderate correlations to PSQI) and elevated tonic cardiovascular measures. These factors outweigh the protective signals from long and relatively stable sleep duration and circadian regularity. Therefore, the overall profile is most compatible with a PSQI score above the study population mean (population mean = 6.72). Given the magnitude of affective symptoms and their known associations with sleep disturbance in this sample, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is likely meaningfully worse than the average participant rather than merely near the mean.

Interpretive caveats: This inference integrates cross-sectional symptom measures and aggregated wearable metrics; it does not substitute for a direct PSQI score or clinical assessment. Long sleep duration can reflect either healthy rest or compensatory time-in-bed in response to poor sleep quality (e.g., nonrestorative sleep), and elevated resting heart rate and affective symptoms could be both causes and consequences of disturbed sleep. If actionable next steps are desired, focusing on affective symptom management, modest increases in daytime physical activity, and earlier sleep timing could be targeted as plausible avenues to improve subjective sleep quality."
87032,"Summary of key indicators: The participant shows a late and irregular sleep schedule (median sleep start ~02:00 AM; sleep-start standard deviation 145 minutes, Z = 1.36) with a median nightly duration that is slightly below the sample mean (6 h 43 min; Z = -0.58). Self-report measures indicate elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 28, Z = 1.53) and above-average perceived stress (PSS = 26, Z = 1.19); trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27). Wearable-derived circadian metrics point to reduced day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.27, Z = -1.15; 24‑hour autocorrelation = 0.10, Z = -1.87) and relatively high within‑day fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.75, Z = 1.44). Resting heart rate and mesor are higher than the study population mean (resting HR = 69.4 bpm, Z = 1.34; mesor = 85.35, Z = 1.56), and recreational screen/internet use is substantially above the sample average (internet >4 hours, Z = 2.19; listening to music >4 hours, Z = 2.06).

Evidence indicating factors likely to increase PSQI (worse sleep): Multiple converging signals associated in this sample with poorer PSQI scores are present. The participant’s depressive symptom burden is relatively high (CES‑D Z = 1.53) and CES‑D correlates strongly with PSQI in the study (r ≈ 0.49), making mood a leading risk factor for worse subjective sleep. The sleep schedule is both late and inconsistent (median start ~02:00 AM; high start-time SD), and objective circadian metrics show low interdaily stability and low 24‑hour autocorrelation—patterns that, in the literature and in these sample correlations, are linked to poorer subjective sleep. Elevated intradaily variability suggests more fragmented daily physiology, which is consistent with disturbed sleep continuity. Elevated resting heart rate and mesor (Z > 1.3) point to higher baseline physiological arousal, which can accompany or exacerbate sleep complaints. Behavioural factors that tend to associate with poorer sleep—high evening/nighttime screen and sedentary recreational use and little regular exercise (exercise frequency Zs around -1.6 to -1.9)—are also present.

Evidence indicating factors likely to lower PSQI (better sleep): There are some mitigating features. Total nightly sleep time is near seven hours (6 h 43 min), which, while slightly below optimal, is not extremely short and is only modestly different from the study mean (Z = -0.58). Substance use is very low (alcohol and recreational drugs: “not at all” or infrequent; negative Z‑scores), which reduces a common source of sleep disruption. The wearable amplitude and acrophase (peak around mid‑late afternoon) show an overall day–night heart rate rhythm with a nocturnal trough (hourly deviations show negative values overnight), indicating preserved basic diurnal physiology even if timing is irregular. Social functioning and academic performance (GPA ~3.4–3.5) do not point to severe functional impairment that would necessarily co‑occur with very high PSQI scores.

Circadian and heart-rate profile interpretation: The participant’s cosinor-derived mesor and acrophase indicate a relatively elevated overall heart-rate level with a mid‑afternoon peak, but the non‑parametric measures show weak day‑to‑day regularity and higher within‑day fragmentation. Overnight hourly deviations include pronounced negative values at several early‑morning hours (consistent with nocturnal heart‑rate decline) but some atypical morning/hourly patterns (e.g., a small negative deviation at 6–7 AM with a high Z for that hour), consistent with variable wake and sleep times. Together, the circadian summary suggests that the temporal structure of physiology is preserved in amplitude but poorly consolidated across days—an objective pattern that typically aligns with complaints of variable or lower-quality sleep.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the profile contains multiple, moderately sized risk signals for poorer subjective sleep—most notably elevated depressive symptoms (strongly correlated with PSQI in this sample), variable and late sleep timing, weak interdaily stability and autocorrelation, high intradaily variability, and elevated resting HR. Protective factors (low substance use, near‑seven‑hour median sleep) are present but less compelling given the strength of the mood and circadian irregularity signals. On balance, the available multimodal data indicate that the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the study sample mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average). This inference is probabilistic and guided by the pattern of correlated measures in the sample rather than by a direct PSQI score; uncertainty remains because several indicators (total sleep time and preserved nocturnal HR troughs) temper the conclusion."
94641,"Summary and approach: The following synthesis integrates self-report trait and symptom measures, wearable-derived sleep timing and variability, and heart rate–based circadian metrics to evaluate contributors to nocturnal sleep quality as indexed by the PSQI. I weigh features by both their effect sizes (Z-scores) and the reported correlations with PSQI in the sample, and I distinguish subjective symptom burden from objective behavioral/physiological markers. Below I first summarize evidence that would tend to increase (worse) PSQI, then evidence that would tend to decrease (better) PSQI, and finish with a balanced overall judgment relative to the study population mean (population PSQI mean = 6.71, SD = 2.16).

Features consistent with higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality)
- High depressive and anxiety symptom burden are the most salient risk signals. The participant’s CES-D score is 29 (Z = 1.63) and STAI–Trait is 54 (Z = 1.25); both have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.49 and 0.40). These elevations in mood/anxiety symptoms are therefore strong indicators of worse subjective sleep quality.  
- Nocturnal sleep quantity and regularity: median nightly sleep is relatively short (6 h 15 min; Z = -1.15), and night-to-night sleep duration is highly variable (SD = 168 min; Z = 1.52). The combination of shorter median sleep and high variability in duration aligns with poorer sleep outcomes; sleep variability here is positively correlated with PSQI (r ≈ 0.19). Sleep start times are relatively late (median ≈ 00:30) with moderate variability (start-time SD ≈ 89 min; r ≈ 0.18), which also tends to associate with higher PSQI.  
- Nap behavior: mean daily naps ~0.3 (Z = 2.66) indicates a higher-than-typical propensity to nap, and napping shows a positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.15) in the sample—suggesting daytime sleep may be compensatory for disrupted nocturnal sleep.  
- Physiological arousal indicators: resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (70.3 bpm; Z = 1.44) and has a small positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.12). Elevated resting cardiovascular tone often accompanies hyperarousal or stress and can relate to worse sleep.  
- Lifestyle/behavioral correlates: very low reported exercise and high sedentary hobby time (large positive Z for sedentary hobby) plus substantial evening-oriented activities (e.g., video gaming, extended music listening) map onto behavioral patterns that can impede sleep consolidation or delay sleep onset; stress score is modestly elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38) and correlates positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.20).

Features consistent with lower PSQI (better sleep quality)
- Preserved circadian structure in heart-rate rhythms. Interdaily stability is near the sample mean (value = 0.42; Z ≈ 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (Z = 1.15), which indicate a reasonably consistent day-to-day timing of physiological rhythms—factors that generally support sleep consolidation and are associated with better PSQI (autocorrelation correlation is slightly negative with PSQI in the sample).  
- Normal nocturnal heart rate profile and timing: the aggregated hourly deviations show marked nocturnal dips (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:49 PM), consistent with a preserved day–night rhythm in cardiovascular activity. This pattern suggests intact nocturnal physiological downregulation, which is usually favorable for sleep.  
- Low substance use: the participant reports no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use; absence of nocturnal alcohol/drug effects removes a common contributor to disturbed sleep, which would tend to reduce PSQI risk.  
- Functional indicators: academic performance is high (GPAs in the high range), and self-reported current happiness is slightly above sample mean (Z ≈ 0.55), both of which can moderate the overall impact of stressors on sleep for some individuals.

Integrated interpretation and relative judgment
Balancing these sources, the strongest and most predictive signals point toward poorer sleep quality for this participant. Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (high CES-D and STAI) are the highest-risk factors because of both their absolute elevations (Z > 1) and relatively large sample correlations with PSQI. These psychological symptom burdens are reinforced by short median sleep, large night-to-night variability in sleep duration, frequent naps, elevated resting heart rate, and behavioral patterns (low exercise, high sedentary and evening screen/hobby time) that are consistent with fragmented or insufficient nocturnal sleep. In contrast, objective circadian structure in heart-rate measures (reasonable interdaily stability and high 24 h autocorrelation) and normal nocturnal HR dipping provide partial protective evidence, and the absence of alcohol/drug use is another mitigating factor.

Overall conclusion relative to the study population
Taking all evidence together, the participant’s sleep quality is most likely worse than average in this sample—i.e., their inferred PSQI is above the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.71). This conclusion is driven primarily by elevated mood/anxiety symptoms and by objective/behavioral markers of short and highly variable nocturnal sleep. Degree of confidence: moderate. The circadian regularity and lack of substance use lower the probability that sleep is severely disordered, but the symptom burden and sleep variability point to a meaningful elevation in PSQI relative to peers. Consideration of interventions that target mood/anxiety, stabilize sleep timing, reduce nocturnal variability, and increase daytime activity/exercise could be expected to have the largest potential impact on improving sleep quality for this participant."
82728,"Protective features consistent with relatively good sleep quality are prominent across the self-report and wearable-derived data. The participant reports low depressive (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and trait anxiety scores (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23), both of which—given their positive correlations with PSQI in the sample—argue against symptom-driven sleep disturbance. Behavioral habits that typically support sleep are also present: regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more, Z = 1.07), almost no alcohol or recreational drug use (Z-scores from -0.11 to -1.30), essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), and relatively low recreational screen time. Wearable circadian and heart-rate metrics further reinforce preserved physiological sleep-wake structure: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.50, Z = 0.75), autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.45, Z = 1.06), amplitude from cosinor analysis is large (15.56, Z = 1.54), and intradaily variability is relatively low (0.47, Z = -0.53). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal fall (e.g., -20.9 bpm at 5–6am; -24.17 bpm at 6–7am) and clear daytime increases, which together indicate a robust nocturnal resting pattern and consolidated physiological quiescence at night—both features that typically correlate with lower PSQI scores.

Features that point toward potential contributors to poorer sleep quality are more circumscribed but relevant. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 01:05 AM), which can increase the likelihood of sleep complaints in contexts that demand earlier wake times; sleep start time variability is moderate (SD ≈ 93 minutes, Z = 0.21), and night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD = 92 minutes, Z = -0.21) indicates some inconsistency in sleep opportunity. Although overall nightly sleep duration is close to 7 hours (median 6 h 59 min, Z = -0.25), the slightly shortened average relative to a full 7–8 hour window and the late timing could interact with social or academic schedules to produce subjective sleep problems. Self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are below the study mean (happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.45), small psychosocial signals that—given modest positive correlations with PSQI in the sample—could contribute to worse perceived sleep for some individuals. Finally, the large evening physiological peak (notably 5–6pm deviation 27.42, Z = 2.47) suggests substantial evening-level physiological activation; depending on timing of exercise or other arousing activities, this could influence sleep onset latency for some people even though the hourly correlations with PSQI in the sample are small.

The circadian and physiological evidence should be read together: despite the late habitual bedtime, the participant’s heart-rate–based rhythm is relatively regular and of large amplitude, with a clear nocturnal trough and low fragmentation. Those features usually associate with better objective sleep consolidation and lower PSQI. Subjective and behavioral indicators (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, low substance use, regular exercise, minimal napping) further reduce the expected PSQI burden. Conversely, late sleep timing and some variability in sleep onset and duration are the principal behavioral risk factors that could elevate perceived sleep problems in contexts requiring early awakenings.

Holistic assessment: balancing the evidence, the participant’s overall sleep profile is more consistent with somewhat better-than-average sleep quality in this sample. Compared to the study population mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the pattern of low symptom burden, strong circadian regularity, consolidated nocturnal physiology, adequate median sleep duration, and limited substance use suggests a likely PSQI at or slightly below the population mean (i.e., better-than-average sleep quality), though not dramatically so. If improvement is sought, the most plausible targets are (1) shifting or regularizing bedtime earlier and reducing night-to-night variability in sleep start time, and (2) monitoring timing of late-day activating behaviors (e.g., intense evening exercise) that could delay sleep onset."
45076,"Summary of protective evidence (features associated with lower PSQI / better sleep): The participant shows objectively adequate total sleep time and limited daytime napping across the semester: median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 38 minutes (Z = +0.56 versus the study sample) and mean daily naps were negligible (0.07/day, Z ≈ 0), both findings that are typically associated with better subjective sleep. Health and lifestyle factors that tend to protect sleep are also present: body mass index is in the healthy range (21.9), reported alcohol and drug use are minimal (no beer, no recreational/non-prescribed drugs; modest wine use once–twice weekly), and exercise participation is high (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; sports three times a week or more; exercise Z-scores > +1). Psychological resources that are associated with better sleep in this sample are also evident: self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = +1.38, correlation with PSQI = −0.35), and depressive symptom score is not in the clinical range (CES-D = 15; classified “Not depressed”), both of which point toward factors that could support relatively good sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with higher PSQI (features associated with poorer sleep): Several psychological and circadian features in the record point toward elevated sleep disturbance risk. Perceived stress is markedly elevated (PSS = 29, Z = +2.01) and trait anxiety is above the sample mean (STAI = 44, Z = +0.27); both measures have positive correlations with PSQI in this study (PSS r ≈ +0.20; STAI r ≈ +0.40), indicating these states are likely to worsen subjective sleep. There is also some night-to-night variability: sleep duration standard deviation is substantial (96 minutes) and sleep start time standard deviation is ~63 minutes (Zs ≈ −0.1 and −0.44 respectively), and these variability metrics show modest positive correlations with PSQI (duration SD r ≈ +0.20; start-time SD r ≈ +0.18). Although total sleep time is adequate on average, variability in timing and duration is a known contributor to poorer subjective sleep quality and higher PSQI scores.

Circadian and physiological behavior (heart rate and rhythm) interpretation: Heart-rate derived circadian metrics indicate a moderately damped and somewhat irregular circadian structure. Interdaily stability is low (0.32, Z = −0.74), suggesting less consistent daily timing of physiological rhythms across days; intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.59, Z = +0.32), indicating more fragmentation within days. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (amplitude = 9.42, Z = −0.44), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (0.42, Z = +0.81) — together these suggest that while there is a repeating 24-hour pattern, its amplitude and day-to-day robustness are attenuated. Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (≈ −15 bpm between ~2:00–6:00 AM) consistent with physiological sleep, and large afternoon increases, particularly a strong peak at 4–5 PM (+24.96 bpm, Z = +2.40). The large late‑afternoon heart-rate elevation could reflect either late-day vigorous activity (exercise/sport) or sustained physiological/arousal responses later in the day; either pathway can influence sleep onset and quality, especially if arousal is present close to bedtime.

Balancing the evidence and likely effect on PSQI: The profile is mixed. Objective sleep duration and low napping, together with frequent exercise and minimal substance use, are robust protective indicators and argue against severe sleep disturbance. Counterbalancing these positives are elevated perceived stress, higher trait anxiety, reduced interdaily stability and a damped circadian amplitude, and measurable night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration — factors that have nontrivial correlations with higher PSQI scores in this sample (notably CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI are r ≈ +0.49 and +0.40 respectively; PSS r ≈ +0.20). The large late-afternoon heart-rate peak and moderate intradaily variability further support the possibility of physiologic/behavioral arousal patterns that could interfere with sleep consolidation or subjective sleep quality.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSQI: Considering both protective and risk features, the most consistent interpretation is that the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely close to the study mean but leaning slightly toward poorer sleep (i.e., near to slightly above the population mean PSQI of 6.73). The objective sleep quantity and low napping argue against markedly poor sleep, but elevated perceived stress and anxiety combined with reduced circadian stability and timing variability make it plausible that the participant’s PSQI would be somewhat higher than average rather than substantially lower. The strongest contributors pushing toward a higher PSQI are elevated PSS and STAI scores and reduced interdaily stability; the strongest contributors pulling toward a lower PSQI are adequate total sleep time, high exercise participation, and limited substance use."
44872,"The available multi-modal data show a mixture of behavioral, self-report, and physiological signals relevant to sleep quality. Objective sleep duration across the recording period is near seven hours (median 6 h 58 m; Z = -0.27), with very low average nap frequency (0.07/day). Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a clear diurnal heart-rate pattern with an acrophase in the mid-afternoon (2:42 PM) and a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reduction (nighttime hourly deviations commonly -13 to -21 bpm relative to the mesor). Resting heart rate and mesor are both relatively low (RHR 48.3 bpm, Z = -1.17; mesor 61.84, Z = -1.65), consistent with robust nocturnal restorative physiology. Self-report mood and affect measures (CES-D = 5, STAI = 39, Happy Z = 1.64, Self-Esteem Z = 0.68) are generally favorable and show correlations with PSQI that would predict lower (better) subjective sleep disturbance.

Factors that appear likely to contribute to a relatively higher PSQI score (poorer sleep quality): behavioral irregularity and variability. The participant shows elevated variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start time SD = 154 minutes, Z = 1.55; sleep-duration SD = 135 minutes, Z = 0.77), and circadian consistency metrics are modest to low (interdaily stability = 0.29, Z = -0.99; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.16, Z = -1.37). These features indicate inconsistent sleep schedules and day-to-day routines, which are commonly associated with worse sleep quality and are reflected here in modest positive correlations with PSQI. Alcohol consumption is relatively frequent (beer and wine/liquor reported three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.7), which can fragment sleep or impair subjective sleep quality in some individuals even though the study-level PSQI correlations for alcohol are small. Intradaily variability (0.61, Z = 0.46) is elevated, which can reflect daytime fragmentation and has been linked to poorer sleep. Several nocturnal hourly heart-rate deviations have weak positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., 3–4 AM deviation correlates r ≈ 0.23), consistent with the possibility of disturbed sleep physiology on some nights.

Factors that appear likely to contribute to a relatively lower PSQI score (better sleep quality): physiological signs of restorative sleep and generally good mental and physical health. The large nocturnal heart-rate declines (-13 to -21 bpm overnight) and a low resting heart rate are consistent with consolidated, physiologically restorative sleep on many recorded nights. Median total sleep time near seven hours, a very low nap frequency, regular exercise (exercising alone/with others three times a week or more; Z > 1), and favorable affective scores (low depressive symptoms, modest trait anxiety, high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction) all point toward relatively good sleep quality for many nights and reduced risk for chronically poor subjective sleep. The acrophase in the mid-afternoon and measurable amplitude indicate an identifiable circadian rhythm rather than its absence, which can be supportive of sleep consolidation when combined with the observed nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation.

Integrative assessment and comparison to the study population mean: the data present a mixed picture—strong signals of physiological rest and favorable psychosocial indicators on one hand, and meaningful behavioral irregularity plus relatively frequent alcohol use on the other. Taken together, these patterns are most consistent with an overall sleep profile that is comparable to the study sample average rather than clearly better or worse. Relative to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s profile would most appropriately be described as near the mean. In other words, objective physiology and affective health suggest protection against severe sleep problems, while irregular schedules and alcohol use represent plausible contributors to night-to-night disturbance that could raise subjective PSQI toward the sample average."
27306,"Summary of multimodal findings
The participant’s data show a mixed but overall favorable sleep profile when psychological, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological signals are considered together. Wearable-derived heart rate indices indicate a strong nocturnal decline in cardiovascular activity (large negative deviations from the mesor across the 12:00–6:00 AM window and a low resting heart rate of 46.2 bpm), and circadian amplitude is modestly elevated—both features consistent with consolidated, restorative nocturnal physiology. Self-report measures also point to protective psychological and lifestyle factors: low depressive symptoms (CES-D score = 6, Z = -0.76), modest trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43), high self‑esteem (RSES Z = 1.66) and high health satisfaction (Z = 1.8), regular exercise (three times per week or more), and minimal substance use. These elements are generally associated with lower PSQI scores in the study sample and with better subjective and objective sleep.

Evidence suggesting relatively poorer sleep (factors that would raise PSQI)
There are several features that could contribute to a higher PSQI (poorer sleep). Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 42 minutes (Z = -0.60), which is slightly shorter than typical adult recommendations and could increase subjective sleep complaints or daytime impairment for some people. Sleep timing is clustered near midnight (median sleep start ≈ 23:55) with a nontrivial night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 57 minutes), and circadian regularity metrics show modest irregularity: interdaily stability is slightly below the cohort mean (0.38, Z = -0.24) and intradaily variability is mildly elevated (0.59, Z = 0.32). These rhythm metrics can reflect day-to-day schedule variability or fragmented activity patterns and have been linked in the literature to poorer sleep quality. Finally, although nocturnal heart rate is strongly reduced overall, some aggregated hourly HR deviations in the evening and late night show less pronounced declines (e.g., 6–7 AM and several evening hours have smaller negative deviations), which could reflect residual arousal or late-day activity timing that interferes with sleep consolidation for some individuals.

Evidence suggesting relatively better sleep (factors that would lower PSQI)
Several robust indicators point toward relatively good sleep quality. The large, consistent nocturnal heart‑rate reductions (nighttime deviations from mesor of roughly -20 to -30 bpm) and a low resting heart rate (Z = -1.42) are physiologically consistent with nightly recovery and with lower sleep disturbance. The participant reports low depressive and anxiety symptom burden—measures that show relatively strong positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (e.g., CES‑D correlation ≈ 0.49)—so their low symptom levels are protective. Regular exercise, minimal alcohol and drug use, low napping frequency (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08), and relatively low day‑time sedentary/recreational screen time are lifestyle patterns typically associated with better subjective sleep. The circadian amplitude is slightly above average (amplitude Z = 0.46) and the acrophase (~1:53 PM) is within a typical daytime window, which together argue for intact day–night differentiation.

Integrated conclusion and comparison to the study sample
Balancing the evidence, the participant exhibits several strong protective signs for sleep (robust nocturnal HR decline, low resting HR, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, frequent exercise, and low substance use), coupled with a few modest risk features (slightly short median sleep duration, some variability in sleep start time, and mild reductions in interdaily stability/increased intradaily variability). Taken together, the preponderance of indicators suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is somewhat better than the average study participant. Therefore, relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s inferred sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., better-than-average sleep quality). This conclusion is probabilistic: objective physiology and favorable psychosocial profiles point toward lower PSQI, whereas marginal short sleep and mild circadian irregularity indicate some potential vulnerability that could elevate PSQI under stress or schedule change."
46365,"Overall impression and comparison to the study sample:
Based on the combined self-report and wearable-derived data, the participant’s profile contains a mix of factors that both increase and decrease the likelihood of poorer sleep quality. On balance, the preponderance of risk indicators (late and variable sleep timing, signs of pre-sleep physiological activation, moderate trait anxiety, frequent beer use and high evening screen time, and more frequent napping) outweigh the protective factors (adequate median sleep duration, relatively low resting heart rate, high self-esteem). Taken holistically, the pattern is most consistent with sleep quality that is modestly worse than the study population average — i.e., likely above the population mean PSQI of 6.73 (worse sleep quality than the sample mean), rather than near or below it.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher (worse) PSQI:
- Sleep timing and sleep timing variability: The median sleep start time of 01:34 (01:34 AM) indicates a late habitual bedtime. Later bedtimes are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and misalignment with daytime schedules. The sleep-start SD (~62 minutes) shows some night-to-night variability in timing that can impair sleep consolidation. 
- Signs of pre-sleep physiological arousal: Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated heart rate relative to the mesor in the late evening/night window (notably 11:00–12:00am deviation = +15.45, Z = 1.79; 12:00–1:00am = +10.33, Z = 1.73). These elevated cardiac values close to habitual sleep onset are consistent with physiological activation or delayed down-regulation before sleep and are plausibly related to worse subjective sleep quality. 
- Psychological and behavioral risk factors: Trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) and modest perceived stress (PSS = 20) are both associated in this sample with higher PSQI; the STAI score in particular has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.40), suggesting anxiety-related hyperarousal may contribute to worse sleep. Frequent beer consumption (reported “three times a week or more,” Z = 1.72) and extensive daily internet use (>4 hours, Z = 2.19) are behavioral correlates that tend to increase PSQI in the sample (though their individual correlations with PSQI are small). Increased mean daily naps (0.17 naps/day, Z = 1.09) also correlates positively with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.18) and may reflect or contribute to nocturnal sleep disruption. 
- Subjective health and mood: Lower self-rated health satisfaction (score 2.33, Z = -1.45) and lower momentary happiness (score 3.0, Z = -0.53) are associated with poorer sleep in the sample; these features therefore add to the evidence toward higher PSQI.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower (better) PSQI:
- Adequate total sleep time and relatively stable duration: Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 16 minutes (Z = 0.11), which is within the commonly recommended range and is similar to the study average. Night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD = 91 minutes, Z = -0.23) does not appear elevated compared with the sample, and overall duration is therefore a protective factor against poor PSQI. 
- Cardiorespiratory fitness and baseline physiology: Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.8 bpm, Z = -0.28), which often co-occurs with better general cardiovascular fitness and may be protective for sleep consolidation. The cosinor amplitude is modest (amplitude ≈ 10.9, Z = 0.03) and MESOR is modestly above mean (MESOR ≈ 77.1, Z = 0.43) but none of these circadian summary metrics show strong correlations with PSQI in this sample; thus, there is not a strong objective circadian marker indicating poor sleep. 
- Positive self-regard: High self-esteem (Rosenberg = 40, Z = 0.26) is negatively correlated with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ -0.35), suggesting a psychosocial buffer that could mitigate subjective sleep complaints.

Physiological circadian pattern and its implications:
- Circadian regularity metrics are somewhat below sample averages: interdaily stability (0.30, Z = -0.90) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.16, Z = -1.37) are lower than the study mean, suggesting that day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms is reduced. Intradaily variability is low (0.36, Z = -1.31), which would usually indicate less within-day fragmentation, but the combination of lower interdaily stability and low autocorrelation points to weaker day-to-day rhythm consistency. These circadian irregularities are only weakly correlated with PSQI in the sample (correlations near zero), so while they indicate potential circadian disruption, their direct link to subjective sleep problems in this dataset is modest.
- Timing of the circadian peak (acrophase ≈ 6:09 PM) and the pattern of hourly deviations are broadly typical for an evening-active schedule; however, the relatively high evening heart-rate deviations (noted above) imply delayed physiological down-regulation before sleep onset.

Holistic synthesis and practical interpretation:
The participant shows a mixed profile: objectively adequate sleep duration and relatively low resting heart rate are protective, but late habitual sleep timing, evidence of elevated heart rate close to bedtime, moderate trait anxiety, frequent alcohol use, high evening internet use, and somewhat lower day-to-day circadian regularity increase the likelihood of greater subjective sleep disturbance. Given the balance of evidence, the data most consistently point to a small-to-moderate elevation in risk for poorer sleep relative to the study sample average; in other words, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI (worse sleep quality than average) rather than near or below it. The strongest actionable signals in the data are (1) late timing and pre-sleep physiological arousal and (2) behavioral contributors (alcohol frequency, evening screen time, and napping) that could be targeted to improve subjective sleep quality."
23287,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of features associated with both relatively good and relatively poor sleep quality. Objectively, wearable-derived sleep duration is long (median 8 h 23 min; Z = +1.49) and the participant shows robust nocturnal heart-rate suppression (hourly heart-rate deviations of roughly -27 bpm across 3–7 AM), a low resting heart rate (40.6 bpm; Z = -2.09), and reasonably regular circadian structure (interdaily stability = 0.45, Z = +0.33; amplitude modestly above average, Z = +0.56). Subjective symptom measures are also generally favorable (CES-D = 6, STAI-trait = 37, and Perceived Stress = 18 are all below the study mean/Z-average), and substance use is absent. Together these features point toward preserved sleep opportunity, good cardiorespiratory fitness, and low global symptom burden — factors that tend to correspond with lower (better) PSQI scores.

Features suggesting higher PSQI (poorer sleep): several indicators point to aspects of sleep that could increase global PSQI. Sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ~00:56) and there are pronounced evening elevations in heart rate (9–11 PM deviations: 19.97 to 21.52 bpm; Zs ≈ +2.1–2.4), which may reflect physiological arousal in the late evening and are plausibly linked to difficulties initiating or consolidating sleep. Night-to-night variability in total sleep is elevated (sleep duration SD = 130 minutes; Z = +0.67) and the participant naps relatively often for this sample (mean daily naps = 0.25; Z = +2.07); both of these features have positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (sleep variability r ≈ 0.21; naps r ≈ 0.19) and typically associate with worse subjective sleep quality. Modest intradaily variability in circadian heart-rate patterns (IV = 0.57, Z = +0.17) and fairly late acrophase (5:03 PM) may also indicate some circadian misalignment relative to individuals with the best sleep quality.

Features suggesting lower PSQI (better sleep): the participant’s long median sleep duration (8 h 23 min, Z = +1.49), strong nocturnal heart-rate dipping (large negative nighttime deviations), low mesor and resting heart rate (mesor = 57.82, Z = -2.20; resting HR 40.6 bpm, Z = -2.09), and moderate-to-good interdaily stability are all consistent with consolidated nocturnal sleep and high autonomic recovery overnight. Low scores on depressive and anxiety symptom scales and high health satisfaction (health satisfaction Z = +1.71) further support better subjective well-being, which typically corresponds to lower PSQI. Low substance and recreational drug use and relatively regular exercise (especially exercising with others, Z ≈ +1.23) are additional behavioral factors that favor better sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study mean: weighing the evidence, the participant shows strong protective signals for sleep quality (long objective sleep time, marked nocturnal cardiac recovery, low symptom burden, low substance use) but also has notable risk features (late sleep timing, elevated late-evening physiological arousal, greater night-to-night sleep variability, and above-average napping). On balance these patterns are more consistent with sleep quality that is at least as good as — and likely somewhat better than — the study population average. Stated relative to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the participant’s profile is most consistent with a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., somewhat better-than-average sleep quality), though not by a large margin given the countervailing indicators of timing variability and evening arousal. 

Interpretive caveats: hourly heart-rate deviations are aggregated across days and cannot be used to infer night-to-night dynamics; PSQI inference here relies on convergent indicators rather than a direct PSQI score. The combination of long total sleep time with evidence of late timing and timing variability suggests that interventions targeting earlier or more consistent bedtimes (and reducing late-evening physiological activation or evening screen time) could further reduce the residual sleep-related risk factors."
28247,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics, the participant shows a mixed profile in which several robust psychosocial and circadian markers point toward compromised sleep quality while a smaller set of behavioral features appear potentially protective. Prominent features include elevated depressive (CES-D = 29; Z = 1.63) and trait anxiety symptoms (STAI = 61; Z = 1.95), a median nightly sleep duration below 7 hours (6 h 26 m; Z = -0.94), a late median sleep start (~01:03) with very high night-to-night variability in bedtime (sleep start SD = 208 minutes; Z = 2.74), and wearable circadian indices indicative of a weakened, irregular rhythm (low interdaily stability = 0.23, Z = -1.48; high intradaily variability = 0.76, Z = 1.51; reduced amplitude = 5.8, Z = -1.61). Taken together, these elements form a coherent pattern that is commonly associated with higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores in population studies.

Factors consistent with relatively poorer sleep (likely to increase PSQI): Psychological distress is a strong signal—both depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) are well above sample means and have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating these symptoms are likely contributing to subjective sleep complaints. Circadian disruption on the wearable is evident: low interdaily stability (irregular day-to-day rhythm), elevated intradaily variability (fragmentation of activity/physiology across the day), and reduced circadian amplitude suggest attenuated and unstable 24-hour structure—features that are linked to poorer sleep quality. Behavioral sleep markers reinforce this risk: median sleep start after 1:00 a.m. and a large sleep-start SD indicate both late and highly inconsistent bedtimes (bedtime variability correlates positively with PSQI r ≈ 0.18). Shorter median sleep duration (≈6.4 hours) and moderately variable nightly durations (SD ≈ 119 minutes) also align with poorer objective and subjective sleep reported in other samples. Several hourly heart-rate deviations around the overnight period (notably strong negative deviations between ~2–6 a.m.) and modestly elevated resting heart rate (62.2 bpm; Z = 0.48) are compatible with a profile of altered nocturnal physiology that can accompany fragmented or insufficient sleep.

Factors consistent with relatively better sleep (likely to decrease PSQI): There are some protective or neutral features. Substance use is low (alcohol and drugs use below or near population norms), and the participant reports no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0; Z = -0.86), which may help consolidate nighttime sleep. Resting heart rate is within a typical range and only modestly elevated relative to the sample (Z ≈ 0.48), which does not strongly indicate chronic physiological hyperarousal. Social activity and reported happiness show some positive values (e.g., socializing with friends “>4 hours,” Happiness Z = 0.55) that could reflect social support or rewarding daytime engagement—possible buffers against severe subjective sleep impairment. Correlations in the dataset suggest some of these features have weak or mixed relationships with PSQI, meaning they may partially offset risk but do not strongly predict excellent sleep in this case.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing all evidence, the participant’s pattern—markedly elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, late and highly variable bedtimes, sub-7-hour median sleep, and wearable indices of low circadian stability and reduced amplitude—points to an overall sleep-quality level that is likely worse than the study sample mean. In probabilistic terms, the profile is most consistent with a PSQI score above the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72), rather than near or below it. This inference is supported by the relatively large z-scores for psychological distress and bedtime irregularity and by circadian-wearable features that have been associated with higher PSQI scores in this cohort.

Limitations: This synthesis integrates trait/ symptom scales, aggregated wearable circadian metrics, and summary sleep statistics but does not use a directly recorded PSQI score for the participant. Associations cited are correlational; causal conclusions cannot be drawn from these cross-sectional/aggregated data alone."
72806,"Summary overview: The multimodal data indicate a pattern of generally regular, physiologically restorative sleep with several behavioral and psychometric features that align with relatively good sleep quality, along with a few modest signals that could contribute to occasional sleep disturbance. Objective wearable metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 34 minutes (Z = 0.47), low-to-moderate night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start time SD = 68 minutes, Z = -0.32) and duration (SD = 85 minutes, Z = -0.36), and relatively low mean daily napping (0.13 naps/day, Z = 0.7). Heart-rate–based circadian measures are consistent with a robust and regular rhythm: interdaily stability = 0.47 (Z = 0.50) and amplitude = 12.52 (Z = 0.56). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal decline in mean heart rate (largest deviations ~ -22 bpm between ~2:00–5:00 AM), and a low resting heart rate of 56.4 bpm (Z = -0.21), both of which typically indicate good physiological downregulation during sleep.

Evidence pointing toward relatively good sleep quality: Several objective indicators align with healthier sleep. Total nightly sleep is above 7 hours (median 7:34), which is in the range associated with better subjective sleep. Nighttime cardiac profile shows a pronounced nocturnal dip (large negative deviations relative to the mesor between midnight and early morning) and a low resting heart rate, both consistent with consolidated, restorative sleep physiology. Circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = 0.50) and relatively high amplitude (Z = 0.56) suggest a well-entrained daily rhythm, and sleep timing variability is slightly lower than the study mean, supporting consistent sleep scheduling. Psychometric measures that typically covary with better sleep also favor a favorable profile: low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82), and slightly above-average self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.11). Low substance use and modest physical activity further support reduced risk of chronic sleep disruption.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality: A few signals could relate to episodic or subtle sleep disturbance. Mean daily nap frequency is slightly elevated relative to the population (Z = 0.70) and correlates modestly with worse PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.17), suggesting some compensatory daytime sleep. There is an unusually large positive heart-rate deviation in the early evening (6–7 PM value = +25.34, Z = 2.22), which may indicate periods of late-day physiological activation (intense exercise, stress, or social activity) that could, for some people, interfere with sleep onset. Self-reported health satisfaction is below the study mean (Z = -0.70), and while perceived stress is near or slightly below average (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17), these subjective factors have modest associations with sleep difficulty in the sample. Finally, although night-to-night variability in this participant is lower than average, the positive correlation of variability measures with PSQI in the cohort (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20; start-time SD r ≈ 0.18) indicates that any increases in inconsistency could contribute to worse sleep if they occurred.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study sample: Balancing the objective and self-report evidence, the preponderance of indicators (sufficient median sleep duration, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline, low resting heart rate, above-average circadian stability and amplitude, low mood and anxiety scores) point toward overall sleep quality that is better than the study population average. Compared with the study sample PSQI mean of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the aggregated pattern for this participant is most consistent with a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., relatively lower PSQI score, indicating comparatively better sleep quality). Caveats: this inference integrates cross-sectional, aggregated wearable data and single-time self-report surveys; PSQI itself was not listed among the provided values, and some modest signals (evening HR spike, slight increase in naps, lower health satisfaction) could presage intermittent or context-dependent disruption. Monitoring for changes in sleep timing consistency, evening arousal, or increased daytime napping would be useful to detect any shift toward poorer sleep."
39146,"Summary of indicators associated with poorer sleep quality
The participant’s profile contains several measurable features that are plausibly associated with higher PSQI scores (worse subjective sleep). Sleep timing is late: the median sleep start time is 01:32 AM, which, combined with a median nightly sleep duration of 6 h 48 min (Z = -0.47), suggests truncated sleep opportunity and circadian misalignment; both later bedtime and shorter sleep duration have been associated with poorer PSQI in this dataset. Self-report measures show elevated perceived stress (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92; PSQI correlation = 0.20) and a modestly elevated trait anxiety score (STAI = 42; PSQI correlation = 0.40), which are both linked here to worse sleep. Wearable physiology also provides signals consistent with greater nocturnal arousal or physiological load: resting heart rate is above the sample mean (65.4 bpm, Z = 0.86) and the mesor of heart rate is elevated (Z = 0.61); resting/tonic cardiovascular elevation in this study is positively correlated with PSQI (small-to-moderate correlations reported). Finally, the participant reports very low frequency of exercise (Z ≈ -1.2) and relatively high sedentary/recreational screen time (video games Z = 2.47; Internet/music/ sedentary hobby elevated), lifestyle patterns that often accompany poorer sleep in this sample.

Summary of indicators associated with better sleep quality
There are also several objective and subjective features that tend to relate to lower PSQI (better sleep). Sleep regularity in duration appears favorable: night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD = 62 minutes, Z = -0.89), and mean daily napping is effectively zero (Z = -0.86), both characteristics that reduce fragmentation of nocturnal sleep. Circadian stability metrics are generally intact or above average: interdaily stability (Z = 0.42) and especially autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.15) indicate a consistent daily rhythm in heart-rate patterns across days, which in this dataset trends toward better sleep. The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows a clear nocturnal decline (deepest deviations at 2–3 AM ≈ -16.7 bpm), consistent with preserved nocturnal physiological lowering of arousal. In addition, the participant reports no use of alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs (strongly protective in this sample) and reports relatively high self-esteem and health satisfaction (self-esteem Z = 0.68; health satisfaction Z = 0.38), both of which correlate negatively with PSQI in the cohort.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population
Taken together, the strongest risk signals for poorer sleep are the late habitual sleep timing (median start ~01:30), shorter-than-recommended median sleep duration, elevated perceived stress and trait anxiety (each of which shows moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample), and a modestly elevated resting heart rate. Counterbalancing these risks are relatively low night-to-night duration variability, an absence of naps and substance use, and a reasonably stable circadian heart-rate rhythm (high 24-hour autocorrelation and positive interdaily stability) that indicate physiological regularity and preserved nocturnal heart-rate dip. Because several of the variables most strongly correlated with PSQI in this dataset (notably depressive symptoms and trait anxiety) are only modestly elevated here and protective features (regular sleep duration, no naps, strong day-to-day rhythm) are present, the overall pattern is mixed but leans toward somewhat worse sleep than the average study participant.

Compared to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.73), the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely to be above the population mean (i.e., somewhat poorer sleep than average), though not extremely so. The primary contributors to that inference are late habitual sleep timing combined with elevated stress/anxiety and higher resting heart rate; the participant’s regularity and lack of naps/substance use reduce the likely magnitude of impairment."
67918,"Objective wearable and sleep-timing data indicate a pattern consistent with relatively good sleep consolidation and stable circadian organization. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 42 minutes (Z = 1.88), well above the study mean, and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is modest (sleep start SD 55 minutes, sleep duration SD 74 minutes; both Z ≈ -0.6), suggesting reasonably consistent bedtimes and sleep length. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate further support strong rhythmicity: high interdaily stability (0.59, Z = 1.49), high autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.52, Z = 1.65), a relatively large amplitude (15.71, Z = 1.59), and low intradaily variability (0.37, Z = -1.24). The hourly aggregated heart-rate profile shows a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest deviations from mesor −20 to −23 bpm between ~2–4 AM), which is commonly associated with intact nocturnal autonomic downregulation and consolidated sleep.

Self-report and lifestyle measures largely align with indicators of favorable sleep. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5; Z = −0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 35; Z = −0.62), both of which are variables that, in this sample, correlate positively with worse PSQI but are low here. Self-esteem and health satisfaction are relatively high (RSES Z = 1.38; health satisfaction Z = 1.22), and substance use is negligible (alcohol and drug use = “not at all,” Z-scores strongly negative). These psychosocial features—combined with consistent sleep timing and strong circadian measures—would be expected to favor a lower (better) PSQI score.

There are a few features that could confer increased risk for poorer sleep quality, although their magnitude and consistency are limited. Physical activity is infrequent (exercise alone and with others reported 1–2 times per month; Z-scores modestly negative), which is a behavioral factor linked to worse sleep in some studies and could attenuate restorative sleep over time. Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly elevated relative to the sample (resting HR = 62.8, Z = 0.55; mesor Z = 1.0); these elevations are small and their correlations with PSQI in this dataset are weak, but they could reflect slightly higher baseline physiological arousal. Subjective happiness is slightly below the sample mean (current happiness Z = −0.53), which—if persistent—might also contribute to worsened sleep for some individuals. Importantly, most available correlations between these physiological measures and PSQI are small, so none of the adverse indicators here are strong or definitive on their own.

Integrating the multimodal evidence, the balance of objective and self-report markers points toward sleep quality that is likely better than the average participant in this sample. The participant’s long median sleep duration, low nap use, stable and high-amplitude circadian rhythm, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate trough, and low mood/anxiety symptom scores together favor a relatively low PSQI score. Compared to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the profile most plausibly corresponds to a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., comparatively better sleep). This inference should be interpreted with caution: limited physical activity and slightly elevated baseline cardiac metrics are modest risk factors that could influence sleep over time, and direct PSQI self-report (if available) remains the definitive measure."
34467,"Summary: The multimodal data present a mixed but overall favorable sleep profile. Objective nightly sleep duration is adequate (median 7 h 24 min; Z = +0.28) and the participant reports low symptoms of depression and trait anxiety (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66; STAI = 33, Z = -0.82). Fitness-related physiology is pronounced (resting heart rate 45.6 bpm; Z = -1.49; mesor 58.35, Z = -2.13), and health/behavioral indicators that typically protect sleep are present (regular exercise with others multiple times/week, Z = +1.23; low alcohol/drug use; health satisfaction Z = +0.8; high self-reported happiness Z = +1.64). At the same time, circadian and timing metrics show notable irregularity (interdaily stability = 0.30, Z = -0.90; intradaily variability = 0.75, Z = +1.44) and substantial night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start time SD ≈ 134 minutes, Z = +1.12; sleep duration SD ≈ 128 minutes, Z = +0.61). Below I summarize evidence that would tend to increase versus decrease PSQI (poorer vs. better sleep quality) and then provide a holistic assessment relative to the study sample mean PSQI (population mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16).

Features consistent with higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality)
- Timing irregularity and fragmentation: Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.30, Z = -0.90) and intradaily variability is elevated (0.75, Z = +1.44). These circadian features typically reflect weaker day-to-day regularity and more fragmented activity/rest cycles, which are associated with worse subjective sleep quality in prior work. 
- Night-to-night inconsistency: The participant’s sleep start time standard deviation (~134 minutes, Z = +1.12) and sleep duration SD (~128 minutes, Z = +0.61) indicate sizeable variability in bedtime and time-in-bed across the recording period. Greater variability in timing and duration has modest positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (sleep duration SD corr ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD corr ≈ 0.18), so these features would tend to push PSQI upward.
- Physiological rapid transitions: The hourly heart-rate deviations show very large nocturnal dips (e.g., 4–5 AM deviation ≈ -24 bpm, Z ≈ -1.0 to -2.1) and pronounced morning increases (notably 7–9 AM with Z-scores 3.24 and 2.26), suggesting a strong but potentially abrupt transition from low nocturnal arousal to diurnal activation. If these transitions are accompanied by inconsistent sleep timing, they can be experienced as fragmented or less restorative sleep.

Features consistent with lower PSQI (better sleep quality)
- Adequate total sleep time: Median nightly sleep of 7 h 24 min (Z = +0.28) is in the range commonly associated with restorative sleep and is above the sample median. This objective duration is a robust protective factor against high PSQI scores.
- Low affective symptom burden: CES-D and STAI scores are both below the sample mean (CES-D Z = -0.66; STAI Z = -0.82). Depression symptoms in this dataset have a relatively strong positive correlation with PSQI (CES-D–PSQI corr ≈ 0.50), so the participant’s low depressive symptom burden is an important indicator favoring better subjective sleep quality.
- Health and behavior supports: Low substance use (no reported alcohol or recreational drug use), frequent social exercise (Z = +1.23), good health satisfaction (Z = +0.8), and relatively high self-reported happiness (Z = +1.64) are behavioral/psychological features that typically relate to improved sleep quality. Resting heart rate and low mesor (Zs ≈ -1.5 to -2.1) suggest good cardiovascular fitness, which often accompanies better sleep continuity and daytime functioning.
- Objective nocturnal heart-rate reduction: The marked nocturnal HR reduction (large negative deviations vs. mesor) is consistent with physiologic sleep and parasympathetic dominance overnight, which can reflect high sleep depth if consolidated.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to sample mean PSQI
Taking the full pattern together, the evidence leans toward better-than-average sleep quality for this participant. Protective signals are strong: adequate objective sleep duration, low depressive and anxiety symptoms (and CES-D in particular is one of the stronger sample-level predictors of PSQI), low substance use, frequent exercise, and physiological signs of fitness and robust nocturnal autonomic down-regulation. Countervailing signals—most importantly elevated intradaily variability and large night-to-night variability in bedtime and sleep duration—indicate a risk of worse subjective sleep or of intermittent poorer nights. Because the depressive/anxiety and duration indicators are relatively strong predictors of PSQI in the dataset and are favorable for this participant, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall PSQI is likely below the population mean (i.e., better sleep quality than the average study participant). In other words, relative to the study sample mean PSQI = 6.72, this participant’s profile would predict a PSQI somewhat below that value (better sleep), albeit not without risk from timing/regularity factors.

Limitations and uncertainty
This inference is probabilistic and subject to limitations: no direct reported PSQI score is included here, and circadian instability and large timing variability are known to drive poor subjective sleep for some individuals even when average duration and mood are good. If clinical or research decisions depend on precise PSQI classification, obtaining the participant’s self-reported PSQI and collecting context around night-to-night variability (work/school schedules, shift obligations, or episodic stressors) would reduce uncertainty."
59673,"Overview: The available multimodal data indicate a pattern of nocturnal sleep that is sufficient in duration on average but relatively irregular in timing and day-to-day structure. Wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 37 minutes (Z = 0.54), with a late median sleep start time around 01:21 AM and elevated night-to-night variability in both sleep duration (SD = 144 minutes, Z = 0.98) and sleep start time (SD = 98 minutes, Z = 0.33). Circadian summary measures derived from heart rate show modest interdaily stability (0.42, Z = 0.09) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (0.57, Z = 0.17), while the 24-hour autocorrelation of the rhythm is relatively low (0.24, Z = −0.70). Self-report measures show low depressive and anxiety symptom scores (CES-D = 7, STAI-T = 37), high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66) and only modest perceived stress (PSS = 22, Z = 0.10). Taken together, these elements point to a sleeper who generally obtains adequate total sleep but does so on an irregular schedule with some physiological signs of altered circadian regularity.

Evidence suggesting higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): Several features are associated with increased PSQI risk in the study sample and are present here. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD 144 min, Z ≈ 1.0) and correlates positively with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.20); irregular sleep timing (median start after 1:00 AM and SD ≈ 98 minutes) is also associated with worse PSQI (correlation ~0.18). The low 24-hour autocorrelation of heart-rate rhythms (Z = −0.70) indicates reduced day-to-day regularity of physiological rhythms, which is commonly linked to poorer subjective sleep. Wearable hourly heart-rate deviations show an elevated late-night/early-midnight heart rate (e.g., 12–1am and 11pm–12am deviations are among the largest Z-scores), which could reflect pre-sleep physiological arousal around typical sleep onset times and has modest positive correlations with PSQI in these hours. Increased mean daily naps (0.18, Z = 1.27) and weekly alcohol intake (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94) are behavioral factors that can fragment nocturnal sleep and are modestly associated with worse PSQI in the sample. Collectively, these irregular timing, variability, and pre-sleep arousal indicators point toward mechanisms that would elevate the participant’s PSQI score relative to people with more regular sleep patterns.

Evidence suggesting lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Conversely, several measures support relatively good sleep-related functioning. Median total sleep time is in the healthy range (≈7 hr 37 min, Z = 0.54), and resting heart rate is relatively low (57.2 bpm, Z = −0.11), which is typically consistent with adequate restorative sleep or good cardiovascular fitness. Psychological measures that correlate with better sleep—low depressive symptoms (CES-D low; note CES-D correlates positively with PSQI, r ≈ 0.50) and modest trait anxiety (STAI-T below the sample mean)—are present and tend to protect against high PSQI. High self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66; RSES correlates negatively with PSQI in the sample) and relatively low engagement in stimulants or recreational drug use further support the likelihood of subjectively better sleep for some nights. These positive psychological and physiological indicators would, all else equal, be expected to lower the participant’s PSQI score.

Interpretation of circadian and physiological metrics: Heart-rate–based circadian markers show a clear nocturnal decline in aggregate heart rate (large negative deviations from mesor across ~2–6 AM), consistent with a normal nocturnal physiological dip. However, the timing of activity-related peaks and elevated late-evening heart-rate deviations (e.g., 6–7 PM and midnight hour elevations) combined with low 24-hour autocorrelation suggest that the participant’s circadian rhythm is present but not strongly time-locked day-to-day. Interdaily stability near the sample mean but reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation implies that while there is a rhythm, its phase or amplitude shifts across days; this instability is a plausible contributor to subjective sleep complaints even when total sleep time is adequate on average.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows meaningful protective factors (adequate median sleep duration, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, favorable resting heart rate, and high self-esteem) but also notable risk factors for poorer subjective sleep (late and variable sleep timing, elevated night-to-night variability in duration, increased napping, weekly alcohol use, and reduced 24-hour rhythm consistency). On balance, these patterns suggest an overall sleep quality that is likely near to modestly worse than the study sample average. Using the study sample PSQI context (population mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the composite evidence is most consistent with an inferred PSQI level that is “near the mean” to “slightly above the population mean” (i.e., somewhat poorer sleep quality than average in this sample), rather than markedly better.

Key actionable points to clarify in follow-up: if the goal is to reduce PSQI, addressing circadian regularity and pre-sleep arousal would likely have the greatest impact given the current profile: establishing a more consistent sleep-wake schedule, reducing late-night alcohol or stimulating activities, and targeting factors that precede the typical 1:00 AM sleep onset may reduce variability and subjective sleep complaints."
74899,"Summary of key behavioral and physiological observations: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 5 hours 58 minutes (Z = -1.52), with a consistently late median sleep start time near 02:25 AM and a moderate night-to-night sleep onset variability (SD ≈ 65 minutes, Z ≈ -0.38). The participant reports essentially no naps. Circadian measures derived from heart rate indicate a clear nocturnal decline in heart rate (hourly deviations from the mesor are strongly negative from ~2:00–8:00 AM, reaching ~-20 bpm at 5–6 AM), a MESOR of 80.9 bpm (Z = 0.95), amplitude of 12.45 (Z = 0.54), acrophase around 5:49 PM, interdaily stability ~0.43 (Z = 0.17), and intradaily variability ~0.61 (Z = 0.46). Psychological self-report shows elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = 1.06), elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z = 0.38), and high perceived stress (PSS = 30, Z = 2.28). Health satisfaction, exercise frequency, and minimal recreational drug use are also notable.

Features that plausibly indicate poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The objectively short median sleep duration (≈6 hours) and late habitual sleep onset are both established risk factors for reduced sleep quality and daytime impairment; this short duration is substantially below the study mean (Z = -1.52). Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores (STAI and CES-D) and markedly high perceived stress are salient psychological correlates that, in this dataset, show moderate positive correlations with PSQI (STAI r ≈ 0.40; CES-D r ≈ 0.49). Intradaily variability of heart rate is modestly elevated (Z ≈ 0.46), indicating more fragmented or less consolidated activity/rest structure across the day, which can relate to poorer subjective sleep. The combination of late sleep timing and psychological stress/anxiety increases the likelihood of sleep latency, awakenings, or nonrestorative sleep even if some physiological markers appear normal.

Features that plausibly indicate better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Several wearable-derived physiological markers are consistent with preserved nocturnal physiological recovery: pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dips (~-10 to -20 bpm relative to the mesor between ~2–7 AM) suggest intact overnight autonomic downregulation. Interdaily stability is near the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.17), indicating a reasonably regular day-to-day rhythm, and the participant reports no daytime napping, which reduces the potential for sleep disruption at night. Behavioral protective factors include regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.07) and low recreational drug use; self-reported health satisfaction is relatively high (Z ≈ 1.3). Resting heart rate is modestly above average (62.1 bpm, Z ≈ 0.47) but not extreme.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Taking the full multimodal profile together, the balance of evidence suggests that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely worse than average in the study sample. The most influential signals pointing toward an elevated PSQI are the objectively short median sleep duration (≈6 hours), the consistently late sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:25 AM), and the participant’s elevated anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress—variables that show the strongest correlations with PSQI in this dataset. Countervailing evidence (intact nocturnal heart-rate dipping, reasonable interdaily stability, regular exercise, low substance use, and no naps) mitigate but do not fully offset the risk conveyed by short sleep and high psychological distress. Compared to the population mean PSQI of 6.72, the participant’s profile is best characterized as “above the population mean” (i.e., suggesting poorer-than-average sleep quality) based on the combination of short sleep duration, late timing, and elevated emotional distress."
35011,"Summary of available data and approach: The dataset integrates self-report measures (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, self‑esteem, perceived stress, health satisfaction, substance use, activity patterns) with wearable-derived sleep timing and duration, hourly heart rate deviations, and summary circadian metrics (cosinor and non‑parametric features). In interpreting likely effects on PSQI-measured sleep quality, I weighted indicators with stronger established links to PSQI in this sample (e.g., CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49) and emphasized objective wearable features that index sleep opportunity/timing, circadian regularity, and physiological arousal (sleep duration and timing, interdaily stability, intradaily variability, amplitude, resting heart rate).

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several convergent signals point toward worse-than-average sleep. Objective sleep opportunity is reduced: median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 5 min (Z = -1.37), substantially below the study mean and associated with shorter sleep opportunity. Sleep timing is late and shifted: the median sleep start time is 02:34 AM, indicating a delayed sleep period that may reduce alignment with typical daytime demands. Circadian structure derived from heart rate is weak and irregular: interdaily stability is low (0.17, Z = -1.98) and amplitude is low (4.29, Z = -2.10), suggesting poor day‑to‑day regularity and a flattened circadian signal—both features that are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep. Physiological arousal is elevated: resting heart rate is high (77.6 bpm, Z = 2.31), which can reflect higher autonomic arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness and has been linked to worse sleep. Finally, depressive symptom severity (CES‑D = 20, Z = 0.7) is moderate-to-elevated and, in this sample, correlates fairly strongly with PSQI (r = 0.49), making mood-related sleep disruption a plausible contributor.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): There are some features that temper the negative signals. Night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration and in timing is not extreme relative to the sample (sleep duration SD = 63 minutes, Z = -0.87; sleep start SD = 70 minutes, Z = -0.28), which suggests the participant does not have highly erratic sleep length compared with peers. Daytime compensatory behavior appears limited (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), so daytime napping is unlikely to be a major driver of nocturnal fragmentation. Self‑reported stress on the PSS is below sample mean (score = 18, Z = -0.98), and current happiness is modestly above average (Z = 0.55); both findings could buffer sleep disruption for some individuals. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Z = 0.96) and, in this dataset, higher self‑esteem is moderately associated with better sleep (r = -0.35), which could be protective.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the predominant pattern is one of constrained sleep opportunity (short median sleep duration and very late sleep onset), flattened and unstable circadian physiology (low amplitude and low interdaily stability), and elevated resting heart rate—all of which are empirically associated with poorer subjective sleep and higher PSQI in the literature and in the current sample (notably the strong CES‑D—PSQI correlation). Protective signs (limited napping, modestly lower perceived stress, and higher self‑esteem) do not fully counterbalance these risks. Therefore, the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s overall sleep quality would be above the population mean PSQI score (i.e., poorer sleep than average in this sample). The study population mean PSQI is 6.72 (SD 2.16); given the combination of short sleep duration (Z = -1.37), late timing, circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z = -1.98; amplitude Z = -2.10), and elevated resting heart rate (Z = 2.31), the participant’s PSQI is likely to exceed the sample mean rather than lie near or below it.

Practical implications to consider from the profile (no clinical recommendations): the data suggest targets that, if modified, commonly yield improvements in sleep quality—earlier and more consistent sleep timing, interventions to strengthen daily routine/regularity (increase interdaily stability), and approaches that reduce nocturnal physiological arousal (sleep‑focused relaxation, aerobic fitness where appropriate). Mood symptoms (CES‑D) are also a likely contributor to sleep complaints in this case and may merit attention in conjunction with sleep‑focused strategies."
89710,"The profile contains multiple converging indicators that point toward relatively poorer sleep quality. Psychologically, the participant reports a high burden of depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 39, Z = 2.67) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = 1.35); within this sample these measures have the largest positive correlations with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49 and 0.40), so they constitute strong predictors of higher (worse) self‑reported sleep disturbance. Low self‑esteem (RSES = 25, Z = −1.85; r ≈ −0.35 with PSQI), low current happiness (Z = −1.61), and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ −1.7) are additional psychosocial factors that, in this cohort, are associated with poorer sleep. Behavioral self‑reports show high daily Internet and music use (Z = 2.19 and 2.06) and late median sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:25), together with above‑average variability in sleep start time (SD ≈ 133 min, Z = 1.09). Late and irregular bedtimes plus extensive evening/late‑night screen/media exposure are well‑established contributors to worse sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality and are supported here by modest positive correlations with PSQI (sleep start variability r ≈ 0.17; some media measures r ≈ 0.1). Taken together, the combination of marked mood symptoms, late and inconsistent sleep timing, and high evening media use are salient risk factors for an elevated PSQI score.

Wearable‑derived circadian and heart‑rate metrics provide additional evidence consistent with decreased sleep quality and circadian organization. Non‑parametric and cosinor features indicate relatively weak day‑to‑day regularity and damped amplitude: interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = −1.56) and amplitude is reduced (7.57, Z = −1.04), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is also below average (Z ≈ −0.95). These features reflect blunted and less stable 24‑hour structure of heart‑rate rhythms across the recording period, which is commonly associated with fragmented or misaligned sleep. The hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show pronounced declines overnight (large negative deviations between ~2:00–6:00 AM) and elevated deviations in the late afternoon/early evening (notably a strong positive deviation around 5–6 PM). This pattern is compatible with a consolidated nocturnal sleep episode but with a circadian amplitude that is lower than peers and with activity/arousal consolidated later in the day — a profile that can exacerbate difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep when paired with a late habitual bedtime.

There are, however, several aspects of the data that mitigate against an extreme sleep deficit and provide partial protection. Median nightly sleep duration (≈ 6 h 44 min, Z = −0.56) is only modestly below the study mean and sleep quantity is not highly unstable overall (sleep duration SD ≈ 102 minutes, Z ≈ 0.04). Mean daily napping is rare (0.1 naps/day), which reduces the likelihood that daytime sleep is substantially fragmenting nocturnal sleep. Substance use is low (no beer, no recreational/non‑prescribed drugs; wine 1–2×/week), which is a favorable behavioral context for sleep. Resting heart rate and mesor are near the cohort average, and intradaily variability is not elevated (intradaily variability Z ≈ 0.03), suggesting the participant does not show extreme within‑day fragmentation of activity as captured by heart rate signals. Social exercise frequency (exercising with others 1–2×/week) and some engagement in recreational activities provide behavioral supports that could be leveraged to improve sleep timing and quality.

Integrative conclusion and comparison to the study sample mean: weighing the evidence, psychosocial risk factors (notably the very high depressive symptom score and elevated trait anxiety), late and irregular sleep timing, and blunted circadian amplitude together point toward worse subjective sleep quality than typical for this sample. Although sleep duration is only moderately below average and several behavioral protections (low substance use, infrequent naps) are present, the magnitude of mood symptoms and timing irregularity suggest the participant’s PSQI score is likely above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.71). In plain terms: the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with moderately poorer sleep quality relative to peers in this cohort, with depressive symptoms and circadian/behavioral irregularity the primary contributors; targeted attention to sleep timing regularity, evening media use, and mood symptoms would be the most direct targets to reduce PSQI‑related risk."
97596,"Summary of multimodal patterns
The participant’s profile presents a mixed picture: objective, wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics generally indicate adequate and relatively regular nocturnal sleep opportunity, while self-report psychological measures identify substantial affective distress that is strongly associated with poorer PSQI scores in the study sample. Key objective strengths are a long median sleep duration (8 h 10 min; Z = +1.22), low nap frequency (mean daily naps 0.07), a clear nocturnal heart-rate decline (large negative deviations from mesor through the 12:00–06:00 window) and a mesor/amplitude structure consistent with a consolidated day–night rhythm (mesor 77.8 bpm, amplitude 10.9). Key liabilities are high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33, Z = +2.05), elevated perceived stress (PSS = 32, Z = +2.83) and above-average trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = +0.56), each of which correlates positively with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40, PSS r ≈ 0.17).

Features likely to contribute to a higher PSQI (worse sleep quality)
Psychological symptom burden is the most salient source of risk for poorer subjective sleep in this participant. Depressive symptom severity is markedly elevated (CES-D Z = +2.05) and has the strongest sample-level correlation with PSQI (≈0.49), indicating that mood-related sleep complaints, sleep disturbances, or daytime dysfunction could be prominent despite objectively long sleep. Trait anxiety (STAI) and perceived stress are also elevated and have positive correlations with PSQI in the sample; such persistent worry or stress-related arousal commonly increases sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings, and subjective dissatisfaction. Physiologically, intradaily variability (IV = 0.66; Z = +0.81) is above average, which can reflect more fragmented activity/rest transitions and has been linked to degraded sleep quality even when total sleep time is preserved. Resting heart rate is slightly elevated (63.6 bpm; Z = +0.65) and has a small positive correlation with PSQI, consistent with higher physiological arousal. Minor variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 90 min; Z ≈ +0.15) together with listening-to-music behavior (reported >4 hours/day, Z = +2.06) may indicate evening behaviors or arousal that could interfere with subjective sleep quality for some individuals.

Features likely to contribute to a lower PSQI (better sleep quality)
Several objective and lifestyle indicators argue for relatively good sleep opportunity and sleep continuity. Median nightly sleep time is longer than the sample mean (8 h 10 min; Z = +1.22) and sleep-duration variability is lower than average (SD 60 min; Z = −0.92), suggesting consistent total sleep amounts across nights—both favorable for sleep quality. Wearable heart-rate patterns show clear nocturnal dipping (large negative deviations from mesor between midnight and early morning), which is typically a marker of consolidated sleep and lower nocturnal physiological activation. The participant reports little or no use of alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs and a relatively high frequency of exercise (exercised alone three or more times per week; Z ≈ +1.07), both behaviors that are associated with improved sleep in many samples. Interdaily stability is near the study mean (0.39; Z = −0.16), indicating a reasonably regular sleep–wake schedule day-to-day, and mean daily naps are minimal—both features that reduce the likelihood of pronounced circadian misalignment.

Circadian and physiological interpretation
Heart-rate cosinor metrics (mesor and amplitude) and the acrophase (≈4:14 PM) indicate a typical daytime peak and nocturnal trough in cardiovascular activity. The magnitude of nocturnal heart-rate reductions (e.g., −10 to −18 bpm across the night) is consistent with effective physiological downregulation during sleep. Interdaily stability close to the sample mean suggests the participant maintains a relatively consistent 24-hour pattern, while an elevated intradaily variability suggests some within-day fragmentation of activity/rest transitions (more abrupt or frequent switches between activity and rest), which can degrade sleep continuity for vulnerable individuals. Overall, the circadian heart-rate pattern supports intact nocturnal physiology, but IV and slightly elevated resting HR point to modest physiological arousal and fragmentation.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI
Balancing objective and subjective information, the participant shows objective signatures of adequate sleep opportunity and nocturnal physiological downregulation, but also substantial affective and stress-related burden that in this sample is strongly associated with worse PSQI scores. Given the high CES‑D (Z = +2.05), elevated STAI and PSS, and the sample-level correlations between these measures and PSQI (particularly CES‑D and STAI), the overall pattern is most consistent with a PSQI above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.7). In other words, despite objectively long and reasonably regular sleep duration, the participant’s psychological distress and modest markers of physiological arousal/fragmentation suggest their subjective sleep quality and functional sleep-related complaints are likely worse than average in this cohort.

Caveats
This synthesis integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable summaries. Objective indicators (duration, nocturnal HR dip) reduce the likelihood of severe objective sleep insufficiency, but they do not fully capture sleep latency, micro-awakenings, or subjective sleep quality components that drive PSQI scores. The strongest predictors of a higher PSQI here are the large, concurrent affective symptom burdens; these relationships reflect population-level associations and cannot establish causality for this individual."
57359,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of objective physiological regularity and behavioral patterns that both support and undermine sleep quality. Wearable-recorded sleep duration is relatively long (median 8 hr 8 min; Z = +1.18), resting heart rate is low (52.3 bpm; Z = −0.70), and non-clinical scores on depression and trait anxiety (CES-D = 11, STAI = 39; both slightly below sample means) indicate a generally low burden of affective symptoms that commonly degrade sleep. At the same time, features that often accompany poorer sleep—late sleep timing (median sleep start ~00:05), measurable day-to-day variability in sleep duration (SD = 108 min), and a modestly elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps = 0.18; Z = +1.27)—are present. Taken together, the pattern suggests overall sleep that is broadly adequate in duration and supported by favorable cardio-autonomic indices, but with behavioral timing irregularities and some fragmentation of circadian organization that could increase subjective or domain-specific sleep difficulties.

Features likely to increase PSQI (suggesting poorer sleep): Several behavioral and circadian indicators point toward factors that typically raise global PSQI scores. The participant’s median sleep onset is around midnight (00:05), which may contribute to greater sleep latency or misalignment with daytime demands. Sleep duration shows substantial night-to-night variability (SD 108 minutes; Z = +0.16) and a non-trivial nap rate (Z = +1.27); both greater variability and napping are correlated modestly with higher PSQI in the sample and can degrade perceived sleep continuity and daytime functioning. Circadian rhythmicity metrics show a low autocorrelation at 24 hours (value 0.20; Z = −1.03), which suggests weaker day-to-day repetition of heart-rate patterns and can reflect irregular schedules; weaker 24-h structure has been associated with worse sleep outcomes. Alcohol consumption at a frequency of 1–2 times per week (beer and wine/liquor; Z ≈ +1.0) is another behavioral factor that, even at moderate frequency, can fragment sleep or reduce sleep quality for some individuals. Although intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (IV = 0.51; Z = −0.25), the combination of late timing, naps, and reduced 24-h regularity represent credible contributors to higher PSQI components (latency, disturbances, daytime dysfunction).

Features likely to decrease PSQI (suggesting better sleep): Several objective and self-report indicators favor relatively good sleep quality. The participant’s long median sleep duration (≈8 h) is above the sample mean and would typically reduce the PSQI duration component and daytime sleepiness. Resting heart rate is low (52.3 bpm; Z = −0.70), and the nocturnal heart-rate profile shows substantial declines from the mesor overnight (e.g., −17 to −23 bpm across 2–7 AM), consistent with robust nocturnal autonomic downregulation and consolidated sleep physiology. Non-parametric circadian measures are not markedly disturbed: interdaily stability is near the sample average (0.43; Z = +0.17) and intradaily variability is modest (IV Z = −0.25), suggesting relatively low fragmentation within days. Self-report measures that often co-vary with poor sleep—depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and perceived stress—are at or below the sample mean (CES-D Z = −0.24; STAI Z = −0.23; Stress Z = −0.71), which is likely to support better subjective sleep quality and reduce the affective contributions to PSQI elevations. Academic performance (high GPA) and relatively high self-esteem further point toward psychosocial resources that are commonly associated with healthier sleep.

Physiological circadian picture and temporal activation: Cosinor-derived measures show a modest amplitude (11.5; Z = +0.24) and a mesor slightly below the sample mean (70.97; Z = −0.41). The acrophase near mid-late afternoon (≈16:00) and pronounced morning and evening positive deviations in aggregate heart rate (notably 8–9 AM and 7–9 PM elevations) indicate predictable daytime activity peaks and a clear overnight trough. The large overnight heart-rate drop is physiologically consistent with consolidated sleep episodes. However, the low 24-hour autocorrelation suggests the timing of these daily patterns is less consistent from day to day, which can undermine the stabilizing benefit of circadian timing for subjective sleep quality even when within-night physiology appears intact.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study sample: Balancing the objective strengths (long nightly sleep, robust nocturnal cardiac downregulation, low resting heart rate, low affective symptom burden) against the behavioral and circadian weaknesses (late sleep timing, elevated nap frequency, night-to-night duration variability, low 24-h autocorrelation), the overall profile is most consistent with sleep quality that is near to somewhat better than the average participant in this sample. In relation to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal indicators suggest an overall sleep quality that is likely at or slightly below the population mean PSQI (i.e., a similar or marginally better sleep quality than the typical participant), rather than substantially worse. This inference recognizes that objective restorative physiology and low mood/anxiety are protective, but that timing irregularities and napping produce risk for specific PSQI components (latency, disturbances, or daytime dysfunction) that could elevate the global score in some contexts.

Notes and caveats: This interpretation integrates cross-sectional correlations and summary-level wearable features rather than a direct PSQI score for the individual. Correlations provided in the dataset are helpful guides but do not substitute for the participant’s actual PSQI. Also, some wearable metrics (e.g., amplitude, acrophase) reflect heart-rate rhythms that may not capture sleep microstructure or subjective sleep complaints; conversely, self-reported habits (naps, alcohol use, evening activity) can influence subjective sleep quality beyond what heart-rate metrics detect. If a more precise estimate of the participant’s PSQI is required, direct PSQI responses or repeated subject-level symptom reports would improve specificity."
17308,"Summary of multimodal findings: The participant shows a mixed profile across self-report, wearable-derived circadian physiology, and sleep behavior. Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 27 minutes (Z = 0.33) with low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 64 minutes; Z = -0.84) and very consistent sleep onset times (median start ~01:18, start-time SD = 36 minutes; Z = -1.02). Wearable heart-rate circadian measures indicate a relatively low MESOR (60.85 bpm, Z = -1.79) and a low resting heart rate (47.2 bpm, Z = -1.30), a clear nocturnal decline in hourly heart rate (roughly -18 to -23 bpm relative to mesor during the 1–7 AM window), and a modest amplitude (11.26 bpm, Z = 0.15). Self-report measures show modest elevations in perceived stress (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92) and trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) while depressive symptom burden is near the sample average (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14). Lifestyle factors include regular exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.07), minimal napping (0 daily naps, Z = -0.86), and moderate alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0).

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several psychosocial and behavioral features tend to associate with worse subjective sleep in this sample. The participant reports elevated perceived stress (PSS Z = 0.92) and above-average trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.17); both scales correlate positively with PSQI in the study (CES-D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40; PSS r ~ 0.20), suggesting these symptoms could increase subjective sleep complaints. The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:18 AM), and later or evening-focused sleep schedules are often linked with poorer subjective sleep quality even when duration is adequate; sleep start variability shows a small positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.18). Moderate weekly alcohol use (1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0) is another behavioral factor that can degrade perceived sleep quality for some individuals.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Objective wearable and behavioral indicators provide several protective signals. Total sleep duration is sufficient by conventional standards (median 7 h 27 min; Z = 0.33) with low variability across nights (sleep-duration SD Z = -0.84) and minimal daytime napping (Z = -0.86), all of which tend to support consolidated and restorative sleep. The heart-rate profile shows a robust nocturnal decline relative to daytime mesor (nighttime hourly deviations ~ -18 to -23 bpm) and a low resting heart rate (47.2 bpm, Z = -1.30), patterns that are compatible with sustained, relatively deep sleep physiology and good cardiovascular fitness. Regular exercise (reported ≥3×/week; Z = 1.07), which correlates weakly in the sample with better sleep (r ≈ -0.08), also supports sleep health. Circadian rhythm metrics are mixed but not strongly disruptive: interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.37, Z = -0.33) while intradaily variability is near average (0.54, Z = -0.04), suggesting only modest day-to-day rhythm irregularity rather than pronounced circadian fragmentation.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the signals, the participant exhibits objective sleep that is regular and of adequate duration with physiological markers consistent with consolidated nocturnal sleep, which weigh toward lower (better) PSQI. Conversely, moderately elevated perceived stress, some trait anxiety, a late habitual sleep timing, and moderate alcohol use are factors that tend to increase subjective sleep complaints and therefore could push PSQI upward. Taken together, these opposing influences suggest that the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely close to the study sample average rather than extreme in either direction. In other words, the inferred PSQI level is near the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73), with a small tendency—driven primarily by elevated stress/anxiety and late sleep timing—toward a slightly higher (worse) PSQI than the sample mean, but not markedly so.

Points for further consideration: Because subjective sleep quality and PSQI scores often reflect perceived sleep (which is sensitive to stress, mood, and timing) as much as objective duration, follow-up self-report on sleep satisfaction, nocturnal awakenings, and sleep latency would clarify whether the psychosocial risk factors are translating into poorer perceived sleep. Additionally, if improving subjective sleep is a goal, interventions that target stress reduction, earlier sleep timing, and moderation of evening alcohol could be prioritized given the mixed profile here."
51851,"Evidence suggesting factors that would contribute to a relatively high PSQI (worse sleep quality): the participant’s sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep-start ~00:56, sleep-start SD = 111 minutes, Z = 0.61), which is a known behavioral risk for sleep disturbance and is reflected here by relatively high intradaily variability in the wearable-derived circadian measures (intradaily variability = 0.72, Z = 1.23). Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.32, Z = -0.74), indicating day-to-day inconsistency in the heart-rate circadian pattern and further supporting an irregular rest–activity rhythm. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is moderate (SD = 86 minutes, Z = -0.34) and median sleep duration is just under 7 hours (6 h 57 m, Z = -0.28), placing the participant near the short-sleep range; this degree of variability and timing irregularity are features that typically increase PSQI scores. In addition, modest alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0) and a modest positive association between depressive symptoms and PSQI in the cohort (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49) are additional factors that can be expected to worsen subjective sleep quality. Together, these behavioral and circadian irregularities point toward sources of fragmented or lower-quality sleep despite not being extreme in any single metric.

Evidence suggesting factors that would contribute to a relatively low PSQI (better sleep quality): the wearable physiology indicates strong nocturnal cardiovascular down-regulation — hourly mean heart rate deviations are markedly negative across the night (e.g., 2–3am: -20.45 bpm; 6–7am: -25.76 bpm) relative to the mesor, and the participant’s resting heart rate is very low (41.1 bpm, Z = -2.03) with a low mesor (60.05 bpm, Z = -1.90). These features are consistent with robust nocturnal autonomic quiescence and generally 'deep' physiological sleep. The participant reports low daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.07, Z = -0.08), frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others, and sports three times/week or more; Zs ≈ 1.07–1.58), high health satisfaction (Z = 1.63), and relatively high self-esteem (Z = 1.10) — all factors that tend to protect sleep quality and are associated in this sample with lower PSQI scores (exercise correlations with PSQI are modestly negative). Anxiety scores are low (STAI trait = 35, Z = -0.62) and perceived stress is not elevated (PSS = 20, Z = -0.44), which also point toward fewer subjective sleep complaints.

Interpretation of circadian and hourly heart-rate patterns: the cosinor-derived acrophase (~4:57 PM) and daytime positive heart-rate deviations (peaking in late afternoon/evening) indicate a physiological activity peak later in the day, while substantial negative deviations across the overnight hours reflect a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate trough. The participant’s amplitude is moderate (9.89, Z = -0.29), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.28, Z = -0.36), consistent with a circadian rhythm that is present but not strongly stable across days. Practically, this pattern suggests the participant achieves distinct physiologic separation between awake and sleep states on average (clear nocturnal heart-rate decline), but the timing of sleep and day-to-day regularity are inconsistent (high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability), which increases the likelihood of subjective sleep fragmentation or daytime impairment even when physiological sleep depth is preserved on many nights.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: the data present a mixed profile — physiological indicators (very low resting heart rate, pronounced nocturnal HR decline, low napping, frequent exercise) argue for relatively good objective sleep physiology, while behavioral timing instability (late, variable bedtimes), elevated intradaily variability, and modest alcohol use and depressive symptom burden argue toward poorer subjective sleep. Considering the balance of evidence and the magnitude of the circadian irregularities, the participant’s overall sleep quality is best characterized as near the study sample mean PSQI (population mean PSQI = 6.72). In other words, the participant does not consistently appear to be substantially better or worse than the typical study participant; instead, strengths in physiological sleep markers and lifestyle (exercise, low napping) likely mitigate the adverse effects of irregular timing and variability, resulting in an overall sleep profile close to the cohort average."
77872,"Summary of wearable-derived sleep and circadian patterns: The participant’s wearable data indicate a consistently late sleep schedule (median sleep start ~01:58 AM) with a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 50 minutes (Z = -0.44 relative to the study sample). Sleep timing variability is modest (sleep start SD ≈ 82 minutes, near the sample mean) and the participant reports essentially no daytime napping. Circadian analyses of heart rate show a relatively robust amplitude (amplitude = 13.11, Z = 0.75) with a mesor of 78.7 (Z = 0.65) and an acrophase in the early evening (~5:58 PM). Non‑parametric rhythm metrics indicate intact day‑to‑day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.40, near the sample mean) and unusually low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.36, Z = -1.31). Hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced evening and late‑night elevations (notably 11–12 AM and 12–1 AM with Z ≈ 1.8 and 1.6, respectively) and expected nocturnal reductions in the early morning hours.

Factors suggesting comparatively poorer sleep quality (likely to raise PSQI): Multiple features point toward risk for higher PSQI (worse sleep). The participant’s habitual bedtime near 02:00 AM and a median sleep duration under 7 hours are both established contributors to poorer subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction; these are present here (median start 01:58, median duration 6:50). Elevated evening/late‑night heart‑rate deviations (large positive deviations around 11 PM–1 AM) are consistent with physiological arousal near bedtime and could reflect delayed wind‑down or autonomic activation that impairs sleep initiation or subjective sleep quality. Weekly alcohol consumption (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) can also fragment sleep or reduce sleep quality for some individuals. Taken together, late timing, slightly short duration, and signs of evening physiological activation are the most salient signals that would push PSQI upward.

Factors suggesting comparatively better sleep quality (likely to lower PSQI): Several objective and self‑report indicators argue for relatively preserved sleep quality. The low intradaily variability (Z = -1.31) suggests limited within‑day fragmentation of activity and heart rate, which is typically associated with consolidated nighttime sleep. The participant reports no daytime naps and shows modest night‑to‑night variability in duration (sleep duration SD = 64 minutes, Z = -0.84), both of which reduce the likelihood of daytime sleepiness and fragmented sleep patterns. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.8 bpm) and non‑clinical psychological symptom scores (CES‑D = 11, STAI trait = 33) are in the non‑clinical range, which is relevant because higher depressive or anxiety symptoms in this sample correlate with worse PSQI; here those symptom levels would be expected to favor better subjective sleep. High self‑reported health satisfaction and above‑average self‑esteem also align with factors that tend to reduce PSQI scores.

Holistic assessment and comparison to sample mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows a mixture of risk and protective features. The strongest negative signals are behavioral (habitually late sleep timing and slightly short total sleep time) and physiological (elevated evening heart rate), whereas the strongest protective signals are objective consolidation of circadian rhythm (low intradaily variability, limited napping), low psychological symptomatology, and reasonable health satisfaction. On balance, these data suggest the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely modestly worse than the study sample average. Framing this relative to the study PSQI distribution (population mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the available multimodal evidence supports an inference that the participant’s PSQI would fall above the population mean (i.e., indicating somewhat poorer sleep quality than average), rather than substantially better. This conclusion principally reflects the late sleep timing and signs of pre‑sleep physiological arousal despite otherwise consolidated rhythms and low symptom burden.

Interpretive caveats: This synthesis integrates cross‑sectional wearable aggregates and single‑time self‑report scores; it does not substitute for a direct PSQI score nor clinical assessment. Hourly heart‑rate deviations are aggregated across days and cannot identify day‑specific events; causality among alcohol, timing, arousal and subjective sleep is not established here. If sleep quality is a concern, interventions targeting earlier sleep timing and evening arousal reduction (behavioral sleep scheduling, limiting evening alcohol/caffeine, pre‑bed relaxation) would be the most directly indicated next steps based on the pattern observed."
72348,"Summary of features consistent with relatively good sleep quality: Objective wearable-derived sleep metrics point toward consolidated and regular nocturnal sleep. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 8 hours 22 minutes (Z = +1.48), with a low night-to-night duration standard deviation of 39 minutes (Z = −1.40) and a tightly clustered sleep start time (median ≈ 23:45; start-time SD 26 minutes, Z = −1.24). Napping was effectively absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = −0.86). Circadian/heart-rate rhythm measures further support a well-entrained schedule: high interdaily stability (0.65, Z = +1.99) and high autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.62, Z = +2.49) indicate strong day-to-day regularity, while intradaily variability is relatively low (0.43, Z = −0.81), suggesting limited within-day fragmentation. Several of these markers (interdaily stability, regular sleep timing, low variability) are associated in the study with lower PSQI scores (i.e., better sleep), and the magnitudes here are notable.

Features that could contribute to relatively poorer sleep quality: Physiological signals show some elevation in basal cardiovascular tone: resting heart rate is 71.2 bpm (Z = +1.55) and the cosinor MESOR is elevated (86.31, Z = +1.69). In this sample these cardiac elevations have small positive correlations with PSQI (resting HR r ≈ 0.12), which is consistent with modestly greater reported sleep disturbance in people with higher resting heart rate. Behavioral habits that may negatively influence sleep include low frequency of exercise (exercise mostly 1–2 times a month or less; Z-scores negative) and above-average evening/total sedentary screen time (internet use 3–4 hours, Z = +1.52; watching TV/video 1–2 hours, Z = +1.28; sedentary hobby time Z = +1.41). These activity patterns show small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample, suggesting they could modestly increase risk of worse subjective sleep. Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 22, Z ≈ +0.10) which in the cohort is weakly associated with higher PSQI.

Psychological and contextual balance: Self-report symptom measures are generally not indicative of high affective burden—CES‑D = 6 (Z ≈ −0.76) and STAI‑Trait = 39 (Z ≈ −0.23), both below or near the study mean and classified here as not depressed / not anxious. Self-rated health satisfaction is above average (Z ≈ +0.47) and substance use is essentially absent; both of these characteristics are linked in the cohort to lower PSQI. Taken together, the psychological profile and low substance use support better subjective sleep, whereas sedentary lifestyle and moderately elevated stress and resting HR are countervailing factors.

Physiological circadian pattern interpretation: Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show large overnight drops relative to mesor (nighttime nadirs ~ −14 to −17 bpm between midnight and 6 AM) and daytime elevations peaking in the morning (e.g., +16.6 bpm at 9–10 AM), with an acrophase around mid‑afternoon (≈ 3:25 PM). These patterns are consistent with a robust circadian amplitude and a typical nocturnal dip, aligning with the high interdaily stability and low intradaily variability. Cosinor amplitude is near the study mean (amplitude = 11.49, Z ≈ +0.23), so the rhythm is present and regular even if MESOR is somewhat elevated.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Weighing the evidence, the balance of objective and self-report indicators favors relatively good sleep quality for this participant. Strong indicators include long median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, a consistent bedtime, absence of naps, and highly regular circadian heart-rate rhythms—factors that in this sample are associated with lower PSQI scores. Countervailing indicators (elevated resting heart rate/mesor, low exercise, and elevated sedentary/screen time) could modestly increase subjective sleep complaints but are smaller in magnitude. On balance, the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely below the population mean PSQI (i.e., better than average sleep quality compared to the study sample mean PSQI = 6.72). This conclusion is probabilistic: several correlational effects are small in magnitude, so individual subjective sleep complaints could still differ from this overall inference."
89607,"Objective wearable data indicate a mixed profile of sleep quantity and circadian regularity. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 hours 12 minutes; Z = +1.26) with low night-to-night variability in both duration (SD = 65 minutes; Z = -0.81) and sleep start time (median start 02:02:30; start-time SD Z = -0.90). Non-parametric circadian features support this regularity: high interdaily stability (0.56; Z = +1.24) and relatively low intradaily variability (0.45; Z = -0.67) indicate a consistent day-to-day pattern with limited fragmentation. Mean hourly heart rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal dip (largest reductions across the 2–7 a.m. window) and clear daytime peaks (largest positive deviations in early afternoon), consistent with an intact 24-hour rhythm. At the same time, cosinor-derived metrics show an elevated mesor (80.34; Z = +0.87) and reduced amplitude (9.67; Z = -0.36), and resting heart rate is higher than the study average (68.6 bpm; Z = +1.24). This constellation suggests a generally regular but relatively late-timed sleep schedule with somewhat elevated baseline cardiovascular tone and blunted circadian amplitude.

Psychological, behavioral and contextual data contain signals that both support and threaten sleep quality. Indicators that are commonly associated with poorer sleep include elevated depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 24; Z = +1.11) and higher trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = +0.76). In this study these symptom measures also show moderate positive correlations with PSQI (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), meaning higher scores on these scales are associated with worse subjective sleep in the sample. Additional factors potentially linked to worse sleep are the late median sleep onset (≈02:00), a modestly elevated resting heart rate and mesor (possible markers of greater physiological arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness), and a greater-than-average frequency of short naps (mean daily naps = 0.18; Z = +1.27), which can reflect residual daytime sleepiness or partial compensation for nocturnal disturbance. Behavioral context such as relatively high time spent playing video games (Z = +1.71) may also contribute to later bedtimes.

Conversely, several features point toward preserved or better-than-average sleep continuity and recovery. The participant’s objectively long median sleep duration (Z = +1.26) and low variability in both sleep timing and duration indicate reliable opportunity for sleep and consolidated nocturnal sleep on most recorded nights. High frequencies of exercise and social/exercise engagement (exercise-related Z-scores > +1) are behaviors typically associated with better sleep quality, and the participant reports relatively low perceived stress (PSS Z ≈ -0.44) and reasonable health satisfaction. Non-use of most recreational and non-prescribed substances and moderate alcohol use (wine 1–2×/week) are additional behaviors that tend to protect sleep.

Balancing these lines of evidence, the most salient risk factors for elevated PSQI (worse sleep) are the participant’s elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both moderately correlated with PSQI in this sample), the late sleep timing (persistent ~02:00 bedtime), and markers of elevated baseline physiological arousal (higher resting HR and mesor, blunted HR amplitude). The most salient protective factors are the objectively long and consistent nightly sleep, high day-to-day circadian stability, frequent exercise, and low fragmentation. Several objective wearable metrics that might be expected to reflect poor sleep (e.g., intradaily variability) are actually favorable here, whereas subjective symptom measures align with worse sleep; correlations between many wearable metrics and PSQI are small, adding uncertainty.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSQI (mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16): on balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a sleep quality level slightly worse than the study mean (i.e., a PSQI likely a bit above 6.72). This inference rests primarily on the moderately elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (stronger PSQI correlates in the sample) and signs of elevated physiological arousal and late timing, which likely offset the objective advantages of long, regular sleep opportunity. Uncertainty remains because several objective circadian and sleep-consistency indicators are favorable and many wearable–PSQI correlations are small; thus the conclusion is that sleep quality is probably somewhat worse than average in this sample, but not decisively so."
59900,"Protective features consistent with relatively good sleep quality are prominent in the data. Objectively, the participant’s median nightly sleep duration is long (9 hours 22 minutes; Z = +2.71), and wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations from the mesor overnight, e.g., ~–12 to –15 bpm in the 4–7 AM window), which is a physiological pattern consistent with consolidated sleep and intact nocturnal autonomic down-regulation. Resting heart rate is modest (59.1 bpm, Z = +0.11) and the participant reports low-to-moderate levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 13, Z = –0.03; STAI = 37, Z = –0.43) and lower perceived stress (PSS = 19, Z = –0.71). These psychological indicators, together with the long median sleep duration and absence of reported daily naps, argue for reasonably restorative sleep opportunity and limited symptom burden that is known to accompany poorer sleep.

Conversely, several features point toward factors that tend to increase the likelihood of poorer sleep quality. Sleep timing and regularity are notable: median sleep start is shortly after midnight (00:10) with high night-to-night variability (sleep start SD = 137 minutes, Z = +1.19) and sleep duration is highly variable across days (SD = 169 minutes, Z = +1.55). These measures of irregularity are positively correlated with PSQI in the sample (sleep-duration SD r ≈ 0.18; sleep-start SD r ≈ 0.16) and are commonly associated with worse subjective sleep quality. Circadian-summary metrics indicate reduced regularity and a blunted rhythm relative to the study population (interdaily stability = 0.32, Z = –0.74; amplitude = 8.27, Z = –0.81; 24-hour autocorrelation = 0.17, Z = –1.29), which together suggest a weaker, less consistent daily cardiovascular rhythm—another feature that can relate to sleep complaints. Lifestyle markers that can negatively affect sleep (minimal regular exercise: “not at all,” Z ≈ –1.9) and frequent alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ +1.0) further represent potential contributors to poorer sleep continuity or sleep quality.

The circadian and physiological profile is mixed but interpretable: heart-rate cosinor results show a measurable daytime acrophase (around 4:37 PM) and a pronounced overnight dip in aggregate hourly heart rate, indicating preserved day–night modulation of autonomic activity despite lower amplitude and diminished day-to-day stability. Intradaily variability (0.38, Z = –1.16) is lower than the study mean, which in isolation can reflect fewer abrupt transitions in activity/physiology within days (often favorable); however, the concurrent low interdaily stability and low 24 h autocorrelation indicate that while individual days may be relatively smooth, the timing of those days varies across the recording period. In sum, the physiology supports real nocturnal rest but also points to an irregular schedule and a relatively damped circadian amplitude.

Weighing the evidence, the strongest positive signal is the long median sleep duration and clear nocturnal physiological trough; the strongest negative signals are the elevated night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration, reduced circadian stability, minimal exercise, and some alcohol use. Taken together, these patterns suggest overall sleep quality that is close to the study sample average, with offsetting factors producing a mixed profile: some indicators suggest better-than-average sleep (long sleep time, low symptom burden) while others predict worse subjective sleep (irregular schedule, blunted circadian regularity). Compared to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.7 (SD = 2.13), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with a PSQI near the population mean or modestly below it (i.e., similar to or slightly better than the sample average), rather than clearly above the mean. 

Limitations: no direct PSQI score for this participant was provided, and inference is therefore indirect; associations reported above use sample correlations and should be interpreted as explanatory rather than determinative."
28254,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of protective psychosocial characteristics and physiological/circadian features that raise concern for sleep disruption. Psychologically, the participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 32, Z = -0.92), reasonable self-esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and relatively low perceived stress (PSS = 19, Z = -0.71). Behaviorally, they report no daily naps, limited recreational drug use, modest weekly alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2x/week, Z ≈ 1.0), and modest exercise frequency. Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate a median sleep duration of 6 h 45 min (Z = -0.53) with low night-to-night duration variability (SD = 45 min, Z = -1.26) but a late median sleep start time (00:50) and comparatively large sleep-start variability (SD = 122 min, Z = 0.86). Circadian features from heart rate show reduced interdaily stability (0.28, Z = -1.07), lower amplitude (8.37, Z = -0.78), and a modestly elevated resting heart rate (61.9 bpm, Z = 0.45).

Evidence consistent with higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): Several physiological and behavioral signals point toward factors that typically relate to worse sleep. The participant’s median sleep onset is late (≈00:50) and sleep-start times are relatively variable (SD 122 min, Z = 0.86), both of which commonly correspond with worse subjective sleep quality. Circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (Z = -1.07) and blunted amplitude (Z = -0.78), indicating a less robust 24-hour heart-rate rhythm; such features are often associated with poorer sleep consolidation and subjective complaints. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations suggest that, relative to the study sample, nocturnal heart rate is less suppressed during parts of the night (several nighttime hours show positive Z-scores for deviation from the mesor), which can reflect elevated nocturnal physiological arousal; these nocturnal HR deviations have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (e.g., correlations up to ~0.23 at 3–4 AM). Resting heart rate is slightly higher than the sample mean (Z = 0.45), a pattern that in this dataset correlates modestly with worse PSQI (r ≈ 0.12). The participant’s median sleep duration (6 h 45 min) is below 7 hours and below the study mean (Z = -0.53), which is another risk factor for higher PSQI scores.

Evidence consistent with lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Several psychosocial and behavioral indicators favor relatively good subjective sleep. Low scores on depression and trait anxiety (CES-D and STAI both well below sample means) are strongly associated with lower PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), and the participant’s low scores here suggest reduced risk for sleep complaints driven by mood or anxiety. The participant reports no daily naps (Z = -0.86), limited recreational drug use, a generally favorable health-satisfaction rating (5/7, Z = 0.55), and relatively consistent total sleep duration across nights (sleep duration SD Z = -1.26) — all features that tend to support better subjective sleep. Exercise and socializing levels are low-to-moderate but not extreme, and substance use correlations with PSQI in this sample are small, reducing the likelihood that these behaviors are strong drivers of poor sleep for this individual.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study sample mean PSQI: Balancing the two sets of evidence, the strongest signals toward poorer sleep come from physiological and circadian measurements (reduced interdaily stability and amplitude; relatively elevated nocturnal heart rate relative to peers; late and variable sleep onset), whereas the strongest signals toward better sleep are psychosocial (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, reasonable self-esteem and low perceived stress) and the absence of naps or heavy drug use. On net, the participant’s profile most consistently indicates a sleep state close to the study population average but leaning modestly toward poorer sleep. Therefore, relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72, the participant’s inferred overall sleep quality is best described as near the mean, with a slight tendency to be above the population mean (i.e., modestly worse sleep than the sample average). This conclusion reflects the combination of somewhat short and late sleep timing plus blunted/irregular circadian physiology despite generally favorable mood and low symptom burden.

Clinical/research notes (interpretive caution): The inference above integrates multiple small-to-moderate signals rather than a single definitive marker; many correlations with PSQI in the dataset are modest. Objective circadian and nocturnal HR features here may merit further monitoring (e.g., more consistent sleep timing, interventions to strengthen circadian regularity) if subjective sleep complaints are present, but the participant’s low mood/anxiety scores reduce the probability that psychological distress is the primary driver of poor sleep in this case."
35347,"Factors that point toward relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI score): the participant exhibits a markedly delayed sleep timing with a median sleep start near 02:12 AM, indicating chronic late-night sleep onset that can produce circadian misalignment. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (sleep duration SD = 146 minutes, Z = 1.04), and mean daily naps are relatively frequent (0.3 naps/day, Z = 2.66); both greater variability and more daytime napping are associated in the sample with worse PSQI (sample correlations with PSQI: SD of sleep duration r ≈ 0.20; naps r ≈ 0.18). Behavioral correlates that are plausibly related to disturbed sleep include very high Internet usage (more than 4 hours daily, Z = 2.19) and minimal regular exercise (exercising alone and with others both reported less than 1–2 times a month, Zs ≈ -1.18 and -0.88), habits that in this dataset trend weakly toward higher PSQI. Physiological indications of evening arousal are present in the aggregated heart-rate deviations (notably an elevated heart-rate deviation at 6–7 PM, +22.6 beats relative to mesor, Z = 1.75, and sustained elevated deviations across late evening hours), which may reflect heightened evening activity/arousal that can make sleep initiation later and less restorative. Taken together, the late median sleep onset, elevated intra-night variability, frequent naps, late-evening physiological arousal, low exercise, and high evening/late-night behaviors form a coherent set of risk factors for poorer subjective sleep quality.

Factors that point toward relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI score): the participant’s median nightly sleep duration is long (8 hours 29 minutes, Z = 1.61), which often corresponds to fewer complaints about insufficient sleep and is weakly associated with better PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.05, i.e., small effect). Trait and symptom measures that tend to relate to better sleep are generally favorable: low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, Z ≈ -0.34) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z ≈ -1.02) — notably, in this study depressive symptoms have one of the stronger positive correlations with PSQI (CES-D r ≈ 0.49), so the participant’s relatively low score on that scale is a protecting influence. Circadian rhythm summary metrics derived from heart rate also suggest reasonably structured rhythmicity: interdaily stability is slightly above the cohort mean (value = 0.45, Z = 0.33) and amplitude of the circadian fit is modestly elevated (amplitude = 12.72, Z = 0.63), both of which in the sample trend slightly toward better sleep (amplitude r ≈ -0.11; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.07). Resting heart rate is low-normal (57.8 bpm, Z = -0.04), consistent with generally good cardiovascular baseline. These elements (adequate total sleep time, low affective symptoms, and a reasonably stable circadian signal) are signals that could support relatively good subjective sleep.

Integrative interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: the profile contains a mixture of protective and risk features. The long median sleep duration, low depressive and anxiety symptoms, and modestly stable circadian rhythm argue in favor of better subjective sleep, while the chronically late sleep timing (median start ~02:12 AM), substantial night-to-night duration variability, frequent napping, low physical activity, and behavioral patterns consistent with extended evening/late-night wakefulness argue for impaired sleep continuity or sleep quality. Because several of the strongest sample correlates of PSQI (notably depressive symptoms) are low in this individual, but clear behavioral and timing risk factors for poor sleep are present and of appreciable magnitude (late timing Z not provided but offset by large positive Z for naps and for duration consistency), the overall evidence supports an inferred sleep quality that is modestly worse than typical for this sample. In summary: relative to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73, the participant’s pattern is more consistent with a PSQI score above the population mean (i.e., somewhat poorer sleep quality than the cohort average), driven primarily by late sleep timing, high intra-individual sleep variability, and compensatory daytime napping despite overall long nightly sleep time."
45641,"Summary of wearable sleep and circadian physiology: The participant’s objective sleep metrics show a median nightly duration of 7 hours 54 minutes (Z = 0.89), low nap frequency (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86), and relatively low night-to-night variability in sleep start time (SD = 50 minutes, Z = -0.73). Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a structured, robust 24-hour rhythm: high interdaily stability (0.58, Z = 1.41), relatively low intradaily variability (0.47, Z = -0.53), and above-average mesor and amplitude (MESOR = 80.02, Z = 0.83; amplitude = 13.3, Z = 0.81). Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected large nocturnal declines in heart rate (notably between ~2–7 AM) but also elevated cardiovascular activity during late evening hours (notable positive deviations at ~9–11 PM and a positive deviation at midnight; e.g., 9–10 PM deviation = 18.5, Z = 1.83; 12–1 AM deviation = 8.13, Z = 1.42), which is consistent with physiological arousal in the hours preceding the participant’s typical sleep start.

Psychological traits and lifestyle context: Self-report measures indicate elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 22, Z = 0.90, classified “Depressed” in the study’s scoring), moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46), and above-average perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38). The participant reports low exercise frequency (exercise Z-scores ≈ -1.0 to -1.2), high sedentary hobby time (Z = 2.01), and moderate evening/online engagement (internet use Z = 0.85). Substance use is minimal. Several of these psychological and behavioral measures have non-trivial positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49; STAI correlation = 0.40), indicating these features are associated with worse subjective sleep quality in this cohort.

Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality (factors that would increase PSQI): The strongest indicators pointing toward poorer sleep are the elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, which in this dataset show the largest positive correlations with PSQI (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40). Behavioral and physiological signs of evening arousal—late median sleep start near 02:00 AM and elevated evening heart-rate deviations (Zs up to ~1.8 between 9–11 PM and Z = 1.42 at midnight)—suggest difficulty winding down before sleep and circadian timing that favors a late sleep window; both are commonly linked to worse subjective sleep. Low exercise frequency and prolonged sedentary evening activities and internet use are additional lifestyle factors that, in the study correlations, trend toward higher PSQI (small positive correlations) and may maintain late-night arousal. Taken together, these psychological and evening-arousal indicators are likely to raise this participant’s PSQI score relative to peers.

Evidence consistent with better sleep quality (factors that would decrease PSQI): Several objective features point toward preserved or even favorable sleep structure: median sleep duration is near eight hours (Z = 0.89), nocturnal heart-rate declines in the deep-night hours are pronounced, sleep-start variability is lower-than-average, naps are absent, and circadian metrics show high interdaily stability and low intradaily fragmentation (Z = 1.41 and Z = -0.53, respectively). These markers—consistent sleep timing across days, consolidated circadian rhythm, adequate total sleep time, and low fragmentation—are typically associated with better subjective sleep quality and would, all else equal, predict a lower PSQI.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: The available evidence is mixed but coherent: robust regularity and sufficient sleep duration are protective, whereas elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms, late habitual bedtimes, and physiological and behavioral evening arousal are risk factors for worse subjective sleep. Given the relatively strong association between affective symptoms and PSQI in this sample (CES-D and STAI correlations) and the marked late-evening arousal pattern, the balance of risk versus protective factors suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely somewhat worse than average. Stated relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72, the participant’s inferred sleep quality would most plausibly be above the population mean (i.e., indicating more sleep-related complaints than the typical participant), though not necessarily at an extreme level because objective duration and circadian stability are relatively favorable."
64572,"Summary of key objective observations: Wearable-derived metrics indicate a participant with a relatively strong and regular circadian structure (interdaily stability = 0.61, Z = 1.66) and a low resting heart rate (50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Cosinor amplitude is modestly elevated (12.3, Z = 0.49) with an expected acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:57 PM). Nighttime aggregate heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM, up to -24.75 bpm), indicating clear physiological nighttime down-regulation. Wearable sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 38 minutes (Z = -0.69), a median sleep start time of 00:42, relatively low night-to-night variability in sleep start (SD = 55 minutes, Z = -0.61), and almost no naps.

Evidence suggesting relatively poorer sleep quality (factors that would push PSQI higher): The participant’s median sleep duration is below 7 hours (6 h 38 m), which is commonly associated with reduced sleep quality and daytime impairment and is reflected here by a moderate negative Z-score relative to the sample (Z = -0.69). Wearable-derived hourly heart-rate pattern shows pronounced elevations in the evening (especially 8–9 PM: +23.6 bpm, Z = 2.47; 7–10 PM elevated), which may indicate evening physiological arousal or activity that could delay sleep onset or reduce sleep consolidation for some individuals. Perceived stress is non-negligible (PSS = 22, Z ≈ 0.1), and night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD = 96 minutes) is substantial in absolute minutes even if near the cohort mean; greater variability has a modest positive correlation with worse PSQI in the sample (correlation ≈ 0.20). Together, shorter average sleep duration and relatively elevated evening arousal constitute the clearest objective and behavioral signals that could contribute to higher PSQI scores.

Evidence suggesting relatively better sleep quality (factors that would push PSQI lower): Several trait and behavioral indicators are favorable. Self-report measures show low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62), both of which are associated with better subjective sleep in many studies. Substance use is absent (no alcohol or recreational drug use), daily naps are essentially zero (Z = -0.86), and the participant reports regular sleep timing (median start ~00:42 with SD Z = -0.61). Objective circadian metrics indicate substantial interdaily stability and low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.53, Z = -0.11), which are generally associated with more consolidated sleep. Low resting heart rate and a clear nocturnal heart-rate trough further support intact sleep physiology. These protective factors—stable circadian rhythm, low mood/anxiety symptoms, minimal substance use, and absence of daytime napping—are more often associated with lower (better) PSQI scores.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows multiple strong protective features for sleep (high circadian regularity, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, minimal substance use, low resting heart rate, low napping) together with two notable concerns (median sleep duration below 7 hours and evening elevations in heart rate that could reflect late activity/arousal). Given the relative magnitudes (several strong Z-scores in the positive direction for circadian regularity and in the negative direction for resting heart rate and mood symptoms, versus a single moderately negative Z for sleep duration and marked evening HR deviations), the overall pattern is more consistent with sleep quality that is at or somewhat better than the cohort average. Stated relative to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the participant’s data are most consistent with a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., somewhat better-than-average sleep quality), though not uniformly optimal because of the shortened median sleep duration and evening arousal signals.

Uncertainty and caveats: Correlations between many individual wearable or survey features and PSQI in the sample are small, so any inference about the participant’s precise PSQI score is probabilistic. The short median sleep duration is the single strongest concrete indicator pushing toward worse subjective sleep; if that shorter sleep is experienced as nonrestorative or accompanied by daytime dysfunction (not measured here), the participant’s PSQI could be closer to the sample mean or higher. Conversely, the combination of regular timing, low mood/anxiety, and clear circadian physiology make a substantially worse PSQI less likely."
28312,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of indicators. Objective wearable measures show a relatively robust, high-amplitude circadian pattern with clear nocturnal heart-rate dipping and a median nightly sleep duration above 7.5 hours. In contrast, behavioral and self-report measures highlight a late habitual sleep onset (median start ~01:23 AM), substantial night-to-night variability in total sleep time (SD ≈ 123 minutes), and elevated trait anxiety. Taken together, the pattern suggests physiologically well-structured sleep opportunity but some behavioral and psychological factors that could degrade subjective or component-level sleep quality.

Features that would tend to increase PSQI (worse sleep quality): The participant reports a late median sleep onset (01:23 AM), which can be associated with circadian misalignment or social schedule conflicts and may affect subjective sleep satisfaction or daytime functioning. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is high (SD ~123 minutes; Z = 0.51), and higher variability correlates positively with PSQI in this sample (corr ≈ 0.20), indicating that inconsistent total sleep time is a likely contributor to poorer self-reported sleep. Trait anxiety (STAI = 48, Z ≈ 0.66) is elevated relative to the sample; STAI scores have a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (≈ 0.40), so chronic anxiety-proneness is a notable risk factor for higher PSQI here. Modest weekly alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week) and a resting mesor/mean heart rate that is above the sample mean (MESOR 83.4, Z ≈ 1.3; resting HR 61.7, Z ≈ 0.42) are additional, smaller contributors that may be associated with more disturbed sleep or greater sleep complaints (correlations with PSQI are small but positive).

Features that would tend to decrease PSQI (better sleep quality): Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics point toward a strong, regular physiological rhythm, which typically supports better sleep. The participant’s heart rate amplitude is relatively large (amplitude 15.54, Z ≈ 1.54), interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation are above average (interdaily stability = 0.45, Z ≈ 0.33; 24-h autocorrelation = 0.43, Z ≈ 0.9), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows pronounced nocturnal dips (strong negative deviations between ~2–6 AM, down to ≈ -23 bpm), all consistent with consolidated biological night and night-time quiescence. These circadian strengths are associated in the sample with lower PSQI (amplitude and stability have small negative correlations with PSQI). Median sleep duration (7 h 35 min; Z ≈ 0.51) is longer than the study mean and generally protective for sleep quality. The participant also reports low frequency of naps (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08) and relatively consistent sleep-start timing (start-time SD ≈ 58 min, Z ≈ -0.54), which reduce fragmentation and irregularity that can worsen subjective sleep.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, physiology-derived measures (robust circadian amplitude, clear nocturnal heart-rate dipping, above-average median sleep duration, and strong day-to-day rhythm consistency) point toward objectively favorable sleep conditions and would be expected to support a lower PSQI score. Countervailing influences—particularly late habitual bedtimes, marked night-to-night duration variability, and elevated trait anxiety—create risk for elevated PSQI, especially on subjective components (sleep latency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction). Considering the relative magnitudes (strong positive circadian markers with high Z-scores vs. moderate psychological and behavioral risk markers), the net signal favors somewhat better-than-average sleep quality. Therefore, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI below the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). This conclusion acknowledges uncertainty: subjective complaints could still be present because of anxiety and irregular total sleep across nights even while objective circadian physiology appears favorable.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation: Correlations between many wearable metrics and PSQI are modest in this sample, and PSQI is influenced by subjective elements not fully captured by physiology. The strongest sample-level correlates of PSQI in this dataset are depressive symptom burden (CES-D) and trait anxiety; the participant’s CES-D is low but trait anxiety is elevated, which increases uncertainty about subjective sleep quality. In sum, objective physiology and average duration argue for below-mean PSQI (better sleep), but behavioral timing and anxiety warrant attention as potential contributors to worse subjective sleep or intermittent poor nights."
56805,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian physiology:
Wearable-recorded sleep and heart-rate data indicate a clear pattern of short, late-timed nocturnal sleep embedded within an otherwise physiologically robust daytime rhythm. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 5 hours 33 minutes (Z = -2.02 relative to the study sample), and median sleep start time was about 01:20 AM, with sleep start variability modest (SD ~54 minutes, Z ≈ -0.63). Heart-rate cosinor metrics show a relatively low mesor (64.45 bpm, Z = -1.30) and a typical afternoon acrophase (≈3:10 PM). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal dipping (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–5:00 AM, Zs down to about -2.08) and marked daytime rises in the late morning, which is consistent with consolidated nocturnal sleep physiology despite the late timing. Non‑parametric circadian measures indicate only modest day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.30, Z = -0.90) and average intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability ≈ 0.54, Z ≈ -0.04).

Evidence suggesting relatively poorer sleep quality (likely to increase PSQI):
The strongest signal pointing toward worse sleep is the objectively short sleep duration (median 5h33, Z = -2.02), which is well below the sample mean and is a robust contributor to poorer subjective sleep quality in most studies. Late sleep timing (median start ~1:20 AM) also typically associates with greater sleep complaints and daytime dysfunction even when physiological sleep architecture appears intact. Modest interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.90) suggests some irregularity in daily scheduling, which can contribute to perceived poor sleep. Finally, sleep duration variability (SD ~75 min) and the late-night heart-rate pattern (large nocturnal dips followed by relatively sharp morning rises) may reflect compressed sleep opportunity and circadian misalignment that are commonly associated with higher PSQI scores.

Evidence suggesting relatively better sleep quality (likely to reduce PSQI):
Multiple psychosocial and behavioral indicators point toward lower PSQI risk. The participant reports very low depressive (CES-D = 1, Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety symptoms (STAI = 20, Z = -2.11), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), so low scores here are protective. Self‑esteem and current happiness are relatively high (RSES Z ≈ +1.66; happy Z ≈ +1.64), and health satisfaction is high (Z ≈ +2.05), all of which associate modestly with better sleep in the cohort (negative correlations with PSQI). Lifestyle behaviors — minimal substance use, no naps, regular exercise (frequent group exercise/sports), and limited evening screen or media time — are also consistent with factors that tend to lower PSQI scores. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate (44.2 bpm, Z = -1.66) likely reflects good cardiovascular fitness, which in this sample is not strongly associated with worse sleep (small positive correlation with PSQI ~0.12), and the clear nocturnal heart-rate dip indicates intact sleep-related autonomic lowering rather than fragmented or light sleep physiology.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample:
Weighing the evidence, the dominant objective driver is substantially short sleep duration combined with late sleep timing; these are strong, direct contributors to poorer subjective and objective sleep outcomes. Psychosocial and behavioral factors (low depression/anxiety, high health satisfaction, regular exercise, no naps, limited evening media use) mitigate some of that risk and are consistent with better perceived sleep in this participant. On balance, however, the magnitude of the short sleep duration (Z ≈ -2.02) and late sleep onset make it more likely that this participant’s overall sleep quality would be worse than average in this cohort. Therefore, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI (i.e., worse sleep quality than the sample mean of 6.73). This conclusion emphasizes that, although many protective psychosocial factors are present, compressed and late sleep opportunity is the principal factor driving a likely higher PSQI relative to peers."
26800,"Summary of objective sleep physiology and behavior:
Wearable-recorded sleep duration and nocturnal cardiovascular signals point to generally adequate restorative physiology. Median sleep duration was 7 h 14 min (Z = 0.06), with few naps (mean daily naps 0.07, Z ≈ 0), and overnight heart rate shows a pronounced nocturnal nadir (hourly deviations −15 to −22 bpm between ~3–6 AM) together with a low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z = −1.04). These features—sufficient total sleep time, low resting heart rate, and clear overnight heart-rate reductions—are consistent with intact nocturnal recovery and are features that, in this sample, are weakly associated with lower PSQI (better sleep). By contrast, circadian-regularity metrics indicate reduced day-to-day rhythm strength: interdaily stability is low (0.30, Z = −0.90) and cosinor amplitude is also reduced (amplitude Z = −0.90), while the participant’s median sleep start is relatively late (01:28 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 89 minutes). Lower interdaily stability and reduced amplitude are modestly aligned with poorer PSQI in the study (small correlations), and late/variable sleep timing is a behavioral feature commonly linked to worse subjective sleep.

Psychological, lifestyle, and activity context:
Self-report measures provide additional, mostly protective, context. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 7, Z = −0.66), and trait anxiety is only slightly above the sample mean (STAI = 40, Z = −0.13); self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = +0.96). The CES-D score has the largest positive correlation with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.49), so the low depressive burden here is a notable factor favoring better PSQI. Perceived stress and happiness are near the sample mean or slightly lower (PSS ≈ 21, happiness Z ≈ −0.53), but their correlations with PSQI are modest. Recreational alcohol use is reported at ~1–2 times/week (Z ≈ +1 for beer/wine), though associations between this level of use and PSQI are small in this sample. Overall activity patterns show limited regular exercise with some sport participation (1–2×/week) and a concentrated morning activity peak in heart-rate deviations (large positive deviation 9–10 AM, Z = +2.20), indicating robust daytime activation despite weaker circadian stability.

Factors pointing toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI):
- Late median sleep onset (~01:30 AM) and measurable night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 89 min), which are behaviorally associated with worse subjective sleep and have a small positive correlation with PSQI in this dataset.
- Reduced circadian rhythm strength: low interdaily stability (Z ≈ −0.90) and low amplitude (Z ≈ −0.90), which indicate weaker, less-robust 24-hour organization and—based on the correlations—tend to be associated with higher PSQI.
- Modest trait anxiety and somewhat lower reported happiness, which have small-to-moderate associations with worse PSQI.

Factors pointing toward better sleep quality (lower PSQI):
- Adequate median sleep duration (≈7 h 14 min, Z ≈ 0) and low nap frequency, both of which are associated with more favorable PSQI.
- Strong nocturnal cardiovascular recovery (large overnight heart-rate decreases) and a low resting heart rate (Z = −1.04), physiological indicators that are consistent with good sleep-related autonomic recovery and that, in this sample, weakly predict lower PSQI.
- Low depressive symptom burden (CES-D Z = −0.66) and relatively high self-esteem (Z = +0.96); CES-D in particular has the largest sample correlation with PSQI, so low depressive symptoms are an important protective factor.

Holistic assessment relative to the study population mean:
Weighing the objective physiological strengths (adequate sleep duration, robust nocturnal heart-rate decline, low resting heart rate) and the psychologically protective profile (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem) against the circadian irregularity and late, somewhat variable sleep timing, the overall pattern is most consistent with sleep quality that is comparable to, or modestly better than, the average participant in this study. In other words, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is near the population mean PSQI and likely trends slightly below the population mean PSQI of 6.73 (i.e., marginally better sleep than average), rather than substantially poorer. This conclusion reflects the relatively strong physiological recovery signals and low depressive symptoms—both of which have the strongest links to PSQI in the dataset—partly offset by behavioral circadian irregularity that could elevate subjective sleep complaints.

Uncertainty and interpretation caveats:
Correlations between many wearable metrics and PSQI are small, so individual features have modest predictive weight. The available data combine objective and subjective measures collected across a semester; inferred PSQI here should be treated as an integrated, probabilistic estimate rather than a definitive score."
47142,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of indicators that both protect and threaten sleep quality. Elevated self-reported depressive (CES‑D = 19; Z = 0.59) and trait anxiety symptoms (STAI = 43; Z = 0.17) — scales that correlate positively with PSQI in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.50, STAI r ≈ 0.40) — together with a relatively late habitual sleep onset (median start time 01:39) and a shorter-than-average nightly sleep duration (median 6 h 32 min; Z = −0.81) are the most salient features consistent with poorer subjective sleep quality. In contrast, objective circadian structure derived from heart rate shows relatively strong 24‑hour regularity (interdaily stability = 0.54, Z = 1.08; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.50, Z = 1.48) and low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.36, Z = −1.31), and nocturnal heart‑rate dipping (hourly deviations of −15 to −23 bpm across 2–6 AM) consistent with preserved physiological sleep consolidation — features that typically relate to better sleep quality.

Evidence pointing toward higher PSQI (worse sleep): Psychological symptom burden appears to be the largest risk signal. The CES‑D score is above the study mean (Z = 0.59) and is the survey measure most strongly correlated with PSQI (r ≈ 0.50), indicating that depressive symptom frequency is a likely contributor to elevated PSQI. Trait anxiety (STAI) is likewise above average and moderately PSQI‑related (r ≈ 0.40). Behavioral indicators that map onto shorter or disrupted sleep include the late median sleep start time (~1:40 AM) and a median sleep duration that is about three‑quarters of an hour below the sample mean (Z = −0.81). Napping behavior is an additional concern: mean daily naps = 0.3 (Z = 2.66), a large positive outlier in the sample and modestly correlated with higher PSQI (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting daytime sleepiness or opportunistic sleep that may fragment nocturnal sleep or reflect compensatory behavior. Resting heart rate and MESOR are somewhat elevated (RHR = 65.1 bpm, Z = 0.83; MESOR = 83.6, Z = 1.32), which could index higher baseline physiological arousal — a small positive correlate of PSQI in this dataset.

Evidence pointing toward lower PSQI (better sleep): Objective circadian metrics are relatively favorable. High interdaily stability (Z = 1.08) and high 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.48) indicate regular day‑to‑day timing of activity and physiology, and low intradaily variability (Z = −1.31) indicates limited fragmentation of activity across the day; these features typically associate with better sleep continuity and lower PSQI, although their sample correlations with PSQI are small. Nocturnal heart‑rate profiles show clear dipping overnight (largest deviations ~−22.7 bpm at 4–5 AM), consistent with consolidated sleep physiology on aggregated nights. Low substance use (no reported alcohol or recreational drug use) and at least some regular exercise (exercised alone 1–2×/week; Z = 0.32) are behavioral factors that would tend to protect sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement: Balancing risks and protections, the data indicate a mixed picture but one in which psychological symptom burden (particularly depressive symptoms and anxiety), late habitual bedtimes, relatively short nocturnal sleep, and frequent napping are stronger and more directly PSQI‑related signals than the protective circadian regularity and nocturnal physiological dipping. Given the magnitude of the mood symptom correlations with PSQI in this sample (especially CES‑D r ≈ 0.50) and the participant’s above‑average depressive symptom score and late, short sleep pattern, the overall evidence points toward sleep quality that is likely worse than average in this study sample. In probabilistic terms, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI score above the population mean of 6.73 (i.e., “above the population mean”), rather than near or below it.

Uncertainties and caveats: This inference integrates cross‑sectional survey measures and aggregate wearable statistics; wearable circadian indices are aggregated across days and do not replace night‑by‑night PSQI components or clinical interview. Several objective markers (regularity, nocturnal HR dipping, low intraday variability) argue for at least partially consolidated sleep physiology despite subjective and behavioral indicators of poorer sleep; therefore, the magnitude of any PSQI elevation could be moderate rather than extreme."
60396,"Protective indicators consistent with relatively good sleep quality are prominent in this participant’s data. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 23 minutes (Z = 0.26), and day-to-day variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD = 70 minutes, Z = -0.69), both of which typically predict fewer PSQI complaints about sleep quantity/consistency. Objective circadian/actigraphy-derived features further support a structured rest–activity pattern: low intradaily variability (0.34, Z = -1.45) and a high autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.51, Z = 1.57) indicate consolidated, regular daily rhythms rather than fragmented or highly irregular sleep–wake patterns. Wearable heart-rate features show a clear nocturnal trough (hourly deviations from MESOR are strongly negative across the 2:00–7:00 AM window), consistent with sustained nocturnal physiological downregulation that usually accompanies restorative sleep. Low mean nap frequency (0.07 naps/day, Z ≈ -0.08) and a modestly active lifestyle—especially frequent social exercise (exercised with others, three+ times/week; Z = 1.23)—are additional behavioral factors that tend to be associated with better sleep quality.

Conversely, several features point toward risk for elevated PSQI scores (poorer subjective sleep). The participant’s typical sleep start time is late (median start ≈ 01:46 AM) which can increase difficulty with daytime functioning and contribute to some PSQI component scores even when total sleep time is adequate. Wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated evening arousal peaking in the 7–9 PM window (deviations ~18–19 bpm above MESOR; Zs ≈ 1.15–1.64), which may reflect heightened evening physiological activation that could delay sleep onset or reduce perceived sleep quality. Psychological trait measures include a modestly elevated trait anxiety score (STAI = 42, Z = 0.07), and self-reported perceived stress is non-negligible (PSS = 21); both anxiety and stress are positively correlated with PSQI in the study sample (STAI–PSQI r ≈ 0.40; CESD r ≈ 0.49 for depressive symptoms). Alcohol use at a frequency of 1–2 times per week (beer and wine/liquor) and a somewhat lower resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z = -1.04) are present; the substance-use correlations with PSQI in this sample are small but non-zero and could contribute to variability in subjective sleep quality on certain nights.

When weighing all evidence, the balance favors somewhat better-than-average objective sleep regularity and quantity but with notable caveats related to late timing and evening arousal that may increase subjective sleep complaints. Taken together, these patterns are most consistent with overall sleep quality near to, but slightly better than, the study population average. In other words, the participant’s inferred PSQI is likely below the population mean PSQI of 6.73 (study SD = 2.16), reflecting relatively preserved sleep duration and circadian regularity despite later bedtimes and some anxiety-related risk factors.

Limitations and interpretive cautions: conclusions are probabilistic and based on correlational associations and aggregated physiological summaries rather than a measured PSQI score on the same nights. The hourly heart-rate deviations are aggregate averages (not nightly time-series) and cannot resolve night-to-night variability in arousal or discrete sleep disturbances. Where possible, subjective PSQI items and night-level sleep diaries would refine the inference about perceived sleep quality and daytime dysfunction."
92412,"Summary of features consistent with relatively good sleep quality:
The wearable-recorded sleep durations and behavioral context provide multiple signals that favor relatively good sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 48 minutes (Z = +0.76), which is above the study mean and falls in a range generally associated with restorative sleep. Night-to-night variability in both sleep duration (SD = 62 minutes, Z = −0.87) and sleep onset time (median start 00:54, start-time SD = 49 minutes, Z = −0.74) are relatively low compared with the sample, indicating consistent sleep length and timing across the semester. The participant reports essentially no daytime napping and no recreational substance use, engages in regular exercise (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more) and reports low perceived stress, low depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 3, STAI = 32), and relatively high happiness and self-esteem — psychosocial factors that are typically associated with lower PSQI scores. Physiologically, nocturnal heart-rate values show a pronounced downward deviation from the mesor throughout the usual sleep window (roughly −18 to −20 bpm between ~2:00–7:00 AM), and resting heart rate is low (53 bpm), both of which are consistent with consolidated nighttime physiological quiescence and relatively good cardiovascular recovery during sleep. Circadian amplitude is moderately elevated (amplitude Z = +0.74) and acrophase around early evening (~6:03 PM) is within an expected diurnal pattern, suggesting a robust day–night rhythm that supports sleep consolidation.

Features that could be associated with poorer sleep quality:
There are some wearable-derived rhythmicity metrics that point toward elements associated with worse sleep. Intradaily variability (IV = 0.66, Z = +0.81) is relatively elevated, which can indicate greater fragmentation of activity/rest transitions within days; higher IV is sometimes associated with sleep fragmentation and poorer subjective sleep. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is modestly low (0.29, Z = −0.28) and interdaily stability is only moderate (0.43, Z = +0.17), suggesting the circadian rhythm is present but not exceptionally regular from day to day. The participant’s median sleep start time (around 00:54) is relatively late, which could contribute to difficulties when early morning obligations require earlier wake times (a factor that can worsen PSQI for some individuals). The aggregate hourly heart-rate profile shows a very large positive deviation in the early evening (notably 5–6 PM, value +39.22, Z = +4.19), which likely reflects vigorous late-day activity but could reflect late physiological arousal if activity is closer to bedtime; the correlations between that evening spike and PSQI are small in this sample, however. Taken together, these features suggest some within-day fragmentation and modest day-to-day irregularity that could elevate sleep complaints even in the presence of generally adequate sleep duration.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI:
Balancing the evidence, the participant shows more indicators of healthy sleep (adequate and stable sleep duration, low variability, strong nocturnal heart-rate reduction, low mood/stress symptoms, regular exercise, no substances or naps) than indicators of poor sleep (moderately elevated intradaily variability, modest autocorrelation/stability, and a late but consistent sleep onset). On net, these data are most consistent with sleep quality that is better than average in this sample. Therefore, relative to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s pattern of behavioral, psychosocial, and physiological markers suggests an overall sleep quality level that is below the population mean PSQI (i.e., comparatively better sleep). 

Caveats:
This conclusion is inferential: it integrates objective wearable metrics, trait and symptom self-reports, and behavioral habits, but it does not replace a direct PSQI score or clinical assessment. Some circadian fragmentation signals (elevated IV and reduced 24-h autocorrelation) warrant attention because they could produce subjective sleep complaints even when duration appears adequate; if sleep problems are reported by the participant, follow-up with PSQI component scores or sleep diary data would help clarify specific domains (e.g., sleep latency, disturbances, daytime dysfunction) for targeted recommendations."
92038,"Summary — integrated behavioral and physiological profile:
Across the recording period this participant shows a mixture of objective and self-reported indicators that together describe generally adequate sleep quantity but relatively late and variable sleep timing and a circadian pattern with notable intraday fragmentation. Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration (7 h 36 min; Z = 0.52) is above the study mean, and daily napping is absent (Z = -0.86), while resting heart rate (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56) and a pronounced day–night heart rate amplitude (amplitude = 13.83, Z = 0.99) are consistent with robust nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation. At the same time the participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:27) and both sleep duration and sleep-start time show elevated night-to-night variability (duration SD = 145 min, Z = 1.0; sleep-start SD = 114 min, Z = 0.69). Non-parametric circadian metrics indicate modestly reduced interdaily stability (0.39, Z = -0.16) and elevated intradaily variability (0.72, Z = 1.23), implying more fragmentation of activity/physiology across the day.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality (factors associated with higher PSQI):
- Late and inconsistent sleep timing: the late median sleep-start (~01:27) and relatively high nightly variability in both sleep onset and sleep duration (Z ≈ 0.7–1.0) are established behavioral patterns that tend to co-occur with worse subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. In this dataset, variability measures also have small positive correlations with PSQI (sleep-duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep-start SD r ≈ 0.18), suggesting greater irregularity relates to poorer PSQI in the sample.  
- Elevated intradaily variability and reduced 24-h regularity: the intradaily variability (Z = 1.23) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = -0.87) indicate fragmented and less-consistent circadian structure, features that are commonly associated with degraded sleep consolidation and higher PSQI in population studies.  
- Signs of evening/night arousal on aggregated heart-rate: an above-mesor aggregated deviation around midnight (12–1 am: +5.4, Z = 1.03) and modestly elevated deviations clustered in the late evening could reflect later-evening physiological arousal or activity that would be expected to interfere with sleep initiation and contribute to subjective disturbance.

Evidence pointing toward relatively better sleep quality (factors associated with lower PSQI):
- Adequate total sleep time and lack of naps: median sleep duration exceeds 7.5 hours and the participant reports virtually no naps; both features are associated with better subjective sleep quality and lower PSQI in the sample (duration has small negative relationship with better outcomes).  
- Favorable psychological and lifestyle profile: low depressive and trait-anxiety symptom scores (CES-D Z = -1.18; STAI Z = -1.02), high self-esteem (Z = 1.66) and above-average self-reported happiness and health satisfaction (Z ≈ 1.3–1.64) are all psychosocial factors that, in this dataset, are correlated with lower PSQI (e.g., CES-D and STAI have moderate positive correlations with PSQI, and self-esteem/happiness have negative correlations). Frequent exercise (three or more times per week; exercise Z > 1) further aligns with better sleep in the sample.  
- Normal nocturnal cardiovascular suppression: the large negative hourly heart-rate deviations during typical sleep hours (e.g., 2–7 am values ~ -16 to -23) and a relatively low resting heart rate indicate normal nocturnal physiologic downregulation, which generally supports sleep consolidation rather than fragmentation.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI:
Weighing the evidence, this participant presents a mixed profile: several robust protective features (adequate median sleep duration, minimal napping, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, regular exercise, and normal nocturnal heart-rate suppression) favor relatively good subjective sleep, while late habitual bedtimes and elevated night-to-night variability in both timing and duration, together with elevated intradaily variability of activity/physiology, are meaningful risk factors for worse subjective sleep. Given the balance of stronger protective psychosocial and quantity indicators against the timing/regularity risks, the most supported inference is that the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely at or somewhat better than the study sample average — i.e., at or slightly below the population mean PSQI score of 6.73 (the phrasing “below the population mean” indicates somewhat better sleep quality). This conclusion is provisional: the participant’s late and irregular sleep schedule represent clear targets that could produce episodic or situational increases in PSQI-like complaints despite otherwise favorable sleep-supporting features.  

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation:
Correlations between many individual metrics and PSQI in this dataset are small or mixed, so conclusions rely on the pattern of multiple converging measures rather than any single strong predictor. The analysis uses aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations and summary circadian metrics, which reflect typical day-to-day physiology but do not provide date-specific event-level context (e.g., occasional all-nighters)."
86440,"Factors indicating relatively poorer sleep quality: Several wearable-derived circadian metrics suggest the participant’s sleep–wake physiology is somewhat less robust than the study sample. The cosinor amplitude is reduced (8.91, Z = -0.60), and interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.39, Z = -0.16), which together indicate a weaker and slightly less regular circadian organization of heart-rate patterns across days. Intradaily variability is marginally elevated (0.56, Z = 0.10), implying more within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology; although the correlation of these metrics with PSQI is small in this sample, lower amplitude and stability have modest associations with poorer sleep in some models (amplitude correlation with PSQI ≈ -0.11). The participant’s typical sleep start time is relatively late (median ~00:50), which can be associated with eveningness-related sleep complaints in student populations and may contribute to subjective sleep disturbances even when total duration is adequate. Finally, while variability in sleep timing is not large here (sleep-start SD = 51 min, Z = -0.70), the presence of any evening-skewed timing combined with reduced circadian amplitude creates a plausible pathway to increased sleep complaints.

Factors indicating relatively better sleep quality: Several behavioral, self-report, and physiological indicators favor better-than-average sleep. Median nocturnal sleep duration is about 7 hours 1 minute (Z = -0.21), close to the sample mean and within a typical healthy range; mean daily naps are zero (Z = -0.86), reducing the likelihood of daytime sleep interference. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) and below-average perceived stress (PSS = 19, Z = -0.71), both of which are protective against elevated PSQI in this sample (CES-D has a relatively strong positive correlation with PSQI, r ≈ 0.49). Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33), self-esteem is high (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17; RSES correlates negatively with PSQI), and current happiness is above average (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55). Objective cardiovascular indices also suggest favorable physiology: resting heart rate is low (51 bpm, Z = -0.85) and the hourly heart-rate profile shows a clear nocturnal dip (nighttime deviations down to ≈ -20 bpm), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest. Low reported substance use and lack of napping are additional behavioral features that typically protect sleep continuity.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population: Weighing the evidence, the participant shows more indicators consistent with relatively good sleep health than with severe sleep disturbance. Behavioral and psychosocial variables that strongly correlate with PSQI (notably depressive symptoms and perceived stress) are below the sample mean, and objective markers such as sufficient median sleep duration, absence of naps, low resting heart rate, and a clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir argue for consolidated nocturnal sleep. Countervailing signals are the reduced circadian amplitude and slightly lower interdaily stability (weaker circadian structure) and a relatively late median sleep onset (~00:50), which could elevate subjective sleep complaints for some individuals. Overall, the pattern is best characterized as near the sample mean in PSQI, with a modest lean toward better-than-average sleep quality. In phrasing relative to the study population mean PSQI (mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with a PSQI at or slightly below the population mean (i.e., similar to or somewhat better than average sleep quality).

Implications for interpretation: The strongest concerns to monitor would be the reduced circadian amplitude and evening sleep timing, which could be targeted by behavioral interventions (earlier, consistent sleep timing; light exposure and activity scheduling) if subjective sleep problems emerge. Conversely, low mood and stress levels, minimal substance use, and physiological signs of fitness support resilience in sleep. This synthesis integrates small-to-moderate effect-size associations from the sample and should be interpreted as a probabilistic inference about sleep quality rather than a direct PSQI score."
29792,"Summary overview: The multimodal profile shows a mixture of behavioral, subjective, and physiological signals. The participant reports moderately low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 13, near the study mean) and relatively high self-esteem and health satisfaction, while trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17). Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures reveal a markedly delayed sleep schedule (median sleep start 04:31:59), somewhat short median sleep duration (6 h 11 min, Z = -1.25), and a distinct pattern of elevated cardiovascular activity around late-night hours. Taken together, these features point to both protective and risk factors for sleep quality; on balance the pattern is more consistent with sleep quality that is worse than the sample average.

Factors consistent with poorer sleep quality (predicting a higher PSQI): 
- Sleep timing: The median sleep start time of ~04:32 AM represents pronounced eveningness/circadian delay. Delayed sleep timing is frequently associated with sleep disturbance and daytime impairment and is a strong behavioral marker that tends to increase PSQI scores.
- Shorter-than-average sleep: Median sleep duration of 6 h 11 min (Z = -1.25) is below the sample mean and below commonly recommended durations; shorter sleep is associated with worse self-reported sleep quality and daytime symptoms.
- Nighttime physiological arousal: Hourly heart-rate deviations show higher-than-average values around midnight–2 AM (12–1 AM: +9.13 bpm, Z = 1.56; 1–2 AM: +3.48 bpm, Z = 1.59) and smaller drops in the early night, which suggest greater nocturnal physiological activation around the participant’s sleep-onset window. These late-night elevations correlate positively (modestly) with PSQI in the sample (e.g., 2–4 AM correlations up to r ≈ 0.23), indicating these patterns are associated with poorer subjective sleep in this study.
- Substance use patterns: Relatively frequent beer consumption (three times/week or more; Z = 1.72) and weekly wine/liquor use may contribute to sleep fragmentation or poorer sleep continuity even if correlations here are small; alcohol use around bedtime commonly degrades sleep quality.
- Trait anxiety: STAI trait score has a positive correlation with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.40); the participant’s elevated trait anxiety (Z = 0.17) is therefore a plausible contributor to poorer subjective sleep.

Factors consistent with relatively better sleep quality (predicting a lower PSQI):
- Physiological fitness/resting cardiovascular tone: Resting heart rate is low (52 bpm, Z = -0.73), a feature often associated with better cardiovascular fitness and sometimes better sleep consolidation.
- Regularity and low fragmentation: Interdaily stability is modestly above average (value 0.46, Z = 0.42) and intradaily variability is not elevated (value 0.5, Z = -0.32). These non-parametric circadian features indicate moderately stable daily structure and relatively low fragmentation of activity rhythms, properties that tend to support better sleep quality.
- Low nap burden: Mean daily naps = 0 (Z = -0.86) suggests limited daytime napping, which can help preserve nocturnal sleep drive and reduce sleep fragmentation.
- Positive psychosocial factors: Higher self-esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26), above-average happiness (Z = 0.55), and reasonable health satisfaction (Z = 0.22) are all inversely correlated with PSQI in the sample and may protect against severe subjective sleep complaints.
- Moderate exercise and social activity: Frequent exercise with others (three times/week or more, Z = 1.23) and some regular socializing are behaviors that often support sleep consolidation and daytime functioning.

Circadian and aggregate physiological interpretation: Cosinor-derived summary metrics show a mesor ~69.9 bpm (Z = -0.55) and amplitude near the sample mean (10.89, Z = 0.04) with acrophase around 7:39 PM. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.19, Z = -1.12), indicating weaker day-to-day persistence of the heart-rate rhythm than typical in the sample, whereas interdaily stability is modestly positive. The combination of a preserved amplitude but lower 24-hr autocorrelation and a very late acrophase/sleep start suggests that the participant’s circadian phase is shifted (late timing) and that the rhythm is periodically less tightly coupled across days. The late-night elevation in heart rate around the participant’s sleep onset window is congruent with phase delay plus nocturnal arousal and has modest positive correlations with PSQI in the sample.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s profile is more consistent with a higher (worse) PSQI score than the study mean. The most influential indicators are the extreme delayed sleep timing (median start ≈ 04:32 AM), shorter median sleep duration (≈6 h 11 min), and elevated late-night heart rate—each of which is commonly linked with greater subjective sleep problems and higher PSQI scores. Protective features (low resting heart rate, some circadian stability, limited napping, positive self-report indices) mitigate risk but do not fully offset the behavioral and physiological signs of circadian misalignment and nocturnal arousal. Therefore, relative to the population mean PSQI of 6.72, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is likely above the population mean (i.e., worse than average) rather than near or below it."
14737,"Summary: The multimodal data portray a mixed picture in which behavioral and psychological features point toward sleep disturbance risk while physiological signals contain some evidence of consolidated nocturnal rest. The participant’s wearable-recorded median sleep duration is relatively short (6 hours 3 minutes; Z = -1.41) and sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:47) with high night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 135 minutes; Z = 1.14). Trait anxiety (STAI = 45; Z = 0.37) and modest depressive symptom score (CES-D = 14; Z = 0.07) are present; both scales show positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.40; CES-D r ≈ 0.49). Taking the full pattern together, the balance of risk indicators suggests this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the study population mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average).

Evidence consistent with higher PSQI (poorer sleep): Short median sleep duration and large variability are established contributors to poorer subjective sleep quality and are strongly represented here (median 6:03, Z = -1.41; sleep duration SD = 133 min, Z = 0.74). Late and irregular sleep timing (median start ~01:47 and large start-time SD) tends to elevate PSQI scores and daytime impairment. Intradaily variability of the heart-rate circadian signal is moderately elevated (IV = 0.64, Z = 0.67), which in this sample is associated with less regular rest–activity structure and correlates in the expected direction with worse PSQI. Behavioral correlates that increase risk include low exercise frequency, high sedentary hobby time, and limited socializing — all of which are either negatively associated with restorative sleep in the literature or have been associated with higher PSQI in this cohort. Finally, trait anxiety (moderate, STAI Z = 0.37) and the CES-D correlation with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.49) indicate psychological symptom burden that may be contributing to poorer subjective sleep.

Evidence consistent with lower PSQI (better sleep): Physiological heart-rate patterns show a pronounced nocturnal decline in mean heart rate (large negative deviations from mesor overnight, e.g., ~ -26 bpm at 5–6 AM, Z ≈ -1.11), which is consistent with consolidated physiological sleep and preserved nocturnal autonomic downregulation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm; Z = -0.47), consistent with cardiorespiratory fitness and generally favorable physiology. Interdaily stability of the circadian heart-rate rhythm is slightly above average (0.45, Z = 0.33), suggesting some day-to-day regularity in overall timing. Reported substance use is essentially absent (no alcohol or recreational drug use), naps are minimal (mean daily naps 0.07), and self-reported stress and health satisfaction are around or below study-average stress levels (PSS Z = -0.44; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.53), all factors that tend to protect sleep quality.

Integration of circadian and hourly physiology: The cosinor-derived amplitude is modestly above average (amplitude Z = 0.53) and acrophase places peak heart-rate activity in late afternoon (~4:54 PM), a typical timing for daytime activity. The hourly aggregate deviations show elevated evening cardiovascular activation (notably 6–7 PM, +22 bpm, Z = 1.65) and small elevations at the very early night hour (12–1 AM, +3.4 bpm, Z = 0.75), which together with a late sleep onset suggest an extended evening wake period with physiological activation that could delay sleep. Conversely, the deep overnight reductions in heart rate indicate that when sleep occurs the autonomic profile is consistent with physiologic sleep consolidation rather than fragmented rest. Non-parametric circadian measures (moderate interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability) suggest a rhythm that is regular in some respects but with notable within-day fragmentation or variability that could translate to inconsistent sleep quality across nights.

Holistic conclusion relative to the sample mean: Balancing risk and protective signals, the preponderance of behavioral and psychological indicators (short and irregular sleep, late sleep timing, moderate trait anxiety, low physical activity) outweigh the physiological signs of a robust nocturnal heart-rate nadir. Therefore the participant’s inferred sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI score above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73). This is an inference rather than a direct PSQI measurement; it is driven chiefly by short nightly sleep, high variability in timing and duration, and psychosocial risk factors that are associated with higher PSQI in this cohort."
28653,"Summary of features consistent with relatively good sleep quality
The participant’s profile contains multiple converging indicators that would be expected to push their PSQI score below the study population mean (i.e., toward better sleep). Objectively, wearable circadian metrics show a robust, regular rhythm: interdaily stability (Z = +1.41) and 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = +1.40) are elevated, intradaily variability is markedly low (Z = −2.08), and cosinor amplitude is high (Z = +2.26). Together these indicate a strong, consolidated day–night pattern in heart rate with little within‑day fragmentation — a pattern that is typically associated with better sleep continuity and lower PSQI. Nocturnal heart‑rate deviations show pronounced overnight declines (largest negative deviations −24 to −28 bpm in the 2:00–6:00 a.m. window), consistent with clear nocturnal autonomic down‑regulation during sleep. Wearable sleep statistics also favor good sleep: median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 4 min; Z = +1.10) and the participant reports essentially no daytime napping (Z = −0.86). Self‑report measures further support better sleep: low depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 6, Z = −0.76), low trait anxiety (STAI = 29, Z = −1.22), above‑average self‑esteem (Z = +1.52), high health satisfaction (Z = +1.63), and general happiness (Z = +1.64) are all psychosocial profiles that tend to be associated with lower PSQI scores.

Features that could contribute to worse sleep quality
There are a few signals that work in the opposite direction and could modestly elevate PSQI. Night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing and duration is non‑negligible: sleep start time SD is ~107 minutes (Z = +0.53) and sleep duration SD is ~100 minutes (Z ≈ 0), and these variability measures have small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18; duration SD r ≈ 0.20). The participant’s typical sleep onset is shortly after midnight (median start ~00:16), which is a later bedtime that in some contexts is associated with reduced sleep efficiency or day–evening misalignment. Alcohol and substance use are low (infrequent), so substance‑related sleep disruption is unlikely, but the modest variability in bedtime and sleep length remains the main behavioral factor that can worsen subjective sleep quality. A few hourly heart‑rate deviation correlations with PSQI are small and positive in the overnight hours (e.g., 2–4 a.m. correlations ~0.20), suggesting that some nocturnal physiological features show weak associations with worse PSQI in the broader sample; however, these correlations are small and should be interpreted cautiously.

Interpretation of the wearable circadian and physiological profile
Physiologically the participant shows a strong circadian amplitude and pronounced daytime versus nighttime separation in cardiovascular activity: daytime hours (particularly mid to late afternoon) show large positive deviations from the mesor while night hours show large negative deviations. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53 bpm; Z = −0.61), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness/parasympathetic tone and generally favorable for sleep. Low intradaily variability combined with high amplitude and relatively high interdaily stability point to consolidated sleep–wake organization across the recording period; these are among the stronger wearable‑derived signals in the dataset (several Z‑scores > |1.4| and intradaily variability Z = −2.08) and likely reflect objectively lower sleep fragmentation and better sleep continuity.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of objective and self‑report indicators point toward better‑than‑average sleep quality for this participant. Strong circadian regularity, high amplitude, long median sleep duration, low resting heart rate, and low levels of depression and anxiety are robust factors associated with lower PSQI scores in the sample. The principal countervailing evidence is moderate variability in bedtime and occasional night‑to‑night duration variability, which could modestly raise subjective complaints captured by PSQI. On balance, the data support an inference that the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely below the population mean PSQI of 6.73 (i.e., better than the average study participant), while noting a small risk that irregular sleep timing could produce intermittent poorer nights. This conclusion is probabilistic and descriptive: it integrates multiple small and large effects rather than asserting a categorical clinical determination."
95559,"Summary of psychological and behavioral context: Self-report instruments collected near the end of the semester indicate relatively low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 8, Z ≈ -0.55) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 29, Z ≈ -1.22), along with above‑average self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ 0.96). Perceived stress and current happiness are slightly below the study mean (PSS Z ≈ -0.44; happiness Z ≈ -0.53). Alcohol use is elevated relative to the sample (beer use “three times a week or more,” Z ≈ 1.72; wine/liquor Z ≈ 0.94). Exercise and social activity are modest (typically 1–2 times per week). These self‑report features yield a mixed behavioral background in which psychological symptom burden is low (protective for sleep) while some lifestyle factors (frequent alcohol) could undermine sleep continuity and quality.

Wearable‑derived sleep and circadian summary: Objectively measured sleep timing is late and somewhat irregular: median sleep start is about 02:10 AM with a start‑time SD ≈ 88 minutes, and median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 39 min (Z ≈ -0.66), shorter than the study mean. Nap frequency is elevated (mean daily naps = 0.25, Z ≈ 2.07). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show relatively low interdaily stability (0.17, Z ≈ -1.98), low intradaily variability (0.29, Z ≈ -1.80), and a blunted amplitude (7.19, Z ≈ -1.16); mesor and resting heart rate are slightly below sample mean (resting HR ≈ 54 bpm, mesor ≈ 71 bpm). Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations show the expected overnight dip (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM), indicating nocturnal cardiovascular down‑regulation during typical sleep hours.

Evidence suggesting higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): Several features are commonly associated with worse subjective sleep in the study sample and in the literature. Late sleep timing (median start ~02:10 AM) and a shorter median nightly duration (≈6 h 39 min; Z ≈ -0.66) both tend to co‑occur with higher PSQI scores. Elevated nap frequency (Z ≈ 2.07) and relatively frequent alcohol consumption (beer use Z ≈ 1.72) are behavioral factors that can fragment nocturnal sleep and are aligned with increased PSQI in similar samples. Weak interdaily stability and reduced circadian amplitude (both well below the sample mean) indicate a less robust or irregular circadian organization, which is associated with worse perceived sleep. Sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 97 minutes) and sleep start variability (SD ≈ 88 minutes) also indicate irregular timing and amount, and both variability measures here have modest positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (consistent with reduced sleep quality).

Evidence suggesting lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Conversely, the participant reports low depressive symptomatology and low trait anxiety—two psychological factors that, in this dataset, correlate positively with PSQI (higher mood/anxiety scores relate to worse sleep), so the participant’s low scores are protective. Resting heart rate is relatively low (≈54 bpm), and the wearable data show a clear nocturnal heart rate dip through the early morning hours — physiological signs consistent with restorative sleep and good autonomic down‑regulation at night. Self‑reported stress and health satisfaction are slightly better than some peers (z slightly below mean for stress, health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.53), and regular though modest physical activity is present; these features are modestly associated with better sleep outcomes.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the objective and subjective information, the profile is mixed. Protective psychological characteristics (low depression/anxiety, higher self‑esteem, low resting HR and clear nocturnal HR dipping) would tend to predict relatively good subjective sleep, while behavioral and circadian features (late and variable sleep timing, shorter median duration, elevated napping, frequent beer use, and low interdaily stability/low amplitude) are more typical of participants with higher PSQI (poorer sleep). Taken together, the preponderance of circadian‑timing irregularities and behavioral risk factors suggest that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely somewhat worse than average in this sample. Therefore, relative to the study population mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD 2.16), the participant’s inferred sleep quality most plausibly falls above the population mean (i.e., poorer-than-average sleep), though not necessarily at an extreme level given the mitigating psychological and autonomic indicators.

Key actionable inferences for follow‑up or intervention: If the goal is to improve subjective sleep quality, priority targets suggested by these data are advancing and regularizing sleep timing, reducing late‑night alcohol use, and limiting daytime napping. Interventions that strengthen circadian regularity (consistent sleep–wake schedule, morning light exposure, and reducing evening stimulants) would directly address the low interdaily stability and low amplitude observed in the wearable data and are consistent with the mixed protective and risk profile shown here."
30152,"Summary of multimodal sleep and circadian profiles: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration of 6 hours 48 minutes (Z = -0.48), with substantial night-to-night variability in both duration (SD = 118 minutes, Z = 0.39) and sleep start time (median start 02:28, start-time SD = 102 minutes, Z = 0.41). Circadian structure derived from heart rate is relatively weak: interdaily stability is below the study mean (0.35, Z = -0.49) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is low (0.15, Z = -1.45), indicating reduced day-to-day regularity of the heart rate rhythm. The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are lower than the sample mean (RHR = 49.4 bpm, Z = -1.04; mesor = 62.7, Z = -1.54), and daytime heart-rate deviations show pronounced afternoon/evening peaks (largest positive deviations between ~3–6 pm) and clear nocturnal decreases, consistent with a physiologically normal overnight drop in cardiovascular activity despite the late clock time of sleep onset.

Evidence suggesting a higher PSQI score (poorer sleep quality): Several behavioral and physiological features point toward factors that commonly relate to poorer subjective sleep. The very late median sleep start (~2:28 AM) combined with a large standard deviation in sleep timing indicates a late and irregular sleep schedule — patterns associated with greater sleep complaints and worse PSQI components (e.g., sleep latency, sleep disturbance). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD ~2 hours), and variability measures here have modest positive correlations with PSQI in the study (sleep-duration SD correlation ≈ 0.20; start-time SD correlation ≈ 0.18), so inconsistency in sleep timing and duration is likely to contribute to worse subjective sleep. Psychologically, perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) and trait anxiety is above the population mean (STAI = 41, Z ≈ -0.03 but classification “anxious”), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in the sample (stress r ≈ 0.20; STAI r ≈ 0.40), suggesting these internal states could amplify sleep problems. Low interdaily stability and a weak 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate (Zs ≈ -0.49 and -1.45) imply poor circadian regularity, another factor that tends to co-occur with worse self-reported sleep quality.

Evidence suggesting a lower PSQI score (better sleep quality): Several health and behavior indicators would be expected to protect sleep or be associated with better subjective sleep. Median total sleep time is not dramatically reduced (about 6 h 48 m), which is near but slightly below sample average rather than severely short, and the participant reports very little napping (mean daily naps = 0.07, Z ≈ -0.02). Physical activity habits include exercising alone three or more times per week (Z ≈ 1.07), a behavior that typically supports sleep continuity and efficiency (exercise correlation with PSQI modestly negative). Substance use is low (no beer, no recreational or non-prescribed drugs; moderate wine consumption), and overall health satisfaction is high (score = 6/7, Z = 1.3), both of which are features associated with more favorable sleep reports in this cohort. Objective cardiovascular indicators (low resting heart rate, low mesor) are consistent with good cardiorespiratory fitness, which is generally associated with improved sleep physiology.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile. Protective factors (regular exercise, low naps, low substance use, high health satisfaction, favorable resting heart rate) mitigate some sleep risk, and median total sleep time is not extreme. However, the combination of a consistently late sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:28), elevated variability in both timing and duration, reduced interdaily stability and 24-hour rhythm strength, plus elevated perceived stress and trait anxiety, are cohesive indicators that subjective sleep quality is likely compromised for this individual. Given the relative magnitudes and the known associations in the sample, the net pattern is more consistent with a PSQI above the sample mean (i.e., worse sleep quality than average). In other words, the participant’s inferred overall sleep quality would most likely fall “above the population mean” PSQI (population mean = 6.72), reflecting greater sleep complaints relative to the study sample, though the presence of several healthful behaviors suggests the degree of sleep disruption may be moderate rather than severe."
59592,"Factors in the data that point toward relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI) include several psychological, behavioral, and circadian markers. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) and, in this sample, trait anxiety shows a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.40), making it a salient contributor to sleep complaints. Perceived stress is also above average (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38; correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.20), and self-reported happiness and self-esteem are below the sample mean (Happiness Z = -0.53; Self-Esteem Z = -0.45), each of which is associated in this dataset with worse sleep. Objective circadian and activity features provide additional evidence for compromised sleep: intradaily variability is high (0.78, Z = 1.65), indicating a fragmented rest–activity pattern across the day, and interdaily stability is low (0.30, Z = -0.90), suggesting relatively weak day-to-day regularity. The cosinor amplitude is reduced (amplitude = 6.93, Z = -1.25), consistent with a blunted circadian rhythm, and resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (66.1 bpm, Z = 0.95). Together these physiological markers (fragmentation, weak stability, blunted amplitude, higher resting HR) are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and elevated PSQI in the study sample.

Behaviors and sleep-timing factors that are likely to contribute to higher PSQI are present as well. Median sleep start time is late (01:49), which commonly maps onto later sleep opportunity and can degrade sleep duration or quality; watching television/videos is relatively high (1–2 hours, Z = 1.28), and evening screen time and sedentary recreation are modestly elevated—behavioral patterns that often co-occur with later bedtimes and sleep disturbances. Although median sleep duration is close to seven hours (6 h 57 m, Z = -0.29), which might appear near adequate in quantity, the combination of late timing, elevated anxiety/stress and fragmented circadian activity increases the likelihood that sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality are reduced (several of these factors show positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset).

Countervailing evidence consistent with relatively better sleep (lower PSQI) is also present and should temper interpretation. The participant reports low use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs, limited beer consumption, and only moderate alcohol use (wine/liquor ~1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94), which reduces substance-related sleep disruption risk. Napping is uncommon (mean daily naps = 0.12, Z = 0.61 but low absolute value), and sleep start time variability is actually low (SD of sleep start = 39 minutes, Z = -0.97), indicating a relatively consistent bedtime despite its lateness; consistent timing is usually protective for sleep continuity. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are not elevated (score = 14, classified “Not depressed,” Z = 0.07), and overall BMI (19.3) is in a lean range, both of which reduce the likelihood of some sleep disorders that would markedly increase PSQI. Some daytime heart-rate elevations (MESOR = 77.3, Z = 0.46) and the clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir (hourly deviations of roughly -11 to -12 bpm between ~2–7 AM) indicate preserved nocturnal cardiovascular downshift, which is compatible with preserved physiological sleep-related recovery.

Weighing the evidence holistically, the strongest signals in relation to PSQI in this dataset are the participant’s elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress (both positively correlated with PSQI), the high intradaily variability and reduced circadian amplitude (large Z deviations in fragmentation and amplitude), the relatively late median sleep onset (01:49), and a modestly elevated resting heart rate. Protective factors (low substance use, low nap frequency, regular sleep start time, absence of marked depressive symptoms) reduce the probability of very severe sleep impairment. On balance, the profile is more consistent with a modestly elevated likelihood of poorer sleep relative to the study sample mean. In the context of the sample PSQI distribution (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the combined pattern of risk and physiology suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average), though the magnitude of that deviation is probably moderate rather than extreme given the presence of several protective features.

Practical implications for interpretation: factors most likely contributing to higher PSQI in this participant are elevated anxiety/stress, late habitual sleep timing, and circadian fragmentation/blunted amplitude; factors that could mitigate poor sleep are low substance use, consistent bedtimes (despite lateness), and lack of significant depressive symptoms. Interventions or further assessments that target evening timing, stress and anxiety, and strengthening day–night regularity (increasing circadian amplitude and interdaily stability) would be the most direct routes to test whether PSQI would move toward or below the sample mean."
89652,"Summary: The dataset presents a mixed but coherent pattern in which behavioral and physiological measures point to relatively irregular and late-timed sleep with moderate sleep duration, while self-report psychosocial measures generally index preserved mood and low substance use. Key wearable features that are most likely to drive elevated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores are the very late median sleep start time (02:54:29), a below‑average median nightly sleep duration (6 h 34 min; Z = -0.76), and high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 172 min; Z = 1.62). These features are complemented by elevated intradaily variability in activity (IV = 0.73; Z = 1.30) and relatively weak 24‑hour autocorrelation of heart rate (0.22; Z = -0.87), which together indicate an irregular rest–activity/circadian profile that often co-occurs with poorer subjectively rated sleep.

Evidence pointing toward factors associated with higher (worse) PSQI: The participant’s habitual sleep onset is late (near 3:00 AM), and sleep timing is variable (sleep‑start SD ≈ 106 min; Z = 0.51). High night-to-night variability in duration (positive correlation with PSQI, r ≈ 0.21) and a non-trivial rate of daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.2; Z = 1.49) tend to fragment consolidated nocturnal sleep and are commonly associated with higher PSQI scores. Elevated perceived stress (PSS = 28; Z = 1.74) is another feature that typically predicts worse subjective sleep (PSS–PSQI correlation ≈ 0.2). Non-parametric circadian features (higher intradaily variability and reduced 24‑h autocorrelation) further indicate diminished regularity of physiological rhythms, a pattern that is plausibly linked to degraded sleep continuity and quality.

Evidence pointing toward factors associated with lower (better) PSQI: Several psychosocial and behavioral indicators would be expected to buffer against poor sleep. Depressive and trait‑anxiety symptom scores are low (CES‑D = 5, Z = -0.86; STAI = 35, Z = -0.62), self‑reported happiness and self‑esteem are relatively high (Happy Z = 1.64; Self‑Esteem Z = 0.82), and interpersonal trust is high (Z = 2.75). The participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use and only modest sedentary/leisure screen time; these lifestyle features are protective or neutral with respect to sleep quality. Physiologically, the aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate dipping (largest negative deviations between ~3–7 AM), which is consistent with periods of consolidated low arousal during the typical sleep window and suggests that when the participant is asleep, physiological sleep depth/parasympathetic dominance is present.

Physiological circadian summary and relative weighting: Parametric circadian features (MESOR ≈ 73 bpm, amplitude ≈ 10.6, acrophase ≈ 4:37 PM) are near the cohort mean and do not by themselves strongly predict poor or good sleep (correlations with PSQI are small). The stronger signals come from the non-parametric measures and the sleep timing/variability metrics: elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.30) and high sleep-duration variability (Z = 1.62) are the most salient objective markers that align with higher PSQI scores in this dataset. By contrast, the normative nocturnal heart‑rate dip and absence of mood disorder symptoms mitigate—but do not eliminate—the risk of elevated subjective sleep complaints.

Overall assessment relative to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the weight of objective sleep timing irregularity (late, inconsistent sleep onset), high variability in sleep duration, and elevated perceived stress leads to the inference that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI score (i.e., worse than average in this sample). Given the magnitude of the irregularity and variability (Z > 1 for several sleep‑timing and variability metrics) but the presence of protective psychosocial factors, the most parsimonious characterization is “moderately above the population mean” (greater sleep disturbance than typical in the cohort, though not extreme relative to the study distribution where mean PSQI = 6.73, SD = 2.16)."
28724,"Summary — overall pattern and comparison to the study sample:
Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics the participant shows several robust markers of adequate, regular nocturnal sleep (median nightly sleep 7 h 49 m; median sleep start ≈ 23:59; low night-to-night variability in sleep start time, SD ≈ 28 minutes; low mean daily napping). Psychological and lifestyle measures are generally protective (low depressive symptoms, moderate trait anxiety near sample mean, relatively high self-reported happiness and frequent exercise). Taken together, these features point toward sleep quality that is likely better than average in this sample. Relative to the study sample PSQI distribution (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the balance of evidence indicates the participant’s overall sleep quality is below the population mean (i.e., better sleep quality than the average study participant).

Features supporting lower PSQI (better sleep quality)
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity: Median sleep duration of 7 h 49 m (Z = +0.79) and a small standard deviation in both sleep duration (65 minutes; Z = -0.81) and sleep start time (28 minutes; Z = -1.22) indicate consistently sufficient sleep across the recording period. The low frequency of naps (mean ≈ 0.07/day) reduces the likelihood of fragmented or displaced nocturnal sleep.
- Subjective and behavioral protection: Low CES-D depressive symptom score (6; Z = -0.76) and relatively low perceived stress (PSS = 20; Z = -0.44), together with high self-reported happiness (Z = +1.64) and regular exercise (three times/week or more, Z = +1.07), are established correlates of better sleep. Low substance use (no beer, no recreational or non-prescribed drugs; modest wine use) and a healthy BMI (≈22.2) further support restorative sleep opportunity and sleep continuity.
- Nocturnal cardiovascular pattern consistent with sleep: Hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (e.g., −15 to −16 bpm between ~4–7 AM), consistent with consolidated sleep and nocturnal autonomic downregulation, which is generally associated with better subjective and objective sleep continuity.

Features supporting higher PSQI (worse sleep quality)
- Circadian regularity and fragmentation metrics: Several circadian summary metrics point to reduced day-to-day regularity or greater within-day fragmentation. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.32; Z = -0.74) and intradaily variability is relatively elevated (0.76; Z = +1.51). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.19; Z = -1.12). Lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability are commonly interpreted as weaker, more fragmented behavioral/cardiac rhythms and can be associated with worse sleep quality or irregular daytime routines.
- Blunted cosinor amplitude: The cosinor amplitude is modest (9.02; Z = -0.57), suggesting a smaller fitted day–night difference in heart rate rhythm than the sample average. A reduced amplitude can reflect either lower daytime activation or greater nocturnal arousal across days, both of which could negatively affect sleep consolidation for some people.
- Some daytime arousal patterning: Although nightly heart-rate dips are pronounced, there are very large midday rises (e.g., +20 bpm around 1–2 PM; Z = +2.10) and elevated values late morning–midday (11 AM–2 PM). Such peaks may reflect high daytime exertion or stressors that, depending on timing and recovery, could interfere with sleep onset or sleep continuity for some individuals.

Integration and interpretation of the circadian/physiological profile
The participant’s hourly heart-rate profile shows a clear day–night separation (deep nocturnal dips and substantial daytime peaks), which usually accompanies consolidated sleep. However, cosinor-derived metrics and non-parametric circadian measures give a slightly different signal: the fitted rhythm amplitude is modest and non-parametric indices show reduced interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability. This pattern suggests that while individual nights appear physiologically restful (deep nocturnal heart-rate reductions and objectively sufficient sleep duration), the daily pattern of activity and physiological arousal may be somewhat fragmented or variable across the recording period. Notably, the correlations of these specific circadian metrics with PSQI in the sample are small to modest (e.g., intradaily variability correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.01, interdaily stability ≈ -0.07), so their direct contribution to subjective sleep quality may be limited in this dataset; the stronger sleep-related signals here are the consistent sleep timing and adequate sleep duration.

Holistic conclusion
Balancing objective sleep duration and timing (both favorable), low psychological symptom burden, regular exercise and low substance use (protective) against circadian fragmentation indices (a potential risk factor), the preponderance of evidence supports relatively good sleep quality for this participant compared with the study sample. In plain terms: inferred sleep quality is below the population mean PSQI (i.e., better than average). The primary areas to monitor or investigate further would be the elevated intradaily variability and reduced interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms—if the participant reports sleep complaints despite the objectively good duration, those circadian fragmentation signals could help explain intermittent or day-to-day variability in perceived sleep quality."
69831,"Summary of wearable-physiological evidence suggesting relatively good sleep quality:
The participant’s objective nocturnal physiology and sleep quantity show several features that are typically associated with restorative sleep. Median nightly sleep duration was 8:00 hours (Z = +1.01), and mean daily naps were effectively zero (Z = −0.86), indicating that sleep opportunity at night is generally sufficient and that daytime napping is not substituting for nocturnal sleep. The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows a pronounced nocturnal fall in heart rate (largest deviations from the mesor between ~2:00–5:00 AM, e.g., −19.96 to −22.31 bpm), together with a relatively low resting heart rate (56 bpm, Z = −0.26). These features (clear night-time HR reduction and low resting HR) are consistent with consolidated sleep and cardiovascular recovery during sleep. Non‑parametric circadian rhythm metrics show relatively low intradaily variability (0.44, Z = −0.74) and only mildly reduced interdaily stability (0.38, Z = −0.24); lower intradaily variability usually indicates less fragmentation of activity across the 24‑hour day. Sleep start time variability is also low (SD = 35 minutes, Z = −1.05), indicating a consistent sleep timing pattern night‑to‑night despite a late clock time for sleep onset. Taken together, these wearable-derived signals point toward generally adequate sleep duration and consolidated nocturnal physiology.

Evidence pointing toward factors that may elevate PSQI (worse subjective sleep quality):
Several behavioral and subjective features could contribute to poorer perceived sleep quality despite objectively sufficient sleep duration. Median sleep start time is late (approximately 01:34:59), which can reflect circadian phase delay and is often associated with difficulty initiating sleep at socially-expected times and with daytime impairment. The participant reports high evening and leisure screen/media exposure (watching TV/videos 2–3 hours, internet use 3–4 hours, listening to music >4 hours; Z-scores +1.9–+2.1), behaviors that are modestly correlated with higher PSQI in the study sample and can impede sleep onset or increase sleep latency. Alcohol use (beer or wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ +0.9–1.0) may also degrade sleep continuity on nights of consumption. Subjective health satisfaction is low (score 2.67, Z = −1.2), and current self-reported happiness is below average (Z = −0.53); lower health satisfaction and affective well-being showed modest associations with worse PSQI in the sample and therefore could contribute to elevated perceived sleep problems. Finally, the participant’s very low BMI (15.6) is an outlying physical-health indicator that may relate to underlying medical or nutritional issues that could affect sleep, although no direct PSQI correlation for BMI is provided here.

Psychological/trait context and how it relates to sleep quality:
Trait and symptom measures overall do not indicate high psychiatric symptom burden in this participant, and these features weigh in favor of better sleep. Depressive symptom score (CES‑D = 10, Z = −0.34) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = −0.33) are below the study mean; both measures have positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), so the participant’s lower symptom levels predict lower PSQI (better sleep). Perceived stress is low (PSS = 16, Z = −1.53), another factor that aligns with lower reported sleep disturbance. Conversely, the participant reports very low frequencies of exercise (exercised alone and with others: “Not at all”, Z ≈ −1.9 and −1.6), and lower physical activity can be associated with worse sleep in some samples; in this dataset exercise correlations are small but the profile is notable. High levels of evening social/leisure engagement (socializing >4 hours, Z = +2.53) could either be protective or disruptive depending on timing; given the late sleep onset, these activities likely occur in the evening and may contribute to the delayed sleep schedule.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population:
Weighing objective physiological measures, behavioral patterns, and self-report measures produces a mixed but overall modestly favorable picture. Objective markers — adequate median sleep duration (8 hours), low nocturnal heart rate with a clear night‑day contrast, low intradaily variability, and consistent sleep timing night-to-night — all point toward relatively preserved sleep consolidation and recovery. Countervailing features that may increase subjective sleep complaints include a late habitual sleep onset (~01:35 AM), substantial evening screen/media exposure and music listening, some alcohol use, and lower self-rated health and happiness. Psychological symptom scores (depression, anxiety, perceived stress) are below the sample mean and therefore are likely to reduce the probability of high reported sleep disturbance.

Relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD 2.16), the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely at or slightly better than the sample mean (i.e., inferred PSQI somewhat below the population mean, indicating somewhat better-than-average sleep). This is a cautious inference: objective physiology and sufficient sleep duration favor a lower PSQI, while late sleep timing and evening behaviors could raise subjective complaints. The combined evidence therefore supports a modestly favorable sleep profile relative to the study cohort, with the caveat that late sleep timing and evening habits are actionable targets should subjective sleep problems emerge.

Limitations and practical considerations:
This inference is constrained by the absence of the participant’s direct PSQI score in the provided data and by reliance on cross-sectional correlations from the sample (which are modest for many features). If clinical or research decisions depend on subjective sleep quality, collecting the participant’s actual PSQI and a brief sleep‑diary or timing of evening activities would refine the assessment. Interventions that could further improve sleep quality (if desired) include shifting evening timing of stimulating media and social activities earlier, introducing regular daytime exercise, and monitoring alcohol timing relative to bedtime."
44927,"Summary of available data and analytic approach: The synthesis below integrates self-report trait and behavior measures with wearable-derived sleep and heart-rate circadian metrics collected across an academic semester. Where relevant I note the participant’s position relative to the study sample (Z-scores) and the direction of relationships between each metric and PSQI in the study sample; correlations are used only to inform interpretation, not to override the multimodal pattern.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 34 minutes (Z = -0.77), which is below commonly recommended sleep duration and below the study population mean; shorter habitual sleep is a common contributor to higher PSQI scores. The median sleep start time is late (about 00:59), indicating a delayed sleep schedule that can increase sleep latency, reduce total sleep opportunity relative to early-morning obligations, and is frequently associated with worse subjective sleep quality. Circadian amplitude derived from heart rate is comparatively low (amplitude = 9.58, Z = -0.39), and lower amplitude of diurnal heart-rate variation may reflect a blunted day–night physiological contrast; within the sample, amplitude had a modest negative correlation with PSQI (higher amplitude associated with lower PSQI), so a relatively low amplitude here points toward risk for worse sleep. Psychological and affective features provide modest additional risk: trait anxiety is near the sample mean (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13) and perceived stress is slightly above average (PSS = 22, Z = 0.10); both constructs are positively correlated with PSQI in the sample and can contribute to disturbed sleep when present. Finally, although sleep timing variability is not extreme, the standard deviation of sleep start time is roughly 94 minutes (Z = 0.23), indicating some night-to-night variability in bedtimes that can impair sleep consolidation for some individuals.

Evidence pointing toward relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Several behavioral and physiological features are protective. The participant reports no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use (large negative Z-scores for substance use), and naps are rare (mean daily naps 0.07, Z ≈ 0), both of which reduce common behavioral disruptors of nocturnal sleep. Sports frequency is high (three times per week or more; Z = 1.58), and resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42), together suggesting good cardiorespiratory fitness; greater habitual physical activity and lower resting heart rate are typically associated with better sleep quality and fewer sleep complaints. Objective night-time heart-rate deviations show clear nocturnal reductions (hourly deviations from mesor are strongly negative across the typical sleep window, e.g., -13 to -22 beats/hr from ~1–6 AM), which is physiologically consistent with consolidated sleep and nighttime autonomic downregulation. The participant’s sleep duration standard deviation is comparatively low (66 minutes, Z = -0.79), indicating relatively consistent night-to-night sleep length (consistent insufficient sleep is different from highly irregular sleep but is more predictable), and low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) further reduce risk of sleep fragmentation attributable to mood.

Circadian and hourly heart-rate profile (integrative interpretation): Circadian summary metrics show modestly reduced regularity and amplitude (interdaily stability 0.39, Z = -0.16; amplitude Z = -0.39) but intact 24-hour autocorrelation (autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 0.48) and a typical acrophase (~3:34 PM). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations indicate a robust nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~1–6 AM) and a pronounced morning elevation by 7–9 AM (7–10 AM hours show some of the largest positive deviations, with 7–8 AM notably high, Z = 1.9). These patterns are consistent with a reasonably entrained sleep–wake cycle and a clear sleep-related decline in physiological arousal, but the overall blunted amplitude suggests the day–night contrast is less marked than many peers—this mixed pattern is consistent with physiologic markers of generally consolidated but relatively short sleep.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Weighing the evidence, there are both protective and risk features. The strongest risk signals for poorer subjective sleep are the habitually short median sleep duration (~6.5 hours), the late median sleep onset (~1:00 AM), and reduced circadian amplitude in heart-rate rhythms. The strongest protective signals are the absence of substance use, infrequent napping, frequent sports participation, low resting heart rate, low depressive symptoms, and relatively consistent sleep duration night-to-night. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s sleep quality is likely modestly worse than average in this sample but not extremely poor. Relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the integrated profile is best characterized as mildly above the population mean (i.e., somewhat worse sleep quality than the average participant), rather than near the best or worst extremes. This conclusion reflects consistent short sleep and blunted circadian amplitude as primary contributors to higher PSQI risk, partially offset by healthful behaviors and generally low depressive symptomatology."
71894,"Psychological and self-report indicators point to multiple factors that are likely to contribute to poorer subjective sleep quality. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 34, Z = 2.15) and trait anxiety (STAI = 64, Z = 2.24); both scores have substantial positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (r ≈ 0.50 and r ≈ 0.41, respectively), indicating these mood symptoms are strongly linked to worse sleep in this cohort. Low self‑esteem (RSES = 19, Z = −2.7), low current happiness (score = 2.0, Z = −1.61), and low health satisfaction (score = 1.67, Z = −1.95) further reflect negative affect and health perceptions that, in this study, associate modestly with higher PSQI (self‑esteem r ≈ −0.36; happiness r ≈ −0.27; health satisfaction r ≈ −0.22). Behavioral habits that could exacerbate sleep complaints include high evening/overall screen and media exposure (internet use and listening to music both Z ≈ +2.0), which show small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample. Body mass index (BMI = 28.27) is above the population mean and may be relevant to sleep-related complaints, and variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep‑start SD ≈ 58 minutes, duration SD ≈ 54 minutes) — while not extreme — are associated with modest increases in PSQI in the sample (duration SD r ≈ 0.20; start‑time SD r ≈ 0.18). Collectively, these self‑report and behavioral indicators constitute a set of psychosocial risks that, based on the cohort correlations, would tend to increase the participant’s PSQI score.

Wearable-derived physiological and behavioral features show a mixed but partially protective pattern for sleep consolidation and circadian regularity. Nightly objective sleep is slightly shorter than the sample mean (median sleep duration 6 h 43 m; Z = −0.58), but naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = −0.86), which reduces fragmentation and sleep opportunity misalignment. Circadian summary metrics indicate moderate-to-good day-to-day regularity: interdaily stability = 0.47 (Z ≈ 0.5) and autocorrelation at 24 hours = 0.50 (Z ≈ 1.48), both consistent with a reliably entrained rhythm across recording days. The hourly heart‑rate profile shows a pronounced nocturnal trough (mean deviations −15 to −24 bpm relative to the mesor between ~12:00–6:00 AM) and a robust morning rise (notably large positive deviations at 6–8 AM, Z ≈ 4.4–4.6), implying consolidated nighttime physiological quiescence and a strong, temporally consistent wake activation. Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly above average (resting HR = 63.6, mesor ≈ 80.9; Z ≈ 0.65–0.95) but do not by themselves indicate poor sleep. Amplitude of the fitted circadian rhythm is somewhat lower than the sample mean (amplitude = 8.47, Z = −0.75), which can reflect a mildly blunted daily rhythm; however, amplitude correlates only weakly with PSQI in the cohort (r ≈ −0.11). Overall, wearable data provide evidence of a reasonably stable and consolidated circadian/physiological pattern that would tend to support better objective sleep continuity.

Integrating self-report and wearable evidence yields a nuanced picture. Psychosocial and behavioral risk factors—marked depressive and anxious symptom burden, low self‑esteem and happiness, high evening screen/media time, and modestly shortened sleep duration—are the most salient indicators pointing toward elevated subjective sleep disturbance (and these measures also show the strongest cohort correlations with PSQI). In contrast, objective wearable features—minimal napping, clear nocturnal heart‑rate suppression, a strong and consistent morning physiological activation, and above‑average interdaily rhythm stability—argue for regular sleep–wake timing and consolidated nocturnal physiology, factors that typically support lower PSQI scores. The competing signals suggest the participant may experience objectively consolidated nighttime sleep but subjectively perceive poorer sleep quality, driven primarily by mood/anxiety and lifestyle factors.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: considering the strong positive associations between the participant’s high depressive and anxiety scores and PSQI, combined with the participant’s slightly shortened sleep duration and high evening media use, the balance of evidence points to an overall sleep quality that is likely above the population mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average). The study population mean PSQI was 6.73 (SD = 2.16); although wearable circadian measures show strengths that could mitigate some sleep problems, the magnitude of the participant’s psychosocial risk factors makes it more likely that their subjective sleep complaints and overall PSQI would fall above the sample mean rather than at or below it."
30453,"Summary and overall comparison:
Across the available measures, the participant’s profile indicates sleep quality that is likely worse than the study sample average — i.e., above the population mean PSQI (population mean PSQI = 6.7). This inference is driven primarily by elevated self-reported affective symptoms (CES-D = 31, Z = 1.84; STAI = 51, Z = 0.96), objective markers of circadian irregularity and physiological arousal (reduced interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, higher-than-average resting heart rate), and short, variable nocturnal sleep (median duration 6 h 25 min, Z = -0.96; duration SD = 145 minutes, Z = 1.0; median sleep onset 01:21). The strongest single survey correlates with PSQI in this case are depressive symptoms (CES-D, r ≈ 0.49) and trait anxiety (STAI, r ≈ 0.40), which supports the interpretation that psychological distress is a major contributor to poorer sleep in this participant.

Evidence indicating factors associated with poorer sleep:
Several convergent indicators point toward risk for elevated PSQI. High depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 31, Z = 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 51, Z = 0.96) have the largest positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset and are known drivers of sleep disturbance; both are elevated for this participant. Physiologically, circadian rhythm metrics show reduced regularity and amplitude — interdaily stability = 0.30 (Z = -0.9) and amplitude = 8.82 (Z = -0.63) — and intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.63, Z = 0.6). Those non-parametric features indicate fragmented and less-stable daily heart-rate rhythms, which is consistent with poorer sleep consolidation and higher PSQI in group-level analyses. Resting heart rate is relatively high (67.5 bpm, Z = 1.11), and several nocturnal hourly heart-rate deviations during the early-morning window (roughly 1–5 AM) have small positive correlations with PSQI, suggesting that nocturnal autonomic patterns accompany self-reported poor sleep. Behaviorally, the participant’s typical sleep schedule is late (median sleep start ~01:21) and variable across nights (start-time SD ≈ 95 minutes), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is large (SD 145 minutes), both of which are associated with worse subjective sleep quality in this sample (sleep variability correlations ~0.18–0.19).

Evidence indicating factors associated with better sleep:
There are several protective or neutral indicators that could mitigate aspects of sleep disturbance. The participant reports no use of alcohol, recreational drugs, or non-prescribed drugs (all “not at all”; Z-scores substantially below cohort means), which reduces the likelihood of substance-related sleep disruption. Physical activity is relatively frequent (team/organized exercise and sports reported three times per week or more; sports Z = 1.58, exercised with others Z = 1.23), and exercise measures in this dataset show small negative correlations with PSQI, suggesting some protective effect. The participant reports essentially no daily naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), which can help maintain nocturnal sleep pressure. Finally, although median sleep duration (6 h 25 min) is below a typical recommendation, it is not extremely short and therefore only partially offsets other risks.

Integrated interpretation and relative weighting:
Balancing the evidence, the most salient drivers pointing to poorer sleep are (1) substantial depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety (both strongly correlated with PSQI), (2) circadian irregularity and fragmentation (low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, elevated intradaily variability), and (3) late, inconsistent bedtimes with high night-to-night variability in sleep duration. Protective behaviors (regular exercise, absence of alcohol/drug use, and minimal napping) likely exert some favorable influence but appear insufficient to offset the combined psychological and circadian/behavioral risks. Physiological data (elevated resting HR and nocturnal heart-rate patterns) provide convergent objective support for increased arousal and disrupted sleep physiology. Taken together, these patterns support an inference that the participant’s overall sleep quality is above (worse than) the study population mean PSQI, with psychological distress and circadian instability the primary contributors and exercise and absence of substance use partial mitigating factors.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation:
Correlations between many objective features and PSQI are modest, and the hourly heart-rate deviations are aggregated across days (limiting causal/temporal interpretation). Thus, while the combined pattern strongly suggests sleep quality poorer than the sample average, the inference is probabilistic rather than definitive. The data emphasize targets (affective symptoms, sleep timing variability, and circadian regularity) that most clearly differentiate this participant from peers in ways that relate to higher PSQI."
66047,"Summary comparison to study sample
Based on the combined self-report and wearable data, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a PSQI score that is above the study sample mean (population mean PSQI = 6.71). The inference rests primarily on large symptom burdens (depression and trait anxiety), pronounced late sleep timing and night-to-night instability, and physiologic signs of evening/night arousal; these factors have established positive associations with higher PSQI in the sample and collectively outweigh indicators of intact sleep quantity.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality (factors supporting a higher PSQI)
- High affective symptom burden: The participant’s CES‑D score (46; Z = 3.4) and STAI‑Trait score (73; Z = 3.13) are extreme relative to the sample and correlate positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.39, respectively). These are among the strongest single predictors in the dataset and are commonly linked to difficulties with sleep initiation, maintenance, and restorative sleep.  
- Late and irregular sleep timing: The median sleep start time is very late (≈ 02:40 AM) with nontrivial night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 84 minutes). Later habitual sleep onset and timing variability are associated with worse subjective sleep quality in this sample and increase the likelihood of misalignment between sleep timing and daytime demands.  
- Fragmentation and variability in sleep patterns: Sleep duration median is within a normal range, but sleep duration SD is large (≈106 minutes; Z ≈ 0.12) and mean daily naps are elevated (0.28 naps/day; Z = 2.4). Higher variability and more frequent napping are positively correlated with PSQI (duration SD r ≈ 0.20; naps r ≈ 0.16) and suggest inconsistent sleep consolidation.  
- Physiological indicators of evening/night arousal and reduced circadian amplitude: Resting heart rate is higher than average (68.4 bpm; Z = 1.22). The circadian amplitude of heart rate is relatively reduced (amplitude Z ≈ −0.31), intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.58; Z ≈ 0.24), and the aggregated hourly HR deviations show relative elevation around late evening/midnight hours (e.g., 12–1am: +5.8 bpm). These findings are consistent with greater nocturnal physiological activation and weaker circadian signal, both of which are linked to worse subjective sleep quality in the sample.

Evidence pointing toward relatively better sleep quality (factors supporting a lower PSQI)
- Adequate median sleep duration: Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 15 minutes (Z ≈ 0.08), which is within a typical restorative range and has only a small positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.05). This suggests total sleep time per se is not the primary driver of worse subjective sleep here.  
- Low substance use: The participant reports minimal alcohol and no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use (Z‑scores below the sample mean), which reduces risk for substance‑related sleep disruption.  
- Some preserved day‑to‑day regularity: Interdaily stability is modest (0.43; Z ≈ 0.17) rather than markedly low, indicating that overall day‑to‑day timing of activity is not highly disorganized; this provides a modest counterbalance to the late timing and variability noted above.

Synthesis and interpretation
Weighing the evidence, the data point toward a sleep profile likely worse than the study sample average (i.e., a PSQI above 6.71). The strongest contributors to that inference are the very elevated depressive and trait anxiety symptoms (largest correlations with PSQI) together with late habitual sleep onset, substantial night‑to‑night variability, increased napping, and physiologic signs of evening/nighttime arousal and reduced circadian amplitude. These features are consistent with subjectively poorer sleep quality despite an adequate median duration. The presence of low substance use and a median total sleep time near 7+ hours temper the inferred severity but do not outweigh the combined psychosocial and physiological indicators linked to higher PSQI."
79834,"Summary of available data: The participant’s profile combines favorable physiological markers (low resting heart rate, clear nocturnal heart-rate decline, moderate circadian amplitude) with behavioral and lifestyle features that are mixed with respect to sleep risk. Key numeric anchors are a median wearable-derived sleep duration of 8 hours 18 minutes (Z = +1.39), a median sleep start time near 00:46 (SD ~52 minutes, relatively stable, Z = -0.68), no recorded naps, a low resting heart rate (52.9 bpm, Z = -0.62), circadian amplitude that is modestly above average (amplitude = 12.5, Z = +0.56) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈17:23). Self-report symptom scores for depressive and anxiety symptoms are below the study mean (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55; STAI Trait = 37, Z = -0.43) and perceived stress is also below the mean (PSS = 19, Z = -0.71). Several of the study metrics have nontrivial correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40), which guides interpretation where relevant.

Evidence consistent with higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): Several behavioral features and circadian pattern elements could act to increase PSQI. The participant’s sleep timing is relatively late (median start ~00:46), which in many samples is associated with greater subjective sleep complaints; within the dataset, delayed or variable sleep timing tends to correlate positively with worse PSQI. Alcohol use is notable: self-reported use of wine or liquor “three times a week or more” (Z = +1.68) is a plausible contributor to fragmented or lower-quality sleep on drinking nights, and alcohol consumption in the sample is weakly positively associated with PSQI. Interdaily stability from heart-rate rhythms is somewhat low (0.37, Z = -0.33), indicating less day‑to‑day consistency in circadian timing; inconsistent schedules are a known risk factor for poorer sleep. Hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively large evening elevations (e.g., 6–7pm and 9–10pm have large positive deviations, Zs up to ≈+1.6), which could reflect evening arousal or activity that may impede sleep onset for some people. Finally, although depressive and anxiety scores are below the study mean, the CES-D and STAI have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (r = 0.49 and r = 0.40, respectively), so even modest symptom levels can contribute to worse subjective sleep for some participants.

Evidence consistent with lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Several objective and subjective indicators point toward relatively good sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is well above the study mean (8h 18m; Z = +1.39) and the participant reports virtually no naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), both of which are associated with greater restorative sleep opportunity and typically lower PSQI. Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is relatively low (sleep start SD ≈52 minutes, Z = -0.68; duration SD 85 minutes, Z = -0.35), suggesting a consistent sleep schedule that protects sleep quality. Wearable-derived physiology supports consolidation: a clear nocturnal fall in heart rate through the early morning hours and a modest-to-strong circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = +0.56; 24‑hour autocorrelation Z = +0.64) indicate preserved circadian structure and a pronounced sleep-related cardiovascular downshift, features often associated with better objective sleep. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.9 bpm, Z = -0.62), which may reflect higher cardiorespiratory fitness and is generally linked to better sleep health. Self-reported affective measures (low depressive and anxiety scores, below-mean perceived stress, and above-average health satisfaction) further favor lower PSQI, given their negative associations with sleep disturbance in the sample.

Holistic comparison to the study population mean PSQI and interpretation: Balancing the pieces, the participant shows more evidence of favorable sleep health than of marked sleep disturbance. The most salient protective signals are the long median sleep duration, low nap use, relatively low variability, objective nocturnal heart-rate decline, modestly strong circadian amplitude and autocorrelation, low resting heart rate, and below-average depression/anxiety/stress. Risk signals — later sleep timing, frequent wine/liquor use, somewhat lower interdaily stability, and evening heart-rate elevations — are present but more circumscribed. Taken together, these indicators suggest the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely better than the average study participant (i.e., the inferred PSQI is below the population mean of 6.73), though not extremely lower; there are identifiable behaviors (notably evening alcohol use and late bedtimes) that could elevate PSQI on specific nights. This assessment reflects aggregated wearable physiology and current self-report and should be interpreted as probabilistic rather than diagnostic."
33133,"Indicators in this dataset that are most consistent with relatively poor sleep quality center on psychological distress, circadian fragility, and somewhat shortened sleep opportunity. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 31, Z = 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76); both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40 respectively), making them strong risk markers for higher PSQI. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65; PSQI correlation ≈ 0.20), and self-reported happiness and trust are below average (happiness Z = -0.53; trust Z = -0.78), which map onto the same pattern of psychological vulnerability that tends to accompany worse subjective sleep. Objective/wearable-derived circadian features show modest signs of reduced circadian robustness: amplitude is slightly below the study mean (amplitude = 10.11, Z = -0.22) and intradaily variability is above average (IV = 0.63, Z = 0.60), a combination that is commonly associated with more fragmented activity/rest structure and with higher sleep complaints. Sleep timing evidence is also mixed in ways that could increase sleep disturbance risk: median sleep start is late (00:40) with moderately high night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD = 101 minutes, Z = 0.39; PSQI correlation ≈ 0.18). Median nightly sleep duration is under 7 hours (6 h 38 m, Z = -0.68), which—together with the psychological risk factors—leans toward a higher PSQI score.

Evidence that points toward relatively better sleep quality is present but less prominent. The wearable heart-rate pattern shows a clear nocturnal decline in mean heart rate across the typical sleep window (large negative deviations from mesor between ~1–6 AM), consistent with expected nocturnal physiological downregulation and at least some intact sleep physiology. Resting heart rate is in the healthy range (58.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.05), and overall circadian stability (interdaily stability = 0.40, Z = -0.08) is near the study average rather than markedly disrupted. Behavioral factors that are typically protective include regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week, Z = 1.07) and low use of recreational/non-prescribed drugs; mean daily naps are minimal (0.09 naps/day). Night-to-night variability in total sleep duration is relatively low compared with the sample (sleep duration SD = 63 minutes, Z = -0.85), which can reduce subjective sleep variability complaints even if the absolute duration is slightly short.

Weighing the evidence, the balance favors an inference of worse-than-average sleep quality in this participant. High depressive symptom burden and elevated anxiety—two of the strongest correlates of PSQI in this sample—together with shortened median sleep duration and signs of increased intradaily variability and delayed/more variable sleep timing, suggest a PSQI above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.71). Protective elements (clear nocturnal HR decline, healthy resting HR, regular exercise, low substance use, and relatively stable total-duration night-to-night variability) mitigate but do not outweigh the psychological and circadian risk indicators. Therefore, the overall pattern is most consistent with sleep quality that is above the population mean (i.e., poorer than average within this sample).

Limitations and uncertainty: this conclusion is inferential because a direct PSQI score for the participant is not provided here; population-level correlations are probabilistic and do not determine individual outcomes. Physiological metrics are aggregated summaries and do not replace night-by-night sleep staging or a direct PSQI report. The strongest drivers of the inference are the high depression and anxiety scores, which are robustly associated with worse subjective sleep in this sample; if treatment or changes reduce these symptoms, the participant’s sleep quality could improve even if some circadian markers remain attenuated."
47810,"Indicators pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality for this participant center on behavioral timing, sleep amount, daytime sleepiness/napping, and affective symptoms. The median sleep start time is late (01:26 AM), and median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 40 minutes (Z = -0.65), both of which typically reduce sleep opportunity and are commonly associated with higher PSQI scores. The participant also shows an elevated rate of daytime napping (mean daily naps 0.27, Z = 2.34), and naps in this sample correlate positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.16), suggesting that daytime sleep may be compensatory for truncated or fragmented nocturnal sleep and may be contributing to subjective sleep problems. On the self-report side, depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 15, near the clinical cutoff and Z = 0.18) has the strongest positive correlation with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.49); lower reported happiness and reduced health satisfaction (Z-scores −0.53 and −0.7, respectively) further align with factors that commonly co-occur with poorer sleep. Finally, the wearable-derived intradaily variability (IV = 0.83, Z = 2.01) is high, indicating frequent transitions between rest and activity states within days — a pattern consistent with fragmented circadian organization and, in many contexts, worse subjective sleep quality.

Conversely, several physiological and lifestyle features point toward preserved aspects of sleep health that would mitigate the magnitude of PSQI elevation. Nocturnal cardiovascular dynamics show a marked nocturnal decline in heart rate (largest negative deviations from the mesor occur between ~2:00–6:00 AM, with the deepest dips around 4–6 AM, Zs ≈ −0.7 to −1.1), indicating intact nocturnal parasympathetic dominance and an observable sleep-related heart rate nadir; such physiological “dipping” is associated with consolidated sleep and better restorative physiology. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.3 bpm, Z = −0.22), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness, which is generally protective for sleep. Exercise frequency is present (exercising 1–2 times per week, Zs ~0.3–0.9), alcohol and other substance use are low (only wine 1–2 times/week is elevated; beer and drugs largely absent), and sleep start time variability (SD = 65 minutes, Z = −0.40) is not highly elevated — together these patterns suggest some stable routines and healthy behaviors that can support sleep quality.

Circadian-rhythm summary measures show a mixed pattern. Mesor and amplitude are modestly above average (Mesor ~75.2 bpm, Z = 0.17; amplitude ~12.4, Z = 0.52) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:46 PM), which is a typical daytime peak. Interdaily stability (IS = 0.40, Z ≈ −0.08) is near the sample mean, indicating reasonable day-to-day timing consistency, but the low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.21, Z ≈ −0.95) together with the high intradaily variability suggests that while average daily timing is not extremely disrupted, within-day fragmentation of activity/rest is pronounced. Importantly, in this sample IV has little bivariate correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.0), so the high IV should be interpreted as physiological evidence of irregular within-day rest–activity switching rather than a proven direct predictor of subjective sleep complaints here; however, it plausibly amplifies the effects of late bedtime and short sleep opportunity.

Integrating these data, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s sleep quality is likely somewhat worse than the study population average. Key drivers pushing toward a higher PSQI are the late habitual bedtime, sleep duration below seven hours, elevated naps, high intradaily variability, and the presence of subthreshold depressive symptoms (the strongest single correlate of PSQI in this dataset). Offsetting factors that argue against a large PSQI elevation include preserved nocturnal heart-rate dipping, low resting heart rate, some regularity in sleep timing, modest exercise, and low overall substance use. Given the mix of risk and protective signals, the most appropriate summary is that this participant’s inferred sleep quality is probably above the population mean PSQI (i.e., poorer sleep than average in this sample), but not extreme; the data are consistent with a modest-to-moderate elevation in PSQI rather than a severe outlier.

If a next-step focus is desirable, the data indicate that interventions or behavior changes most likely to improve subjective sleep quality would target earlier and more consistent sleep timing, reduction or strategic elimination of daytime napping, and psychosocial supports aimed at mood and daytime well-being, all while preserving the beneficial habits already present (regular exercise, low substance use)."
58196,"Indicators that would be expected to increase the participant’s PSQI score (worse sleep quality) are several and relatively coherent. Wearable-recorded sleep behaviour shows a median nightly duration of 6 hours 33 minutes (Z = -0.79), with a late median sleep onset near 01:02 AM and nontrivial night-to-night variability in both duration (SD = 82 minutes) and start time (SD = 72 minutes). Napping is present (mean 0.15 naps/day; Z = 0.94), and alcohol use at 1–2 times per week is above the sample mean (Z ≈ 1.0) — each of these behaviors has small positive correlations with PSQI in this sample. Circadian/actigraphy-derived rhythm metrics point toward reduced regularity and greater fragmentation: interdaily stability is below average (0.34, Z = -0.57) and intradaily variability is above average (0.66, Z = 0.81). Amplitude from heart-rate cosinor analysis is also below the study mean (8.84, Z = -0.63). Taken together, the late bedtimes, shortened median sleep duration, some daytime napping, and evidence of weakened and less-stable circadian structure are consistent with factors that typically elevate PSQI scores.

At the same time, several psychological and physiological features are likely to protect against very poor subjective sleep. Self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms are low (CES‑D = 6, Z = -0.76; STAI = 31, Z = -1.02), and happiness (Z = 1.64) and self‑esteem (Z = 1.10) are relatively high; CES‑D and these positive affect/self‑concept metrics show moderate correlations with PSQI in the expected directions (e.g., CES‑D correlation with PSQI = 0.49; self‑esteem correlation = -0.35). The participant reports frequent exercise (three+ times per week, Z > 1), a healthy BMI (23.2), high health satisfaction (Z = 1.38), and minimal recreational drug use — all behaviors that tend to associate with better sleep. Resting cardiovascular indices are also consistent with good baseline physiology: resting heart rate is low (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56) and the nocturnal heart-rate trough is pronounced (overnight hourly deviations reaching roughly -16 to -18 bpm relative to mesor), which suggests preserved nocturnal cardiovascular recovery that is typically associated with restorative sleep.

The circadian and hourly heart-rate profile provides a mixed but interpretable physiologic picture. The participant shows a clear daytime heart-rate elevation with an acrophase in mid‑afternoon (3:36 PM) and large daytime deviations (afternoon peaks up to +14 bpm), indicating intact diurnal activity. However, the overall cosinor amplitude and interdaily stability are below the group mean while intradaily variability is elevated; this pattern implies that while the participant’s daily physiology has a recognizable day–night swing and nightly recovery, the amplitude and regularity of that rhythm are blunted and somewhat fragmented across days. From a sleep-quality perspective this combination often corresponds to a physiologically restorative night-to-night pattern that is nevertheless vulnerable to behavioral irregularities (late bedtimes, naps) that degrade subjective sleep quality.

Integrating these domains, the evidence supports a balanced conclusion: the participant has several protective psychological and physiological attributes that mitigate severe sleep impairment, but concurrent behavioral and circadian irregularities that are known to increase subjective sleep complaints. Relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the overall pattern is most consistent with a PSQI score moderately above the population mean (i.e., worse-than-average sleep quality), rather than substantially better-than-average or extremely poor sleep. In short, objective physiology and positive affective profile argue for moderate resilience, but late and somewhat irregular sleep timing combined with reduced circadian stability point toward a modestly elevated PSQI compared with peers."
62246,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable measures the participant shows a profile more consistent with good sleep quality than poor. Objective sleep duration is adequate (median 7 h 39 min; Z = +0.59) with low day-to-day variability in duration (SD = 65 minutes; Z = −0.82) and essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0; Z = −0.86). Circadian/actigraphy-derived rhythm metrics indicate a relatively regular and consolidated pattern: interdaily stability is slightly above the sample mean (0.44; Z = +0.25) and intradaily variability is markedly below the sample mean (0.32; Z = −1.59), suggesting low fragmentation of the 24-hour heart-rate rhythm. Trait-level psychological risk markers that commonly co-vary with poor sleep (depressive and anxiety symptoms) are low (CES-D = 4, Z ≈ −0.97; STAI-trait = 33, Z ≈ −0.82), and the participant reports frequent exercise (exercised alone three or more times per week; Z = +1.07), which is also associated with better sleep in this sample. Taken together, these patterns point toward a sleep profile that is likely to produce a lower (better) PSQI score than the study population average.

Evidence pointing toward relatively low PSQI (better sleep): 
- Sufficient and stable nocturnal duration (median 7h39; moderate positive Z), low variability in sleep duration (SD Z = −0.82) and minimal napping (Z = −0.86) are all direct behavioral indicators associated with better subjective sleep quality. 
- Circadian rhythm structure (low intradaily variability, modestly higher interdaily stability, reasonable amplitude and mesor) supports consolidated night-time physiology and lower fragmentation, which typically align with lower PSQI. 
- Low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D and STAI both well below the sample mean) reduce a major psychosocial risk factor for poor sleep (CES-D correlates with PSQI in this sample at r ≈ 0.49). 
- Frequent exercise and higher self-rated health satisfaction (health satisfaction Z = +0.63) are additional protective factors against poor sleep in this dataset.

Evidence pointing toward relatively high PSQI (poorer sleep): 
- Bedtime is near midnight (median sleep start ~23:56) which is somewhat later than more conservative sleep schedules; while not extreme, later sleep onset can be associated with some sleep complaints in certain populations. 
- Alcohol consumption at the weekly level (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ +1.0) is a modest risk factor—associations with PSQI in this sample are small but in the expected direction. 
- Some hourly heart-rate deviations during the early night hours show weak positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., correlations around 0.1–0.2 for very early-morning hours); these effects are small and temporally aggregated, so they should be interpreted cautiously rather than taken as strong evidence of physiological arousal at night. 
- Perceived stress is near the sample mean (PSS = 21; Z ≈ −0.17), so stress does not strongly protect against or confer risk for poor sleep in this individual's profile but is not a clear buffer.

Physiological circadian profile and heart-rate aggregation: The participant’s heart-rate cosinor parameters show a modestly elevated mesor and amplitude (mesor Z = +0.56; amplitude Z = +0.47) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:23 PM). The aggregated hourly deviations show the expected pronounced nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations −20 to −23 bpm between ~2–7 AM) and a daytime rise beginning in the morning. Low intradaily variability and reasonable interdaily stability indicate a strong, consistent circadian signal across days. These physiological features support consolidated nocturnal physiology and are therefore consistent with better subjective sleep quality.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to population PSQI: Weighing the objective sleep metrics, circadian stability, low psychological symptom burden, and health behaviors, the overall evidence favors relatively good sleep quality. Relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with a PSQI score below the population mean (i.e., better-than-average sleep quality). This conclusion is supported by multiple moderate-to-strong protective signals (adequate, stable sleep duration; low intradaily variability; low depressive/anxiety symptoms) despite modest risk factors (weekly alcohol use, bedtime near midnight). The net balance of evidence suggests the participant would be expected to report lower PSQI scores than the study average, rather than above it."
55424,"Summary — overall pattern:
The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of objective sleep regularity and physiological circadian robustness alongside substantial self-reported affective symptom burden. Wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 24 minutes (Z = +0.27) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 69 minutes, Z = −0.72) and a fairly consistent sleep start time (median 00:21, start-time SD = 58 minutes, Z = −0.54). Heart-rate–based circadian measures (interdaily stability = 0.42, Z = +0.09; intradaily variability = 0.48, Z = −0.46; amplitude = 11.82, Z = +0.34) and a clear nocturnal heart-rate trough (hourly deviations −20 to −12 bpm overnight) suggest an organized, consolidated physiological rhythm. In contrast, self-report data show markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 35, Z = +2.26) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 57, Z = +1.55), plus lower positive affect/happiness (current happiness = 2.0, Z = −1.61) and somewhat reduced self-esteem (RSES = 32, Z = −0.87). These psychological factors have moderate correlations with PSQI in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.48; STAI r ≈ 0.39), indicating they are relevant for interpreting likely sleep quality.

Features consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (likely to increase PSQI):
- High depressive and anxiety symptom scores: CES-D = 35 (Z = +2.26) and STAI = 57 (Z = +1.55). Both scales show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.48 and r ≈ 0.39), which supports an association between the participant’s affective symptom burden and greater subjective sleep complaints or disturbances. 
- Elevated napping frequency: mean daily naps ≈ 0.24 (Z = +1.90), indicating more frequent daytime naps relative to the sample. Even though the absolute value is less than one nap per day, the high Z-score suggests this participant naps substantially more than peers; daytime napping can reflect residual sleepiness or compensatory behavior associated with poorer nocturnal sleep quality and is positively correlated with PSQI in the dataset (r ≈ 0.14).
- Subjective low well-being: low self-reported happiness (Z = −1.61) and modestly lower self-esteem (Z = −0.87) are associated with worse PSQI in the sample (self-esteem r ≈ −0.35), and may contribute to increased perception of sleep problems or symptom-driven sleep disruption.

Features consistent with relatively better sleep quality (likely to decrease PSQI):
- Adequate and regular objective sleep duration: a median of 7 h 24 m (Z = +0.27) with below-average night-to-night variability (sleep SD Z = −0.72) and relatively stable bedtimes (start-time SD Z = −0.54) are objective markers typically associated with fewer sleep complaints and better subjective sleep quality. These wearable-derived metrics argue against severe chronic short sleep or marked irregularity.
- Consolidated circadian pattern and low fragmentation: interdaily stability near the sample mean (Z ≈ +0.09), lower intradaily variability (Z ≈ −0.46), a clear nocturnal heart-rate trough and a physiologic acrophase around mid-to-late afternoon (15:36) indicate a reasonably coherent circadian organization. Such circadian regularity usually supports sleep consolidation and lower PSQI.
- Resting heart rate and amplitude: a relatively low resting HR (57.6 bpm, Z ≈ −0.07) and modest amplitude (Z ≈ +0.34) are consistent with normal cardiovascular recovery overnight and intact day–night physiological contrast, which aligns with objective sleep sufficiency.

Synthesis and comparative conclusion:
Taken together, the objective wearable data (adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, consolidated circadian rhythm) point toward generally sufficient and regular nocturnal sleep, which would tend to predict a relatively lower PSQI score. However, the participant’s markedly elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety—both moderately correlated with PSQI in the sample—along with relatively frequent daytime napping and low self-reported happiness, present countervailing evidence that subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning may be worse than implied by the wearables alone. On balance, given the large magnitude of affective symptom elevation (CES-D Z ≈ +2.26) and its relatively strong association with PSQI in this cohort, the integrated evidence is most consistent with the participant having a PSQI above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.7). In other words, although objective nocturnal sleep quantity and circadian regularity are near or slightly better than average, the participant’s affective symptom burden and daytime sleep-related behavior (increased napping) make it likely their overall sleep quality and subjective sleep-related distress exceed that of the typical study participant.

Key implications for interpretation:
- Objective wearable measures suggest physiological capacity for consolidated sleep, but subjective distress and daytime compensatory behaviors are important determinants of perceived sleep quality and likely drive a higher PSQI. 
- If the goal is to reduce reported sleep impairment, addressing affective symptoms (depressive/anxiety) and daytime sleepiness/napping behavior may be especially relevant, even in the context of adequate nocturnal duration."
23576,"Summary: The multimodal data indicate a generally regular and physiologically coherent sleep-wake pattern with several behavioral and self-report features that are protective for sleep, alongside a few behavioral elements that could increase subjective sleep disturbance. Objective wearable metrics show a relatively long median nightly sleep duration (7 h 46 min; Z = 0.72) with low night-to-night variability (SD = 58 minutes; Z = -0.98) and a small variability in sleep start time (SD = 45 minutes; Z = -0.83). Circadian-derived heart rate measures indicate a reasonably stable rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.47, Z = 0.50; autocorrelation at 24 hours = 0.45, Z = 1.06) and a normal timing of peak cardiac activity (acrophase ~ 4:05 PM). Self-report trait and lifestyle measures (low depression and trait anxiety scores, high exercise frequency, minimal substance use) further support a profile that tends toward better sleep quality.

Factors consistent with relatively worse sleep (higher PSQI): The participant’s median sleep start time is fairly late (around 00:38), which can be associated with greater eveningness and potential misalignment with daytime demands; late bedtimes are commonly linked to higher PSQI scores. Self-reported evening leisure habits include above-average time watching TV/videos (Z = 1.28) and playing video games (Z = 1.71), which can contribute to pre-sleep cognitive or light exposure that interferes with sleep initiation or subjective sleep quality. Although the objective intradaily variability is only modest (0.58, Z = 0.24), any increased fragmentation in activity rhythms has been associated with worse PSQI in the literature (correlations in this sample are small but positive). Finally, the participant’s self-reported current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (Z = -0.53), and even low-to-moderate levels of perceived stress can modestly relate to higher PSQI; these psychosocial factors can influence subjective sleep disturbance even when objective sleep duration is adequate.

Factors consistent with relatively better sleep (lower PSQI): Objective indicators strongly favor good sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is longer than average (7 h 46 min, Z = 0.72) and night-to-night variability in duration is lower than average (SD Z = -0.98), both of which are among the stronger wearable predictors of better PSQI in this sample (sleep regularity shows positive correlations with better sleep). The participant reports virtually no naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), and no alcohol or recreational drug use, both of which reduce common sources of sleep disruption. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.6 bpm, Z = -0.07) and nocturnal hourly heart rate deviations show the expected substantial reduction during the night (largest negative deviations around 4–6 AM), consistent with consolidated nocturnal sleep and normal nocturnal autonomic downregulation. Trait-level measures are also favorable: low depressive symptoms (CES-D score = 7, Z = -0.66) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72) are both associated with lower PSQI risk in this sample (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49; STAI correlation = 0.40), so the participant’s low scores on these scales are protective.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSQI: When weighing the objective sleep duration and stability, robust circadian rhythm metrics, low substance use, regular exercise, and low depression/anxiety against the potential risks posed by a late habitual sleep onset and elevated evening screen time, the balance favors relatively good sleep quality. Accordingly, the participant’s overall sleep quality is best characterized as below the study population mean PSQI (i.e., better-than-average sleep). This conclusion is supported most strongly by objective duration and regularity metrics (high relative duration, low variability, and strong 24-hour autocorrelation) and by favorable mental-health and lifestyle indicators; however, the late bedtime and evening screen use represent modifiable risks that could increase subjective sleep disturbance and should be considered when interpreting PSQI-related outcomes."
93485,"Summary of sleep timing and quantity: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration of about 7 hours and 1 minute (Z ≈ -0.2), with a median sleep onset near 00:58. Night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 70 minutes, Z ≈ -0.69) and in sleep start time (SD ≈ 81 minutes, Z ≈ -0.05) are modest and slightly below or near the cohort average. Napping is effectively absent (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z ≈ -0.86). Taken together, these objective sleep metrics indicate that the participant generally obtains a typical amount of sleep for an undergraduate sample, with relatively little reliance on naps, and without extreme variability in duration across nights.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology: Heart-rate–based circadian features point to a well-structured daily rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47, Z = 1.23) are above the sample mean, and cosinor amplitude is markedly high (16.65, Z = 1.9), indicating strong day–night differentiation in cardiovascular tone. The acrophase around 4:00 PM and daytime aggregate heart-rate elevations (largest deviations midday–afternoon) paired with pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions (largest negative deviations between ~1–6 AM) are consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and daytime activity. Resting heart rate is unusually low (47.3 bpm, Z = -1.29), which commonly reflects good cardiovascular fitness and generally lower physiological arousal at rest. In sum, the wearable physiology signals a robust, regular circadian pattern and strong nocturnal cardiovascular down-regulation, both of which are typically supportive of good sleep quality.

Psychological, lifestyle, and behavioral context: Self-report measures show low current depressive and trait anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76; STAI = 35, Z = -0.62), elevated self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.82) and high health satisfaction (Z = 1.8). The participant reports regular solo exercise (three or more times per week, Z ≈ 1.07) and limited recreational drug use; alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week, Z ≈ 0.9–1.0). These psychosocial and behavioral indicators largely align with features that correlate with better sleep (e.g., low depressive/anxiety symptoms and regular exercise), and the higher self-rated health satisfaction further supports a profile that would tend to predict lower PSQI scores.

Evidence suggesting higher PSQI (poorer sleep): Several features could contribute to elevated PSQI components. Sleep onset near 1:00 AM and nontrivial variability in sleep start time (SD ≈ 81 min) may feed into subjective complaints captured by PSQI subscales for sleep latency or sleep efficiency. Moderate weekly alcohol consumption can impair sleep continuity or subjective sleep quality for some individuals, even though the observed correlations with PSQI in this sample are small. Finally, some small positive correlations in the data (e.g., between depressive symptom scores and PSQI, CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40) mean that, were these symptoms to increase, PSQI would likely worsen — although current symptom levels are low.

Evidence suggesting lower PSQI (better sleep): Conversely, multiple converging indicators support relatively good sleep quality. Objective sleep duration is adequate (≈7 h), night-to-night variability is not elevated, naps are absent, and circadian measures show strong regularity and amplitude — all features associated with lower (better) PSQI. The marked nocturnal heart-rate declines and low resting heart rate are physiologically consistent with consolidated, restorative nighttime rest. Low scores on depression and anxiety measures, frequent exercise, and high health satisfaction further argue for subjectively better sleep and lower PSQI values.

Overall inference and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of objective circadian regularity, adequate sleep duration, low nocturnal physiological arousal, low mood/anxiety symptoms, and regular exercise suggests that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely better than average in the study sample. Therefore, it is most consistent with a PSQI level below the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73). This conclusion is probabilistic and tempered by the participant’s somewhat late habitual sleep onset and moderate alcohol use, which could raise specific PSQI subcomponents for some individuals; however, the combined physiological and psychosocial profile favors a PSQI score lower (i.e., indicating better sleep) than the sample mean."
62617,"Summary: Integrating the wearable-derived physiology, sleep timing and duration metrics, and self-report psychosocial measures produces a mixed but overall favorable picture of sleep quality. Several robust indicators (long median nightly sleep, consolidated nocturnal heart‑rate decline, low nap frequency, regular sleep-duration variability, and low affective symptom burden) point toward sleep quality that is at least as good as, and likely somewhat better than, the study sample average. Countervailing signals from the circadian analysis (reduced amplitude and low interdaily stability) suggest some between-day irregularity in circadian organization that could modestly undermine sleep continuity. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is below the population mean PSQI (i.e., better sleep quality than the sample average).

Evidence consistent with poorer sleep (higher PSQI)
- Circadian regularity and amplitude: Interdaily stability is low (value 0.20; Z = -1.73) and amplitude is reduced (7.67; Z = -1.01). Low interdaily stability indicates that the timing of physiological rhythms is not highly consistent day‑to‑day, and reduced amplitude indicates a relatively flattened heart‑rate rhythm. Both features are commonly associated with circadian misalignment or weaker day–night differentiation and can contribute to poorer subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction.
- Bedtime timing and variability: Median sleep start is near midnight (23:56) with a sleep‑start SD of about 70 minutes (Z ≈ -0.28), indicating occasional variability in bedtime. Although the magnitude is not extreme, irregular bedtimes over time can exacerbate circadian instability and impair sleep consolidation for some individuals.
- Modest risk factors: BMI = 26.6 and moderate weekly wine use (1–2 times/week) are not large but are potential contributors to sleep disruption in some people; these factors should be considered alongside behavioral and physiological patterns.

Evidence consistent with better sleep (lower PSQI)
- Long, relatively stable nightly sleep: Median sleep duration is long (8 hours 25 minutes; Z = 1.53) and sleep‑duration variability is not elevated (SD ≈ 78 minutes; Z = -0.51). Longer habitual sleep and relatively low night‑to‑night variability in duration generally predict better subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning.
- Consolidated nocturnal physiology: Hourly heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–6:00 AM, values around -11 to -13 bpm relative to mesor), consistent with consolidated physiological sleep and typical nocturnal parasympathetic dominance. Resting heart rate is in a normal range (60.6 bpm; Z = 0.29). These signs are consistent with restorative nocturnal physiology rather than fragmented or shallow sleep.
- Low daytime napping and regular activity: Mean daily naps ≈ 0 (Z = -0.86) and intradaily variability is low (0.34; Z = -1.45), suggesting the participant does not frequently nap and has relatively few abrupt transitions between rest and activity across the waking day—both behaviors that support consolidated nocturnal sleep.
- Psychosocial protection: Scores indicate low depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = -1.28) and low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.31), with relatively high self‑esteem and happiness (RSES Z = 1.24; happiness Z = 1.64) and frequent exercise (exercised alone ≥3×/week; Z ≈ 1.07). These psychological and behavioral factors are associated with better subjective sleep quality and lower PSQI in the study correlations, and they provide substantial evidence against a high PSQI for this individual.

Circadian/physiological synthesis
- The circadian profile is heterogeneous: within‑day structure appears reasonable (pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate trough, low intradaily variability, positive 24‑hour autocorrelation Z ≈ 0.98), but the between‑day structure is weaker (low interdaily stability and reduced amplitude). In practical terms this suggests the participant generally obtains consolidated physiological sleep each night but may vary the timing or intensity of daily routines across days. That pattern can produce good single‑night physiology yet still permit subjective complaints or objective sleep fragmentation under some conditions. Given the small-to-moderate size of these circadian deviations (Zs ~ -1.0 to -1.7), any adverse effect on sleep quality is likely to be modest rather than severe.

Overall conclusion relative to the study sample
- Balancing the above evidence, the participant most likely has a PSQI score below the population mean of 6.73 (i.e., relatively better sleep quality than the average study participant). The strongest contributors to this inference are long and reasonably consistent sleep duration, clear nocturnal physiological downregulation, minimal napping, regular exercise, and low affective symptom burden. Factors that temper confidence in exceptionally good sleep are reduced circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability, which suggest some between‑day irregularity that could elevate PSQI modestly for this person. Because many of the correlations between individual metrics and PSQI in the sample are small, there remains some uncertainty; the weight of multimodal evidence, however, points to sleep quality that is at least near and most likely somewhat better than the study mean.

Note on uncertainty and limits
- This assessment integrates group-relative Z‑scores, aggregated hourly physiology, and self‑report but does not replace direct PSQI measurement. Several PSQI components (sleep quality, latency, medication use, daytime dysfunction) are not fully captured by the provided metrics; thus, the conclusion about being below the population mean should be viewed as a probabilistic inference rather than a definitive score."
42137,"The self-report data indicate a mixed psychological profile with respect to sleep-relevant risk factors. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42, Z = 0.07) and perceived stress (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92) are elevated relative to the sample and correlate positively with worse PSQI scores in this study (STAI r ≈ 0.40; CES-D r ≈ 0.49; PSS r ≈ 0.20). Depressive symptoms are present at a modest level (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18) and have one of the stronger study correlations with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49), indicating that mood-related symptoms are a salient contributor to reported poor sleep in this sample. Self-esteem is slightly below the sample mean (RSES Z = -0.17), and self-rated happiness is lower than average (Z ≈ -0.53); both show negative correlations with PSQI in the study (higher self-esteem/happiness → better sleep), which is consistent with the pattern of emotional risk factors that could elevate subjective sleep disturbance for this participant.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological metrics show a generally intact 24-hour structure but with some indications of fragmentation. Interdaily stability (0.45, Z = 0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.35, Z = 0.22) indicate moderately consistent day-to-day heart rate rhythms, while intradaily variability (0.63, Z = 0.60) is somewhat elevated, reflecting more within-day variability or rhythm fragmentation. The participant’s resting heart rate and MESOR are relatively low (RHR = 50.3 bpm, MESOR ≈ 62.6 bpm; both Z ≪ 0), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and robust nocturnal heart rate dipping: hourly deviations show pronounced negative deviations overnight (nadir ≈ -20 bpm around 3–5 AM) and strong daytime peaks (notably +27 bpm at 4–5 PM). These physiological patterns (low RHR and clear nocturnal dip) are typically linked with restorative sleep physiology and, in this dataset, have weak-to-small correlations with PSQI (RHR r ≈ 0.12; amplitude/mesor correlations small), suggesting largely favorable objective recovery despite some rhythm fragmentation.

Objective sleep timing and duration metrics are largely within normative bounds. Median nightly duration is 7 hours 18 minutes (Z = 0.14), with relatively modest night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 90 minutes, Z = -0.25) and in sleep start time (median start ≈ 00:31, SD ≈ 78 minutes, Z ≈ -0.10). Napping is rare (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07). These wearable sleep statistics point to sufficient sleep quantity and reasonable stability in timing across the recording period. The somewhat late median sleep onset (~00:30) is notable, however, because delayed or late bedtimes can contribute to subjective complaints even when total duration is adequate.

Balancing evidence for factors associated with poorer versus better sleep: indicators that align with higher PSQI (worse sleep) include elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, modest depressive symptom burden (all of which have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSQI in this sample), a relatively late sleep onset time, and a modestly elevated intradaily variability suggesting within-day rhythm fragmentation. Indicators that align with lower PSQI (better sleep) include objectively adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability in duration, rare napping, moderate interdaily stability of circadian heart rate, and favorable physiological recovery markers (low resting heart rate and pronounced nocturnal heart rate dipping). Low substance use and regular exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07) are additional behavioral supports for healthier sleep.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: integrating subjective risk (stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms) with broadly favorable objective sleep duration and physiological recovery, the overall profile is most consistent with an individual whose sleep quality is around the study sample average but with a modest elevation in subjective sleep disturbance risk. Therefore, the participant’s overall sleep quality as inferred from the multimodal data is best characterized as near the population mean PSQI, with a small tendency toward being above (worse than) the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). This conclusion reflects the competing influences of emotional distress—strongly associated with higher PSQI in this sample—and generally adequate objective sleep and fitness-related physiological markers that tend to protect against severe sleep impairment."
48013,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of risk and protective features for sleep quality. Objective wearable data indicate relatively late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:04 AM with substantial night-to-night variability) and reduced circadian regularity and amplitude in heart-rate rhythms. Self-report measures document elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 19) and trait anxiety (STAI = 55), low self-esteem, reduced happiness, and moderately elevated perceived stress. At the same time, the participant reports frequent exercise, low daytime napping, low recreational drug use, and a resting heart rate in a relatively healthy range. Taken together, the pattern is most consistent with disrupted/irregular sleep physiology and psychological distress that would tend to raise subjective sleep complaints, with some behavioral supports that may mitigate but not eliminate these risks.

Features that point toward poorer sleep (higher PSQI): 
- Psychological symptom burden: Depressive symptom score (CES-D = 19; Z ≈ 0.59) and trait anxiety (STAI = 55; Z ≈ 1.35) are elevated and these scales show the largest positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40). Elevated perceived stress (PSS = 25) and low self-esteem (RSES z = -1.43, correlation with PSQI ≈ -0.35) are additional psychosocial risks associated with worse sleep. 
- Circadian irregularity and blunted rhythmicity: Interdaily stability is low (0.23; Z ≈ -1.48) and cosinor amplitude is reduced (7.44; Z ≈ -1.08), indicating weaker and less consistent 24-hour structure in heart-rate rhythms across days—patterns that are often linked to poorer subjective sleep quality. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (Z ≈ -1.54), supporting inconsistent daily timing. 
- Late and variable sleep timing: Median sleep start ~01:04 AM with a large night-to-night standard deviation (sleep start SD ≈ 119 minutes, Z ≈ 0.8) and a high sleep-duration SD (151 minutes, Z ≈ 1.13). Increased variability in timing and duration correlates modestly with worse PSQI (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18) and is clinically relevant for subjective sleep disturbance.
- Physiological arousal pattern: The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show an unusually large morning rise at 6–7 AM (deviation +8.33; Z ≈ 3.50), suggesting pronounced morning cardiovascular activation. Elevated morning arousal and large day-to-day rhythm fluctuations can be associated with fragmented sleep or early awakenings that worsen subjective sleep.

Features that point toward better sleep (lower PSQI): 
- Adequate median sleep duration: Median wearable sleep duration ~6 hours 56 minutes (Z ≈ -0.31) is close to the study mean and not dramatically short on average; this reduces the likelihood that objective short sleep duration alone explains poor subjective sleep. 
- Healthy lifestyle behaviors: Frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; z-scores ≈ +1.1 to +1.2) and low frequency of recreational or non-prescribed drug use are established protective factors for sleep; these behaviors show weak negative correlations with PSQI in the sample. Minimal napping (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07; Z ≈ -0.08) also reduces a common contributor to nighttime sleep disruption. 
- Cardiovascular fitness signal: Resting heart rate is modestly low (59.3 bpm; Z ≈ 0.14 relative to sample) and mesor is within typical range, which can reflect better baseline fitness and lower nocturnal cardiovascular strain.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Weighing the evidence, the balance of salient indicators suggests the participant is likely to report worse-than-average sleep quality. The strongest contributions to this inference come from elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (both showing relatively large correlations with PSQI), reduced circadian stability/amplitude, late and inconsistent sleep timing, and pronounced morning autonomic activation—each of which is independently associated with higher subjective sleep disturbance. Protective factors (regular exercise, near-normal median sleep duration, low napping, and limited substance use) likely moderate but do not fully offset the risks. Therefore, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being above the population mean PSQI (i.e., poorer sleep than average in this sample, where the sample mean = 6.72). This conclusion emphasizes relative likelihood rather than a categorical determination; the combination of psychosocial distress and circadian irregularity are the dominant drivers of the expected elevation in PSQI."
14571,"Protective features that point toward relatively good sleep quality are prominent across the survey and wearable-derived metrics. Psychologically, the participant reports very low depressive symptoms (CES-D z = -1.38) and low trait anxiety (STAI z = -2.11), along with relatively high self-esteem (RSES z = 1.10) and low perceived stress (PSS z = -2.62). These self-report indices have moderate-to-strong population correlations with PSQI in this study (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40, RSES r ≈ -0.35), and the participant’s favorable scores on these measures therefore weigh substantially toward a lower (better) PSQI. Wearable sleep statistics further support reasonably good sleep: median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 14 min (z = 0.06), sleep duration variability is low (SD 35 min, z = -1.48), and naps are infrequent (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07). Physiologically, heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a robust and regular rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.70, z = 2.40; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.59, z = 2.24; intradaily variability = 0.22, z = -2.29), and nocturnal hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nighttime dip (large negative deviations 1–6 AM), consistent with consolidated, restorative sleep. Together these psychological, behavioral and physiological signals principally indicate lower sleep disturbance and therefore a lower PSQI score.

At the same time, several features could contribute to worse subjective sleep quality and therefore push PSQI upward. The participant’s typical sleep onset time is late (median sleep start ~01:04 AM), which can be associated with circadian misalignment or difficulty initiating sleep despite adequate total sleep time. Daily evening and sedentary recreation are pronounced: very high screen and sedentary hobby engagement (TV, video games, internet, music, socializing all >4 hours; several z-scores >2), and very limited exercise participation (exercise z-scores strongly negative). These lifestyle factors—particularly high evening screen time and low physical activity—are plausibly detrimental to sleep initiation, sleep continuity, and perceived sleep quality even when objective duration is adequate. Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly above the sample mean (RHR 62.4 bpm, z = 0.51; mesor z = 1.35) but have only weak correlations with PSQI in the sample, so they are of limited interpretive weight.

Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most directly PSQI-relevant indicators (low depression and anxiety, low perceived stress, regular and consolidated circadian/heart-rate patterns, adequate and relatively stable sleep duration) favor relatively good sleep quality, while the most salient risk factors are behavioral (late habitual bedtime, high evening screen/sedentary behavior, and minimal exercise). Taking both sets of evidence together, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with a PSQI lower (better) than the study sample mean. Compared to the sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD 2.16), the composite pattern suggests this individual’s sleep quality is likely below the population mean (i.e., better than average in this sample), though late sleep timing and evening behaviors represent modifiable risks that could worsen subjective sleep quality despite otherwise favorable physiological and psychological indicators."
69057,"Summary of sleep quantity and timing: Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate short and irregular nightly sleep. Median sleep duration was 5 hours 35 minutes (Z = -1.99), well below the study average, and night-to-night variability in duration was substantial (SD = 122 minutes, Z = +0.49). Median sleep start time was late (02:08 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD = 53 minutes, Z = -0.66). These objective markers—consistently short sleep, late bedtimes, and marked variability—are classically associated with worse subjective sleep quality and higher PSQI scores.

Factors suggesting poorer sleep (supporting a relatively high PSQI): Several behavioral, psychological, and circadian features point toward elevated sleep disturbance. Trait anxiety (STAI = 53, Z = +1.16) and perceived stress (PSS = 26, Z = +1.19) are both elevated; both measures correlate positively with PSQI in the dataset and are established contributors to sleep difficulty. Low interdaily stability (0.32, Z = -0.74) and reduced cosinor-derived amplitude (8.68, Z = -0.68) indicate a less robust, less regular 24-hour cardiac rhythm, and intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.60, Z = +0.39), all of which are associated with fragmented or misaligned sleep. The combination of late sleep timing, short duration, high variability, and psychological arousal is coherent with patterns that typically raise PSQI scores.

Factors suggesting better sleep (supporting a relatively low PSQI): There are several protective features in the profile. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone three times per week, Z = +1.07), low use of alcohol and non-prescription drugs, few naps (mean daily naps = 0.07), and a low body-mass index (BMI = 23.9). Resting heart rate is unusually low (43.6 bpm, Z = -1.73) and nocturnal heart-rate deviations show a pronounced overnight decline (e.g., -22.5 bpm at 5–6 AM), which can reflect good cardiovascular fitness and intact sleep-related autonomic downregulation. These elements typically protect sleep continuity and daytime functioning and can temper the degree of subjective sleep impairment.

Physiological rhythm and heart-rate pattern synthesis: Cardiac markers give a mixed picture. The low mesor and low resting heart rate (both strongly negative Z-scores) likely reflect high cardiovascular fitness rather than pathology; this is consistent with the large overnight heart-rate decline. However, the reduced circadian amplitude and lower interdaily stability suggest the timing and strength of daily physiological rhythms are blunted or irregular, which aligns with the late and variable sleep schedule. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations also show elevated evening activity (notably a large positive deviation around 5–6 PM and a smaller positive deviation around midnight), which may reflect evening arousal or activity that could delay sleep onset.

Behavioral and psychosocial context: The participant reports lower-than-average happiness and health satisfaction and somewhat lower interpersonal trust and self-esteem; while not extreme, these indicators align with elevated stress and anxiety and can contribute to poorer subjective sleep. Academic performance history shows declining GPAs over time, which may reflect ongoing psychosocial or workload pressures. Conversely, low substance use, consistent exercise, and minimal daytime napping are behaviors that reduce some common contributors to sleep disturbance.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing all evidence, the profile contains multiple substantive risk factors for poor subjective sleep (short median sleep duration, late and variable bedtimes, elevated trait anxiety and stress, and reduced circadian stability), partially counterbalanced by protective fitness- and behavior-related features (frequent exercise, low substance use, robust nocturnal heart-rate decline). Taken together, the preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely worse than the study sample average—that is, inferred PSQI is likely above the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72, SD = 2.16). The strongest contributors to that inference are the objectively short and irregular sleep and the elevated anxiety/stress measures; fitness and low substance use may mitigate but do not fully offset these risk factors."
64232,"Summary and protective features: The wearable and survey data indicate several factors that would tend to support relatively good sleep quantity and recovery. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 8:00 hours (Z = +1.01), well above the study mean and consistent with adequate sleep opportunity; the participant reports essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), suggesting nocturnal sleep is the main restorative episode. Regular participation in sports at a high frequency (three times a week or more; Z = +1.58) is another behavior associated with better sleep consolidation in many samples. Resting heart rate (59.4 bpm; Z = +0.15) and body mass index (21.85) are within ranges commonly linked with good cardiometabolic health rather than clear sleep pathology. Together, these features point toward sufficient sleep duration and some healthy lifestyle supports that would be expected to lower the PSQI (i.e., indicate better subjective sleep quality).

Features associated with poorer sleep quality: Multiple indicators point toward irregular and potentially disturbed sleep timing and physiological arousal that are likely to increase PSQI scores. Night-to-night variability in sleep is elevated: sleep duration standard deviation is 136 minutes (Z = +0.79) and sleep start time standard deviation is 150 minutes (Z = +1.48), indicating inconsistent bedtimes and variable total sleep across days. Circadian-regularity metrics derived from heart rate further emphasize irregularity: interdaily stability is low (0.22; Z = -1.56), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (0.26; Z = -0.53), both consistent with weak day-to-day circadian entrainment. In addition, several behavioral and psychological risk factors that correlate with worse PSQI are present: perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 27; Z = +1.47), trait anxiety is above the sample mean (STAI = 44; Z = +0.27), and recreational drug use is an outlying behavior in this sample (1–2 times a month; Z = +3.52). These variables have modest positive correlations with PSQI in the study and together suggest vulnerability to poorer subjective sleep quality.

Physiological circadian pattern and nocturnal arousal: The participant’s cosinor-derived circadian profile shows a mesor of 77.33 (Z = +0.46) and a modest amplitude (10.24; Z = -0.17) with an acrophase near 4:57 PM—an expected daytime heart rate peak. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show robust nocturnal declines around 2–4 AM (e.g., −16.8 to −19.1 bpm), but there are relatively smaller reductions (less negative deviation) at 4–5 AM (−9.6; Z = +1.40) and persistent positive deviations in the late evening and early night (e.g., 9–11 PM deviations of +13.2, +8.0; Zs up to +0.90). The pattern of elevated late-evening heart rate and a blunted nadir or earlier rebound toward morning is consistent with evening physiological arousal and possible early-morning activation or fragmented sleep. Notably, the nocturnal heart-rate deviations around 2–4 AM have the largest positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (correlations ~0.20–0.23), suggesting these physiological features align with self-reported poor sleep in the sample.

Behavioral context and subjective symptoms: The participant’s self-report profile provides mixed information. Depression symptoms are not elevated (CES-D = 13; Z = -0.03), but trait anxiety and perceived stress are above average, and current self-rated happiness is below the sample mean (Z = -0.53). Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times a week; Zs ≈ +1.0), and recreational drug use is markedly higher than peers (Z = +3.52); both substance-use patterns can disturb sleep continuity or sleep architecture and have small positive correlations with PSQI in this study. On the other hand, the participant reports active engagement in sports and low sedentary entertainment time, which are protective.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the participant exhibits objectively adequate sleep duration and lifestyle supports that favor good sleep, yet clear markers of irregular sleep timing, weakened circadian stability, late-evening physiological arousal, elevated perceived stress/anxiety, and notable recreational drug use point toward fragmented or lower-quality sleep on many days. Given the relative magnitude of timing irregularity (sleep start SD Z = +1.48), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.56), elevated stress (Z = +1.47), and physiologic signs of evening/morning arousal that correlate with poorer PSQI in this sample, the overall pattern is more consistent with a PSQI score that is above the study population mean (i.e., worse sleep quality than average) rather than below it. This inference is moderate in confidence: long median sleep duration and favorable health habits partially offset risk factors, so the participant would most plausibly fall in the range above the mean but not an extreme outlier.

Key actionable implications (interpretive, not prescriptive): The strongest targets for improving sleep quality would be increasing regularity of sleep timing and strengthening daily circadian cues (to raise interdaily stability), reducing late-evening physiological arousal (behavioral wind-down, limiting stimulating substances late in the day), and addressing elevated perceived stress and anxiety. Monitoring the timing consistency of sleep and reducing variability in bedtime and sleep duration are likely to have the greatest impact on lowering PSQI in this individual."
37404,"Factors in the data that are consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (i.e., features that, in the study sample, tend to co-occur with higher PSQI scores) include several circadian/actigraphic markers. Interdaily stability is low (0.22; Z = -1.56), indicating relatively weak day-to-day regularity of heart-rate–based rhythms, and intradaily variability is elevated (0.74; Z = 1.37), suggesting greater fragmentation of physiological activity within days. Both of these metrics depart meaningfully from the sample mean and are commonly interpreted as reduced circadian robustness or greater daily rhythm disruption—patterns that have been associated with worse subjective sleep quality in prior work. Amplitude from the cosinor analysis is also low (6.01; Z = -1.54), which reflects a flatter 24-hour heart rate profile and can indicate blunted circadian drive; in the cohort amplitude showed a small negative correlation with PSQI (higher amplitude → lower PSQI), so this low amplitude points weakly in the direction of worse sleep. The participant’s median sleep start time is relatively late (00:48), which can be associated with circadian misalignment for socially constrained schedules. Resting heart rate is slightly above the sample mean (60.8 bpm; Z = 0.32), a small effect that in this sample had a weak positive association with PSQI.

Conversely, multiple behavioral, subjective, and wearable sleep statistics point toward relatively good sleep quality (features that, in the study sample, tend to co-occur with lower PSQI scores). Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 9 minutes (Z = -0.04), i.e., very close to the sample median and within a range typically associated with satisfactory sleep. The participant reports essentially no napping (mean daily naps = 0.0; Z = -0.86) and shows modest night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep duration SD = 66 minutes, Z = -0.78; sleep start SD = 65 minutes, Z = -0.39), which are lower-than-average variability indices in this cohort and, in this sample, variability showed a positive correlation with PSQI—so lower variability is a favorable sign. Psychological symptom scores are generally low: CES-D = 7 (Z = -0.66) and STAI–Trait = 35 (Z = -0.62); depressive and anxiety symptoms in this study are among the stronger predictors of higher PSQI (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49, STAI correlation = 0.40), so the participant’s low scores on these scales weigh toward better subjective sleep quality. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07), a behavior that in this dataset weakly associated with lower PSQI. Wearable-derived night-time heart-rate behavior shows robust nocturnal dipping (hourly deviations from mesor of about -8 to -16 bpm between ~2:00–6:00 AM), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest physiology rather than fragmented or physiologically aroused sleep.

Weighing the evidence, the profile is mixed but leans modestly toward sleep quality near or slightly better than the study sample average. Objective circadian markers (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, and reduced amplitude) are clear deviations and represent the strongest objective signals favoring higher PSQI (worse sleep) in this participant; however, subjective and behavioral indicators that are strongly associated with PSQI in this sample—low depressive and anxiety symptoms, adequate median sleep duration, low napping, and regular exercise—are all favorable and argue for comparatively good sleep. Considering the magnitude of the departures and the direction of the sample correlations, a balanced inference is that this participant’s overall sleep quality is near the study sample mean PSQI (population mean = 6.72), likely at or slightly below that mean (i.e., marginally better than average), rather than substantially worse.

In short: circadian irregularity and reduced rhythm amplitude are the most salient objective risk signals for elevated PSQI in this profile, while normal-to-healthy sleep duration, low mood/anxiety burden, limited napping, and regular exercise are the dominant protective signals. If the objective goal is to reduce potential sleep disturbance, regularizing daily timing (increasing day-to-day schedule consistency and daytime activity structure, which would tend to increase interdaily stability and amplitude) would be the most targeted behavioral focus suggested by these data."
70492,"Summary — overall inference: Taken together, the pattern of self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived metrics suggests that this participant’s sleep quality is likely worse than the average participant in this study sample. Relative to the population PSQI mean of 6.73 (SD 2.16), the balance of evidence points to an overall sleep profile that would place the participant above the population mean (i.e., relatively poorer sleep), driven principally by late and unstable sleep timing and by elevated mood and stress symptoms that are moderately correlated with PSQI in this sample.

Features that indicate relatively poorer sleep quality
- Late and irregular sleep timing: the participant’s median sleep start time is very late (about 03:03 AM) and their night-to-night variability in sleep start time is elevated (SD 138 minutes, Z = 1.21). Late bedtimes and inconsistent timing are well-established contributors to poorer subjective sleep quality and are associated here with a modest positive correlation with PSQI (sleep start time SD correlation ~0.18).  
- Large night-to-night variability in sleep duration: median sleep duration (about 7 h 5 min) is near the sample mean, but the standard deviation of nightly sleep is very large (222 minutes, Z = 2.75). Greater variability in sleep duration tends to co-occur with worse PSQI (correlation ~0.21) and implies unstable sleep schedules or occasional long/short nights that can degrade perceived sleep quality.  
- Elevated mood and stress symptoms: depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16; Z = 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76) are both above the study mean and show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D correlation ~0.49; STAI correlation ~0.40). Perceived stress is also relatively high (PSS = 25; Z = 0.92), and is positively associated with PSQI (correlation ~0.20). These psychological factors are likely important drivers of poorer sleep in this case.  
- Low exercise and moderate alcohol use: low frequency of exercise (exercise Z-scores negative) and weekly beer consumption (1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.0) are behavioral features that can contribute to disturbed or lower-quality sleep, and they appear alongside the other risk factors above.

Features that indicate relatively better sleep quality
- Adequate median sleep duration: despite late timing, median total sleep time is approximately 7 hours and appears close to the population mean (duration Z = -0.13), which by itself supports reasonable sleep opportunity on many nights. Duration shows little direct relationship with PSQI here (correlation ~0.05), suggesting quantity is not the main problem.  
- Low napping and lower resting physiological load: the participant reports essentially no daily naps (mean naps = 0; Z = -0.86), which reduces the likelihood that daytime sleep fragments nocturnal consolidation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.6 bpm; Z = -0.54), which can reflect good cardiovascular fitness or low baseline sympathetic tone and is not a direct marker of poor sleep in this dataset (RHR correlation with PSQI ~0.12).  
- Moderately preserved circadian organization by some metrics: interdaily stability (0.43; Z = 0.17) and intradaily variability (0.54; Z = -0.04) are near the sample average, indicating the participant has some day-to-day regularity and not extreme fragmentation of activity rhythms. Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations also show clear overnight reductions in heart rate and daytime elevations (i.e., a recognizable day–night structure), which is consistent with consolidated nighttime sleep physiology.

Physiological/circadian interpretation
- Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate a recognizable but somewhat attenuated rhythm: cosinor-derived amplitude and mesor are both below the sample mean (amplitude Z = -0.44; mesor Z = -0.60), and acrophase is in the late-afternoon (≈5:12 PM). The aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced negative deviations overnight (largest negative departures in the pre-dawn hours), consistent with nocturnal cardiac slowing during sleep. The combination of a clear day–night heart rate pattern with reduced amplitude and somewhat blunted circadian metrics can be interpreted as preserved sleep-related physiology occurring at a shifted (late) phase and with less pronounced circadian amplitude — a pattern that is often associated with later sleep timing and with subjective complaints about sleep regularity or quality.

Holistic conclusion
- Weighting the evidence, the most salient contributors to a higher PSQI are late and inconsistent sleep timing and substantial night-to-night variability in sleep duration, together with elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and perceived stress — all of which show moderate relationships with PSQI in this sample. Countervailing evidence (adequate median total sleep time, absence of napping, a clear though somewhat blunted day–night heart rate pattern, and a low resting heart rate) attenuates but does not override the risk factors. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a PSQI score above the sample mean (i.e., relatively poorer subjective sleep compared with peers), with irregular timing and psychosocial stressors likely the principal targets for behavioral or clinical interventions aimed at improving sleep quality."
95543,"Summary of key patterns: The participant shows a combination of late-timed sleep behavior with physiologically strong and regular daily rhythms and generally low psychosocial risk. Wearable-recorded median sleep duration is 7 hours 25 minutes (Z = 0.29), sleep-duration variability is relatively low (SD = 60 min; Z = -0.92) and the participant reports virtually no naps. Circadian heart-rate metrics indicate a pronounced, regular 24-hour rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.54, Z = 1.08; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.51, Z = 1.57; amplitude moderately elevated, Z = 0.78) with an acrophase in the early evening (6:35 PM). Self-report instruments show low depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D and STAI Z-scores -1.28 and -1.81), low perceived stress (PSS Z = -0.98), good health satisfaction (Z = 1.3) and high positive affect/self-esteem (happiness Z = 1.64; self-esteem Z = 1.52). These features together point to substantial behavioral regularity and limited affective burden across the recording period.

Factors that would tend to raise PSQI (indicate poorer sleep quality): The most salient risk signal is the very late habitual sleep onset (median sleep start time ~02:25 AM). Late sleep timing can contribute to components of poor sleep on the PSQI related to sleep latency, timing, and daytime dysfunction even when total sleep time is adequate. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the study population (RHR = 66.7, mesor = 82.9; Z-scores ~1.0–1.2), and there are marked positive heart-rate deviations in the evening (notably 8–9 PM and 6–9 PM with large positive deviations and high Z-scores), plus a small positive deviation around midnight (12–1 AM). These evening/midnight heart-rate elevations are consistent with later-day physiological activation or arousal that could delay sleep onset or fragment sleep. Some evening recreational habits (e.g., watching 1–2 hours of video/TV and above-average video game time, Z = 1.71) are additional behavioral factors that can be associated with later bedtimes and with subjective sleep disturbance in other samples.

Factors that would tend to lower PSQI (indicate better sleep quality): Several objective and self-report indicators support relatively good sleep quality. Total nightly sleep duration is modestly above the sample mean and sleep duration shows low night-to-night variability, which tends to be protective for sleep quality and daytime functioning. Circadian measures show strong day-to-day regularity (high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation) and moderate amplitude, implying a well-structured daily rhythm rather than an erratic schedule — a pattern that is generally associated with fewer sleep complaints. The participant reports minimal depressive and anxiety symptoms, low stress, high health satisfaction and good social/exercise engagement (exercising with others three or more times per week, Z = 1.23) and no substance use; these psychosocial and behavioral supports are robust correlates of better subjective sleep in the literature and in the study correlations provided.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the dominant protective signals are adequate total sleep time, low intra-individual variability in sleep, strong and regular circadian structure, and low affective symptoms — all of which predict lower PSQI scores (better sleep). The dominant risk signal is the consistently late sleep timing accompanied by evening physiological activation and some evening screen-based activities, which plausibly increase the likelihood of sleep complaints for this participant. Taking these factors together, the data are most consistent with sleep quality near to or modestly better than the study sample average. In the context of the population PSQI mean of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the profile is best characterized as near the mean or slightly below the population mean (i.e., slightly better sleep quality than average), rather than substantially worse. 

Caveats: This synthesis integrates cross-sectional aggregates (wearable-hour averages, circadian summary metrics) with self-report snapshots and does not substitute for nightly PSQI component scores or clinical evaluation. The late timing of sleep is a clear behavioral characteristic that could change contextually (e.g., during academic deadlines or social schedules) and may interact with outcomes not fully captured here (daytime sleepiness, work/class performance). If intervention were considered, targeting evening activation (reducing stimulating evening screen time, shifting evening routines earlier) would be the most direct behavioral leverage to reduce the risk-related features in this profile while preserving the participant’s evident strengths (consistent schedule, exercise, low distress)."
67106,"Summary: The multimodal data paint a mixed but overall reasonably favorable picture of sleep-related physiology and psychosocial functioning. Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a robust, regular daily rhythm (interdaily stability Z = 1.9; 24‑hour autocorrelation Z = 2.07) with low within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = -0.53). Nighttime cardiovascular physiology shows a pronounced drop in heart rate relative to the mesor (largest negative deviations of ~-20 beats/min overnight), and a relatively low resting heart rate (56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22), both compatible with consolidated nocturnal quiescence. Self-report measures show low depressive and anxiety symptom burden (CES‑D Z = -1.18; STAI Z = -1.22), relatively high reported happiness and health satisfaction (Happy Z = 1.64; Health Satisfaction Z = 1.47), and minimal substance use — factors that tend to co-occur with better subjective sleep.

Evidence suggesting higher PSQI (poorer sleep): Several behavioral and temporal markers point toward influences that could elevate PSQI. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (01:28 AM), and median nightly sleep duration is modest (6 h 46 min; duration Z = -0.51), both of which commonly relate to worse subjective sleep quality. Night-to-night variability is nontrivial (sleep duration SD = 98 minutes; sleep start SD = 88 minutes) and moderately correlated with PSQI in this dataset, and low habitual exercise frequency (exercising alone less than 1–2 times/month; Z = -1.18) is another behavioral correlate associated with poorer sleep. The aggregated hourly heart‑rate profile shows elevated heart rate in the early-to-late evening window (notable positive deviations 6–9 PM), suggesting relatively high evening physiological activation or activity that could impede earlier sleep onset. Taken together, late timing, somewhat short average sleep, variability in timing/duration, low physical activity, and evidence of evening arousal are features that could contribute to a higher PSQI score.

Evidence suggesting lower PSQI (better sleep): Counterbalancing the above, the participant’s physiological and psychosocial profile includes several strong protective indicators. The circadian waveform is regular and high in stability (interdaily stability and autocorrelation Z-scores near +2), which is empirically linked to better sleep consolidation and subjective sleep. Nighttime heart-rate suppression is pronounced and consistent, indicating effective nocturnal downregulation of physiological arousal. Low scores on depressive and anxiety symptom scales, low perceived stress (PSS Z = -0.98), high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, minimal substance use, and low frequency of naps are all factors associated with better subjective sleep. These features suggest that, despite a late schedule, sleep episodes when they occur may be physiologically restorative.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study sample mean: Balancing these lines of evidence, the participant appears to have overall sleep quality near or somewhat better than the study sample average. The combination of regular circadian timing and robust nocturnal physiological downregulation, along with low affective symptom burden, argues for relatively good objective sleep physiology and likely reasonably good subjective sleep. However, the late habitual bedtime and modest average sleep duration and variability are countervailing influences that may limit sleep quality for this individual. Relative to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the profile is most consistent with a PSQI at or slightly below the population mean (i.e., near the mean to modestly better than average), rather than markedly worse.

Uncertainties and caveats: Wearable-derived heart-rate and timing data do not measure sleep architecture or many subjective dimensions of sleep captured by the PSQI (sleep latency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction). Also, correlations between specific metrics and PSQI in the sample are modest; the inferences above synthesize multiple weak-to-moderate indicators rather than a single definitive signal. Overall, the data suggest a resilient physiological rhythm and low affective burden that likely support reasonably good sleep, while late timing, limited sleep duration, and low exercise represent actionable areas that could worsen subjective sleep quality if persistent."
83612,"Summary: The available multimodal data show a mixed picture of sleep and circadian function. Objectively, the participant tends to obtain a moderate nightly sleep duration (median 6 h 42 min, Z = -0.59) with few naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86) and clear nocturnal reductions in heart rate (hourly deviations of ~-14 to -19 bpm across the core sleep hours). At the same time the heart-rate–derived circadian rhythm exhibits low day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.28, Z = -1.07), relatively high within-day fragmentation of activity (intradaily variability = 0.70, Z = 1.09), and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.17, Z = -1.29). Trait-level psychological features include elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 58, Z = 1.65) and a modestly elevated depressive symptom score (CES‑D = 15), plus below-average self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.29). Taken together, these objective and self-report features point to competing influences on sleep quality.

Evidence pointing toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several elements are associated with worse sleep. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.65; score–PSQI correlation ~0.41) and the depressive symptom measure (CES‑D; correlation ~0.49) are among the strongest psychological correlates in this dataset and commonly portend more sleep difficulty (longer sleep latency, worse subjective quality, or more disturbances). Circadian metrics indicate instability and fragmentation (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, low 24‑hour autocorrelation), a pattern associated with irregular sleep timing and impaired sleep consolidation. The participant’s median sleep start is relatively late (00:51) and sleep start variability is nontrivial (SD ≈ 84 min), which can contribute to sleep dissatisfaction or shortened time in bed. Several objective features that correlate modestly with PSQI (sleep duration SD correlation ~0.2; sleep start SD correlation ~0.18) also point toward variability-related risk for poorer subjective sleep.

Evidence pointing toward better sleep quality (lower PSQI): The objective nocturnal physiology and some behavioral habits support better sleep potential. The participant shows a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline across the sleep window (hourly deviations typically -14 to -19 bpm), and a low resting heart rate (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42), both consistent with preserved nocturnal parasympathetic dominance and the ability to achieve physiologic sleep states. Median sleep duration of ≈6 h 42 min is only modestly below population average (Z = -0.59) and not extremely short; the absence of daytime napping reduces the likelihood that daytime sleep fragments nocturnal sleep. Low use of alcohol and drugs, modest—but present—exercise, and generally average health satisfaction are further behavioral features that would tend to support reasonable sleep quality.

Integration and likely overall level relative to the sample: Balancing these signals, the most salient risk factors are elevated trait anxiety and mood symptoms together with circadian instability/fragmentation—factors that have relatively strong and consistent associations with higher PSQI scores in this dataset. Protective signals (nocturnal heart-rate suppression, absence of naps, only modestly short median sleep) mitigate but do not fully offset those risks. Therefore, the preponderance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely worse than the study sample average. In relative terms, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI score above the population mean of 6.73 (i.e., “above the population mean”), rather than near or below it.

Uncertainty and caveats: Objective indicators (HR patterns, median sleep duration) and subjective symptom measures sometimes point in different directions; correlations between many wearable metrics and PSQI in this sample are modest. The inference that sleep quality is above the population mean reflects the combined weight of psychological risk (anxiety/depressive symptoms) plus circadian irregularity rather than a single definitive marker."
92566,"Summary impression: The participant’s multimodal profile is mixed with respect to sleep quality. Objective wearable-derived sleep behavior shows features commonly associated with poorer sleep—shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 17 m), late and variable sleep start times (median ~00:48, start-time SD ~113 minutes) and elevated night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 120 minutes). In contrast, self-report trait and lifestyle measures (low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, regular exercise, low recreational drug use) are protective and would predict better subjective sleep. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests overall sleep quality that is around the study population average but leaning modestly toward poorer sleep (i.e., near to and possibly slightly above the population mean PSQI of 6.73).

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality
- Short median sleep duration (6 h 17 m; Z = -1.11) — this is below commonly recommended sleep amounts and below the study population mean, and shorter sleep is often associated with higher PSQI scores. The dataset also shows a positive correlation between sleep-duration variability and PSQI (SD of duration correlation ≈ 0.20), and this participant’s duration SD is elevated (120 min, Z = 0.43).
- Late and inconsistent bedtimes: median sleep start ~00:48 with large start-time variability (SD ≈ 113 min, Z = 0.66). Irregular sleep timing is associated with worse sleep quality in many studies and correlates modestly with PSQI here (start-time SD correlation ≈ 0.18).
- Modest circadian regularity: interdaily stability (0.40, Z ≈ -0.08) and intradaily variability (0.52, Z ≈ -0.18) are near the study mean but not strongly structured; weaker circadian regularity can contribute to poorer subjective sleep in some individuals.
- Alcohol frequency (wine/liquor 1–2×/week, Z = 0.94) may contribute to disrupted sleep for some people, though the PSQI correlations for these specific use items are small in this sample.

Evidence pointing toward relatively better sleep quality
- Low depressive and anxiety symptom burden: CES-D = 5 (Z ≈ -0.86) and STAI-Trait = 24 (Z ≈ -1.71). Both depressive and anxiety symptoms correlate positively with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D correlation ≈ 0.49, STAI ≈ 0.40), so the participant’s low scores on these measures are protective against poor subjective sleep.
- Positive psychosocial and health indicators: high self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ 1.38), high reported happiness (Z ≈ 1.64), and above-average health satisfaction (Z ≈ 1.22) are associated with lower PSQI in this sample (negative correlations ranging roughly -0.2 to -0.35), which would argue for better perceived sleep quality.
- Healthy lifestyle and fitness markers: regular exercise (exercising alone three+ times/week, Z ≈ 1.07) and a low resting heart rate (49 bpm, Z ≈ -1.08) suggest good physical fitness, which is generally associated with improved sleep quality and lower PSQI in population studies.
- Objective nightly physiology consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest: the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced overnight trough (largest negative deviations between ~2–5 AM), consistent with consolidated sleep during those hours and a normal nocturnal decline in cardiovascular activity.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to population mean
- The strongest objective flag for worse sleep is insufficient and inconsistent sleep timing/duration (short median duration and large night-to-night variability). Those features tend to elevate PSQI scores, and the wearable sleep metrics here align with modestly poorer objective sleep behavior.
- Conversely, the participant’s favorable mental-health profile and healthy lifestyle behaviors are salient protective factors that commonly reduce sleep complaints and PSQI scores.
- Balancing these domains, the overall picture is that this participant’s sleep quality is likely around the study sample average but somewhat compromised relative to optimal sleep: i.e., near the population mean PSQI (6.73) with a tendency toward slightly higher (worse) PSQI rather than clearly lower. In other words: near the mean, leaning slightly above it.

Caveats
- No direct PSQI score is provided, so this inference synthesizes objective wearable markers, trait/lifestyle self-reports, and correlations from the study sample rather than reporting an observed PSQI. The heart-rate summary data are temporally aggregated and cannot substitute for night-by-night subjective sleep disturbance reports."
35987,"Summary of key behavioral and physiological features
The participant’s wearable and self-report data describe a late but internally consistent sleep schedule, moderate shortness of sleep, and a well-entrained circadian signal. Median sleep start time is 02:45 AM and median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 32 minutes (Z = -0.81), with modest night-to-night variability in both start time (SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z = -0.64) and duration (SD ≈ 56 minutes, Z = -1.02). Wearable-derived circadian measures indicate relatively high interdaily stability (0.62, Z = 1.74) and above-average amplitude (14.36, Z = 1.16) of the heart-rate rhythm, with a pronounced evening increase in heart rate (peak deviations ~ +20 to +21 bpm at ~9–11 PM; e.g., 9–10 PM deviation = +21.0, Z = 2.27) and a large nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations ~ -27 bpm at 5–6 AM, Z = -1.30). Resting heart rate is within the study’s lower-moderate range (57.2 bpm, Z = -0.11). On self-report measures, trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 51, Z = 0.96) while depressive symptoms are low-to-mild (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34); physical activity is minimal and the participant reports little napping.

Features that point toward higher (worse) PSQI scores
Several features are consistent with risk for poorer subjective sleep quality. The late median sleep onset (≈02:45 AM) is substantially delayed relative to typical nocturnal schedules and is accompanied by large evening physiological arousal signals (strong positive heart-rate deviations across the 8–11 PM window, Z-scores > 1), both of which are commonly associated with longer sleep latency, perceived sleep difficulty, and worse PSQI. Sleep duration is below the study mean (6 h 32 m, Z = -0.81), placing the participant closer to shorter sleep—another correlate of worse PSQI. Trait anxiety (STAI) shows a moderate positive association with PSQI in the sample (score correlation ≈ 0.40), and this participant’s STAI is elevated (Z = 0.96), increasing the likelihood of sleep complaints. Behavioral factors that often degrade sleep (low regular exercise, higher evening screen/TV time) are present: the participant reports no regular exercise (large negative Z-scores) and above-average TV/video use (Z = 1.28), which can lengthen latency or fragment sleep. Finally, low self-esteem and lower health satisfaction (RSES Z = -1.43; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95) align with modest risk for worse subjective sleep in this population.

Features that point toward lower (better) PSQI scores
Several physiological and behavioral indicators suggest partial protection against poor sleep. The participant’s circadian rhythm is relatively well-structured: high interdaily stability (Z = 1.74) and above-average amplitude (Z = 1.16) indicate consistent daily timing and clear day–night separation of physiological arousal, features that tend to support consolidated sleep and lower PSQI. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and in sleep start times is relatively low (both Z ≈ -1), which usually reduces the risk of perceived sleep problems compared with highly irregular sleepers. The wearable also shows an intact and sizable nocturnal heart-rate reduction (large negative deviations overnight), and resting heart rate is not elevated—both consistent with preserved nocturnal physiology. The participant reports essentially no napping (Z ≈ -0.86), which reduces the likelihood of sleep fragmentation or reduced sleep drive at night. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D Z = -0.34), and because CES-D correlates fairly strongly with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.49), the low CES-D score is a protective factor.

Balanced interpretation and overall sleep-quality judgment relative to the study population
Weighing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile: robust circadian entrainment and low variability in sleep timing/duration are protective, but a chronically late bedtime, somewhat short total sleep time, elevated trait anxiety, and pronounced evening physiological arousal are risk factors for worse subjective sleep. Given the moderate-to-strong sample-level associations of anxiety and evening arousal with PSQI, and the participant’s combination of elevated trait anxiety and late sleep onset, the net pattern is more consistent with greater subjective sleep disturbance than with superior sleep. Therefore, on balance the participant’s overall sleep quality—as inferred from the multimodal data—is likely above the study sample’s mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average). This judgment takes into account the participant’s protective circadian regularity, which may attenuate but does not fully counterbalance the risks associated with late sleep timing and elevated anxiety. 

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation
Correlations between individual metrics and PSQI in the sample are generally modest, so conclusions are probabilistic rather than definitive. The strongest sample-level predictors in the dataset (e.g., CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI) and the participant’s elevated anxiety and late sleep timing drive the inference toward above-average PSQI; however, objective circadian robustness and low variability reduce the likelihood of severe sleep disruption."
79341,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable data show a consistent, entrained circadian profile with relatively high interdaily stability (z = 0.91) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (z = 0.98), and a clear daytime heart‑rate peak (acrophase ~4:54 PM) with an expected deep nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–5:00 AM). Resting heart rate (48.3 bpm; z = −1.18) and mesor (64.2 bpm; z = −1.32) are both lower than the study mean, consistent with low baseline cardiovascular arousal. Sleep behavior derived from the device indicates a median sleep duration of 6 h 46 min (z = −0.51), a late median sleep‑start time (about 01:50 AM), modest night‑to‑night variability in start time (SD ≈ 68 min; z = −0.32) and little to no napping (z = −0.86). Together, these objective features portray a robust circadian organization and low nocturnal physiological arousal, but a habitual pattern of relatively short, late-timed sleep.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context: Self‑report measures show low-to-moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 10; z ≈ −0.34) and average trait anxiety (STAI = 41; z ≈ −0.03). Perceived stress is lower than the sample mean (PSS z ≈ −1.8), self‑esteem is slightly above average, and current self‑reported happiness is relatively low (z ≈ −1.61). Health behaviors that typically support sleep are prominent: regular exercise (exercising alone ≥3×/week; z = 1.07), no reported alcohol or recreational drug use, and no daytime napping. Leisure patterns include higher-than-average time spent on video games and modest TV/video use, which can be relevant to evening arousal and sleep timing.

Evidence pointing toward higher PSQI (worse sleep quality): The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:50 AM) and median nightly duration is somewhat short (≈6 h 46 min), both of which are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and higher PSQI scores. Current low self‑reported happiness (z ≈ −1.61) is correlated in the sample with worse PSQI and may reflect negative affective experience that contributes to poorer subjective sleep. Modest evening screen‑based activity (e.g., elevated video‑game time) may also promote later bedtimes or pre‑sleep arousal. Finally, some wearable-derived features that modestly correlate with PSQI in this sample (e.g., variability in sleep duration and sleep start; correlations ≈ 0.18–0.20) are non-zero and the participant shows enough variability to be relevant.

Evidence pointing toward lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Multiple protective factors suggest better-than-average sleep quality. The participant shows strong circadian regularity (high interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation), low nocturnal physiological arousal (deep nocturnal heart‑rate troughs, low mesor, low resting HR), and consistent daytime peaks — patterns typically associated with consolidated sleep and restorative nights. Behavioral supports include regular exercise (z = 1.07), absence of alcohol or drug use, and absence of daytime napping, all of which are associated with better sleep quality in the literature and in the study correlations (exercise correlations with PSQI are negative). Additionally, depressive symptoms and perceived stress are below the sample mean, which reduces risk for elevated PSQI given the positive correlations between depression/anxiety and PSQI in the sample.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the participant combines several robust protective features (regular circadian structure, low resting physiological arousal, regular exercise, low stress and depression, no substance use) with a notable behavioral risk profile limited largely to late sleep timing and somewhat short nightly sleep duration. On net, the pattern is more consistent with somewhat better subjective sleep quality than the average study participant, despite the late bedtimes. Therefore, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI that is below the population mean (i.e., indicating better sleep than the sample average of 6.73), though not without specific targets for improvement (earlier sleep timing and modestly increased nightly duration)."
83536,"Summary of key behavioral and physiological findings: Wearable data indicate a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 7 hours 5 minutes (Z = -0.13), with low frequency of daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Sleep timing is late and somewhat variable: median sleep start ~02:25 AM with a sleep-start SD of ~99 minutes (Z = 0.35). Circadian-summary metrics from heart rate are broadly near the study average for rhythm regularity (interdaily stability = 0.41, Z ≈ 0.0) but show modestly elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.65, Z = 0.74). Cosinor features show a typical acrophase (~5:12 PM), a mesor ~74 bpm (Z = 0.04) and a modest amplitude (10.55, Z = -0.07); resting heart rate is relatively low (56.4 bpm, Z = -0.21). Self-report trait and symptom measures are generally favorable: low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D Z = -0.97; STAI Z = -1.51), high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction (Happiness Z = 1.64; Health satisfaction Z = 1.3), minimal substance use and limited napping.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The participant’s late habitual sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:25 AM) and measurable variability in sleep-start time are features commonly associated with worse subjective sleep quality; both timing lateness and variability show positive associations with PSQI in the dataset (sleep-start SD correlation ≈ 0.18; sleep-duration SD correlation ≈ 0.20). Elevated intradaily variability (IV Z = 0.74) suggests less consolidated rest–activity structure across the day, which can reflect circadian fragmentation or irregular schedules that tend to increase sleep complaints. Behavioral patterns that could contribute to poorer nighttime consolidation—extended evening activities such as prolonged music listening (listening-to-music Z = 2.06) and relatively low exercise frequency (exercising 1–2×/week)—also align modestly with higher PSQI in the cohort. Taken together, these timing- and rhythm-related indicators point to circadian/timing influences that could raise subjective sleep disturbance despite adequate total sleep duration.

Evidence pointing toward relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Objective and self-report indicators that typically predict better sleep are present. Median sleep duration is about 7 hours, close to recommended ranges and near study-average sleep time (Z = -0.13), and daytime napping is essentially absent (napping Z = -0.86), both of which reduce common contributors to poor sleep. Low depressive and anxiety symptom burden (CES-D and STAI well below study means) is strongly protective: these scales correlate positively with PSQI in the sample, so the participant’s low scores argue for fewer sleep complaints. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.4 bpm) and overall interdaily stability is average, indicating a reasonably preserved 24-hour cardiovascular pattern. Low substance use and high health satisfaction and happiness further support comparatively lower levels of sleep disruption in subjective reports.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows a mix of protective and risk features. Protective features—adequate nightly duration, minimal napping, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, low resting HR, and limited substance use—are substantial and are generally associated with lower PSQI scores in this sample. Risk features are primarily timing- and regularity-related (late median sleep onset and elevated intradaily variability), which are associated with higher PSQI but are of moderate magnitude here. Considering the relative sizes of these effects, the overall pattern is most consistent with sleep quality near the study population average, tending slightly better than average. In other words, inferred sleep quality is near the population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73) and likely modestly below that mean (i.e., modestly better sleep than the sample average), rather than markedly worse.

Practical focus areas to reduce residual risk: If the goal is to lower PSQI further, prioritizing stabilization of sleep timing (narrowing the sleep-start variability and advancing habitual sleep onset where feasible), increasing regular daytime activity or exercise, and reducing late-evening stimulating activities could address the main identifiable risk contributors in the data."
67608,"Nightly sleep measures and self-reported sleep-related behavior paint a mixed but overall favorable picture. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 12 minutes (Z = 0.02), which is within the range typically associated with adequate restorative sleep and generally predictive of lower PSQI scores. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD = 58 minutes, Z = -0.98) and sleep start times are both consistently late (median start 01:13:59) and unusually stable (start-time SD = 26 minutes, Z = -1.24). Low nap frequency (mean daily naps 0.12, Z = 0.61) also reduces the likelihood that daytime sleep is fragmenting nocturnal sleep. Together, these objective and self-reported timing/duration indices support reasonably good overall sleep quantity and consistency, notwithstanding the late clock hour of sleep onset.

Psychological, behavioral and lifestyle measures mostly favor better sleep quality. The participant reports very low depressive (CES-D = 1, Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety symptoms (STAI = 26, Z = -1.51), above-average happiness (Z = 1.64) and elevated self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.96); each of these survey variables is associated in this sample with lower PSQI scores (correlations in the expected directions). Frequent physical activity (exercising alone three+ times per week, exercise-related Z-scores ≈ 1.0) and a healthy BMI (23.05) are additional behaviors commonly linked with better sleep. Alcohol use at the frequency reported (1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 1.0) is a modest risk factor but its sample correlation with PSQI is small, so it appears unlikely to be a dominant contributor to poor sleep for this individual.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features show both protective and risk-relevant signals. The participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (53.6 bpm, Z = -0.54), and there is a robust nocturnal decline in mean heart rate (large negative deviations from the mesor across the 1–6 AM window), which is consistent with preserved nocturnal physiological down-regulation and supports restorative sleep. Conversely, intradaily variability is elevated (IV = 0.77, Z = 1.58), indicating relatively greater fragmentation of activity/heart-rate patterns within days; elevated IV is commonly associated with worse sleep quality. Several evening hours show pronounced positive deviations from the mesor (notably 8–9 PM: +22.8, Z = 2.32; 10–11 PM: +15.9, Z = 1.49), suggesting higher evening physiological arousal or activity in the hours preceding this individual’s typical sleep onset. The participant’s interdaily stability is modestly above average (IS = 0.48, Z = 0.58), and cosinor-derived amplitude and MESOR are not extreme, indicating a generally present but slightly attenuated circadian rhythm in heart rate.

Balancing the evidence: likely contributors to higher PSQI (poorer sleep) in this case include the late habitual bedtime (median ~01:14), elevated evening heart-rate deviations suggesting pre-sleep physiological activation, and a relatively high intradaily variability (Z = 1.58) that may reflect fragmented daytime structure. Contributors to lower PSQI (better sleep) include adequate total sleep time, low night-to-night variability, consistent sleep timing (albeit late), strong psychological well-being (low depression/anxiety, high happiness and self-esteem), frequent exercise, and a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate drop supported by a low resting heart rate. On balance, the preponderance of objective sleep quantity/stability measures and positive psychological/lifestyle indicators outweigh the specific circadian fragmentation and evening-arousal signals.

Relative to the study sample (population PSQI mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the combined pattern is most consistent with sleep quality at or somewhat better than average. In other words, the participant’s inferred PSQI is likely below the population mean (better sleep quality than the sample mean), although the late sleep timing and signs of evening physiological activation represent clear targets for improvement if the goal is to optimize sleep health or daytime functioning."
19735,"Overall synthesis: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of protective and risk features for sleep quality, but on balance the data are more consistent with sleep complaints that are at least slightly worse than the study population average. Strong contributors to a higher PSQI score include markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 34, Z = 2.15) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56), both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40). These affective risk factors, together with a late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:01) and reasonably high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 112 minutes), imply disrupted or irregular sleep patterns that commonly map onto poorer subjective sleep quality. Given these strong affective predictors, the participant’s inferred PSQI level is likely above the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73); phrasing conservatively, their overall sleep quality appears near to slightly above the study mean (i.e., worse than average).

Evidence indicating relatively higher PSQI (poorer sleep):
- Affect and stress: The participant reports clinically elevated depressive symptoms and elevated trait anxiety, two of the strongest survey correlates of PSQI in this dataset. Depression score shows one of the largest Z deviations in the battery (Z = 2.15) and is associated with worse PSQI in the sample; this is a robust indicator of increased sleep disturbance risk.  
- Late and irregular timing: Median sleep onset near 02:00 (very late relative to typical sleep windows) combined with a sizable SD in sleep duration (112 minutes) suggests circadian misalignment and inconsistent sleep opportunity, both of which increase the likelihood of poorer subjective sleep. Sleep start-time variability also shows a positive association with PSQI.  
- Behavioral risk exposures: Regular weekly alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week) and a relatively elevated index for recreational drug use (1–2×/month; Z ≈ 3.52) are present. Although correlations with PSQI are modest in the sample, these behaviors can disturb sleep continuity or timing and therefore plausibly contribute to worse subjective sleep for this individual.  
- Psychosocial isolation: The participant reports very low socializing and limited daily recreational activities (e.g., socializing 15 minutes or less; internet use minimal), which may reflect lifestyle patterns that contribute to irregular schedules and reduced daytime structure—factors associated with worse sleep.

Evidence indicating relatively lower PSQI (better sleep):
- Adequate sleep duration: Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 48 minutes (Z ≈ 0.77), which is within the range usually considered sufficient for restorative sleep. Average sleep length at the group level would be protective against severe PSQI elevations.  
- Objective circadian robustness and physiological downregulation: Cosinor-derived amplitude is relatively high (Amplitude Z ≈ 1.13) and interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.42), indicating a reasonably strong day–night amplitude in heart-rate rhythms. The participant’s resting heart rate is low (50.3 bpm, Z ≈ -0.93), and hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough (large negative deviations across ~2–8 AM), consistent with effective overnight autonomic downregulation. These physiological signatures often accompany consolidated sleep and are typically associated with better objective sleep continuity.  
- Low daytime sedentary stimulation from screens: The participant reports little to no time spent on TV, video games, and minimal internet use during the day—this could reduce late-evening screen exposure for some people, which can be sleep-protective.

Circadian and physiological nuance: The heart-rate acrophase at ~5:26 PM and the pattern of elevated daytime heart-rate deviations versus a deep early-morning trough indicate a shifted but still robust circadian profile—an evening-oriented timing rather than a flattened rhythm. However, the autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.21, Z ≈ -0.95), suggesting some inconsistency in daily timing across the recording period; this matches the behavioral evidence of late and variable bedtimes. There is one physiologic hint of late-night arousal: hourly heart-rate deviations around midnight (12–1 AM) trend slightly positive versus the nocturnal nadir, which could reflect transient physiological activation during the late evening/early night for this participant and may align with the documented ~2 AM bedtimes.

Holistic conclusion and comparative statement: Balancing the objective and subjective signals, the participant shows both strengths (adequate average sleep duration, robust day–night heart-rate amplitude, low resting heart rate) and clear liabilities (marked depressive symptoms, elevated anxiety, very late sleep timing, and substantial night-to-night variability). Given the relatively large effect sizes of affective symptoms in relation to PSQI in this dataset and the participant’s extreme CES-D elevation, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely somewhat worse than the study population average. In summary: inferred sleep quality is near to above the population mean PSQI (i.e., somewhat poorer than average), driven primarily by affective disturbance and late/irregular sleep timing despite physiologic signs of preserved nocturnal downregulation and adequate average sleep duration."
59207,"Summary of features that point toward relatively poorer sleep quality:
- Sleep timing and variability: The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (approximately 01:35 AM) and the standard deviation of sleep-start times is elevated (≈141 minutes, Z ≈ 1.27). The standard deviation of nightly sleep duration is also large (169 minutes, Z ≈ 1.55). Both of these variability metrics have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (sleep-start SD ≈ 0.18, duration SD ≈ 0.20), indicating that irregular and inconsistent sleep timing and highly variable night-to-night duration are features typically associated with higher (worse) PSQI scores.  
- Behavioral contributors that commonly degrade sleep: Regular alcohol use at a level of 1–2 beers per week (Z ≈ 1.01) and extended evening/late-night screen-based leisure (video games reported at a high level, Z ≈ 2.47; internet use Z ≈ 0.85) are present; these behaviors are plausibly contributors to later bedtimes and timing variability and therefore to worse subjective sleep.  
- Some physiological signals marginally consistent with higher PSQI: resting heart rate is slightly above the study mean (61.4 bpm, Z ≈ 0.39) and several early-night/late-night hourly heart-rate deviations show small positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., 2–4 AM hourly deviations have correlations up to ~0.23). Although the absolute nocturnal heart-rate reductions are large (see below), these small correlations suggest nocturnal physiology and cardiac arousal patterns may play a modest role in subjective sleep complaints for people in this sample.

Summary of features that point toward relatively better sleep quality:
- Adequate median sleep quantity and low napping: Median sleep duration is long (≈8 hours 13 minutes, Z ≈ 1.28) and mean daily naps are essentially zero (Z ≈ -0.86). Sufficient nightly duration and lack of compensatory daytime napping are characteristics typically associated with lower (better) PSQI scores (the observed correlation between median duration and PSQI in the sample is small, ≈ 0.05).  
- Robust circadian organization and low fragmentation: Heart-rate circadian measures indicate a well-structured rhythm — interdaily stability is relatively high (0.56, Z ≈ 1.24), amplitude is above average (14.04, Z ≈ 1.05), autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Z ≈ 0.81), and intradaily variability is particularly low (0.25, Z ≈ -2.08). These non‑parametric and parametric circadian metrics together suggest consistent day-to-day timing and low within-day fragmentation of physiological activity, features that are usually protective for sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality.  
- Nighttime physiology consistent with sleep consolidation: Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal dip (largest negative deviations from mesor around ~3–7 AM, on the order of −15 to −21 bpm), which is consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and normal nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation. This pattern generally aligns with physiologically restorative sleep.  
- Psychological and lifestyle strengths: Self-report measures show relatively low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, Z ≈ -0.34) and lower trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z ≈ -0.43); both CES-D and STAI scores have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D ≈ 0.49; STAI ≈ 0.40), so the participant’s low scores on these measures are protective against poor subjective sleep. Frequent exercise (exercising alone three times/week or more; Z ≈ 1.07) and high health satisfaction (6/7, Z ≈ 1.3) are additional factors that typically relate to better sleep.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
Taken together, the data present a mixed but coherent picture: objective physiology and circadian structure are generally favorable (adequate total sleep time, strong amplitude and stability of heart-rate rhythms, marked nocturnal heart-rate dip, no daytime napping), while behavioral timing and regularity are notable liabilities (very late median bedtime and sizable night-to-night variability in both sleep timing and duration), along with some evening leisure patterns and modest alcohol use that could sustain later and less consistent sleep schedules. Psychological symptoms that strongly predict worse PSQI in this sample (depressive and anxiety symptoms) are relatively low for this participant, which is a protective factor.

Balancing these factors, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s overall sleep quality is near the study population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16). The participant exhibits both substantive protective markers that would drive PSQI lower (better sleep) and clear risk factors for worse subjective sleep (timing irregularity and late sleep onset). Given the strengths in circadian regularity and sleep quantity but the notable timing variability and late bedtime, a PSQI close to the sample mean — rather than distinctly better or worse — is the most consistent conclusion from the available multimodal evidence.

Caveats:
- Correlations provided are sample-level associations and modest in magnitude for many metrics; individual-level inference of a numeric PSQI should be made cautiously.  
- The hourly heart-rate deviations are temporally aggregated averages and cannot substitute for night-by-night assessments of awakenings or sleep architecture."
96613,"Summary and overall comparison to the study sample
The multimodal data indicate that this participant’s pattern of sleep and circadian physiology is more consistent with relatively good sleep than with poor sleep. Relative to the study sample (population mean PSQI = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the balance of objective and self-report evidence suggests an overall sleep-quality level that is below the population mean PSQI (i.e., likely better-than-average sleep). This conclusion is probabilistic and qualified by the absence of a direct PSQI score in the dataset and by the mixed signals noted below.

Evidence pointing toward relatively good sleep (factors likely to lower PSQI)
Several robust indicators from the wearable and survey data support comparatively good sleep quality. Nightly objective sleep is long: the median sleep duration is 8 hours 29 minutes (Z = +1.61), substantially above the study mean. Sleep timing is consistent: the standard deviation of sleep start time is 34 minutes (Z = −1.06), indicating relatively stable bedtimes across the recording period. Napping is minimal (mean daily naps = 0.15, though Z = +0.94 reflects sample distribution), and sleep-duration variability is not elevated (SD = 77 minutes, Z = −0.53), both of which reduce the likelihood of fragmented or irregular total sleep. Circadian physiology also favors good sleep: amplitude from cosinor analysis is relatively high (14.68, Z = +1.26) and the overnight trough in aggregate heart rate is large (hourly deviations around −24 to −26 bpm in the pre-dawn hours), implying a strong day–night contrast in autonomic state. Resting heart rate is low (47.8 bpm, Z = −1.23), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower nocturnal arousal. Mental-health measures tend to be favorable (CES-D = 7, STAI trait = 34; both below sample mean), and the participant reports high health satisfaction (Z = +1.05) and elevated self-esteem (Z = +0.96), all of which are commonly associated with healthier sleep patterns. Together these features point toward characteristics that would typically reduce PSQI scores.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep (factors that could raise PSQI)
There are warrantable signals that could increase sleep disturbance or subjective sleep complaints. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 01:31 AM), which, despite being regular, can be associated with circadian misalignment or increased daytime consequences for some individuals. Heart rate is modestly elevated around the late-night/early-midnight hour (12–1am deviation +4.75 bpm, Z = +0.94), suggesting some pre-sleep physiological activation at a time when lower arousal would be expected. Nonzero intradaily variability (0.64, Z = +0.67) indicates greater fragmentation of the heart rate rhythm within days, which can co-occur with sleep disruption. Behavioral factors that can impair sleep quality are present but not extreme: alcohol consumption of beer 1–2 times per week (Z = +1.01) and engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z = +1.41) could adversely affect sleep continuity or perceived sleep quality in some contexts. Importantly, the correlations between many of these metrics and PSQI in the study are small or inconsistent, so each of these factors should be interpreted as a potential, not definitive, contributor to worse subjective sleep.

Integrated interpretation and caveats
Balancing the evidence, the data most strongly emphasize long and regular sleep duration, pronounced circadian amplitude and night–day heart-rate contrast, low resting heart rate, and generally favorable mood/stress metrics. These features collectively point toward a lower (better) PSQI score relative to the study mean. Countervailing concerns—late habitual bedtime, modest pre-sleep arousal in heart-rate data, some circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability), and weekly alcohol use—are present but appear secondary in magnitude to the positive indicators. Limitations that temper confidence in the inference include the absence of an actual PSQI score in the dataset, the reliance on aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations (which do not resolve night-to-night variability), and the modest size of many PSQI correlations reported in the sample. If clinical or research decisions depend on a precise assessment of subjective sleep quality or daytime functioning, direct administration of the PSQI and targeted questions about sleep latency, nighttime awakenings, sleep efficiency, and daytime impairment would be recommended."
50766,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of features that, on balance, point to generally preserved physiological sleep consolidation and circadian regularity but a late sleep timing that could contribute to some subjective or social sleep-related impairment. Wearable-derived circadian measures (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high 24-hour autocorrelation and a relatively large amplitude) and clear nocturnal heart‑rate suppression are the strongest signals of consistent, restorative nocturnal physiology. By contrast, the participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:27 AM), which is the main behavioral factor that may push sleep quality scores upward. Psychological self-report (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, modest perceived stress, high health satisfaction and self‑esteem) largely supports lower symptom burden that would be expected to accompany better sleep.

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep (factors that would tend to raise PSQI):
- Late habitual sleep timing: median sleep start time is 01:27:15. Late sleep onset and evening chronotype behaviors are commonly associated with difficulties with daytime functioning and some PSQI subcomponents (sleep latency, daytime dysfunction), even when total sleep duration is adequate.  
- Some substance and social habits: weekly beer consumption (1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.01) and occasional recreational-drug use (less than 1–2×/month; Z ≈ 1.61) are present; while correlations to PSQI in this sample are small, these behaviors can contribute to fragmented or less restorative sleep for some individuals.  
- Later sleep timing could interact with daily obligations and social schedules to create perceived sleep problems not captured by wearables; the available correlations show small positive associations between variability measures and PSQI (e.g., sleep-duration SD correlation ≈ 0.20), so any nights with shorter sleep could disproportionately affect subjective quality.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep (factors that would tend to lower PSQI):
- Adequate and stable sleep duration: median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 29 minutes (Z = 0.37), which meets commonly recommended ranges and is generally associated with lower PSQI scores. Sleep-duration variability is near the sample mean (SD ≈ 100 minutes, Z ≈ -0.03), and sleep-start variability is below average (SD 54 minutes, Z ≈ -0.63), indicating relatively consistent sleep length and timing from night to night.  
- Strong circadian organization: interdaily stability = 0.58 (Z = 1.41), autocorrelation at 24h = 0.51 (Z = 1.57), amplitude = 15.81 (Z = 1.63), and low intradaily variability (0.38; Z = -1.16) together indicate a robust and regular circadian pattern in heart-rate–based physiology. In this dataset these measures trend toward associations with better PSQI (negative correlations or near-zero correlations), so they are protective signals for sleep quality.  
- Consolidated nocturnal physiology: aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced reductions in heart rate across the overnight window (e.g., nadir reductions ~-20 to -23 bpm between ~3:00–6:00 AM), consistent with sustained physiological rest and less fragmentation. Resting heart rate (58.1 bpm) and mesor are within favorable ranges.  
- Low daytime napping (mean daily naps ≈ 0.12, modest Z = 0.61) and low reported stress and mood symptom burden (CES‑D = 11, STAI‑Trait = 37, perceived stress score = 19, with negative Z‑scores relative to the sample) also align with lower subjective sleep disturbance.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study sample mean PSQI: Taking the patterns together — physiologically robust circadian rhythm, consolidated nocturnal heart-rate suppression, sufficient median sleep duration, low psychiatric symptom burden and relatively consistent night‑to‑night timing — the balance of evidence favors overall sleep quality that is at least as good as, and likely modestly better than, the average participant in this sample. Accordingly, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is below the study sample mean PSQI score of 6.72 (i.e., indicating better-than-average sleep quality). The principal countervailing factor is the late habitual sleep onset (~1:27 AM), which could raise subjective complaints related to sleep timing, daytime dysfunction, or social jetlag despite preserved physiological sleep consolidation.

Caveats: Wearable-derived metrics provide strong information about physiological consolidation but are limited in detecting brief awakenings, subjective sleep satisfaction, and domain-specific PSQI components (e.g., sleep medication use, daytime dysfunction). Correlations between individual predictors and PSQI in the study are generally small, so inferences should be considered probabilistic rather than definitive. If the goal is to clarify sources of any residual subjective sleep disturbance, targeted assessment of sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings, daytime functioning, and the impact of late sleep timing on daytime responsibilities would be useful."
71089,"Objective wearable and sleep-timing metrics indicate a generally consolidated and regular sleep pattern. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 8 hours 12 minutes (Z = 1.26), with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 63 minutes, Z = -0.85) and a tightly clustered sleep onset time (median start ≈ 00:50, start-time SD = 39 minutes, Z = -0.96). Circadian rhythm measures derived from heart rate show above-average interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33) and elevated 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.23), while intradaily variability is below the sample mean (0.43, Z = -0.81). The hourly aggregated heart-rate profile shows the expected nocturnal decline (negative deviations from mesor through the overnight hours) and an afternoon acrophase at ~4:34 PM. Together, these objective features are consistent with consolidated, relatively regular nocturnal sleep and a stable circadian pattern—factors typically associated with lower (better) PSQI scores.

Several features of the psychobehavioral profile point in the opposite direction and are associated in the study with poorer subjective sleep quality. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28) and higher trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46); in this sample these measures correlate moderately with PSQI (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), so they represent a notable risk for worse perceived sleep. Low self-esteem (RSES score 27, Z = -1.57) and relatively low satisfaction with physical health (Z = -1.45) also align with PSQI-relevant risk (self-esteem correlation with PSQI ≈ -0.36). Behavioral patterns that could negatively impact sleep include very low reported exercise (frequency “not at all,” Zs between about -1.1 and -1.9) and relatively high evening/total screen-based and sedentary recreation (internet and music use Z ≈ 1.5–1.6). Physiologically, mean heart-rate level (mesor = 86.9, Z = 1.77) and resting heart rate (71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55) are elevated relative to the sample; modest positive correlations between resting HR and PSQI (r ≈ 0.12) and between some overnight heart-rate deviations and PSQI suggest a possible contribution of physiological arousal to worse sleep perception for this individual.

Balancing the objective and subjective indicators yields a mixed but interpretable picture. Objectively, the participant’s long median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, consistent sleep timing, and strong circadian regularity are protective features that are typically associated with lower PSQI scores. Conversely, elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low physical activity, high evening/sedentary screen use, and an elevated average heart rate are factors that—based on their study correlations and known relationships with sleep—would tend to increase likelihood of worse subjective sleep quality. Given the relative magnitudes in the dataset (strong objective regularity and sufficient sleep duration versus moderate psychological risk signals with moderate correlations to PSQI), the overall balance leans toward objectively better-than-average sleep but with a meaningful risk that subjective sleep quality could be degraded by mood/anxiety and physiological arousal.

Compared to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile most consistently predicts a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., comparatively better sleep) on objective metrics, although psychological symptom burden and elevated resting heart rate raise the possibility that self-reported sleep quality could be closer to sample average or worse than objective indicators suggest. In other words: objective wearable and timing data point to sleep quality below (better than) the study mean, but psychological and physiological risk factors warrant attention because they could pull the participant’s subjective PSQI score upward toward or above the population average."
22688,"Summary — data and analytic focus: The available self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived metrics portray a participant with generally favorable mental-health and sleep behaviors alongside some blunting of circadian structure in heart-rate rhythms. I focus on features that, based on their direction and magnitude (Z-scores) and known relationships to PSQI, would tend to push the PSQI higher (worse sleep) and those that would push it lower (better sleep), then provide a balanced overall interpretation relative to the study sample mean PSQI (6.73).

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (factors that would tend to increase PSQI): Several circadian summary metrics indicate reduced circadian robustness. Interdaily stability is low (0.27; Z = -1.15) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is markedly low (Z = -1.79), and cosine amplitude is below the sample mean (amplitude 8.75; Z = -0.66). These low values suggest weaker day-to-day consistency and a blunted heart-rate rhythm, features that are often associated with greater sleep complaints and elevated PSQI in population studies. The participant’s bedtime is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 00:33), which in some contexts is linked with poorer subjective sleep quality even when total duration is sufficient. Weekly alcohol consumption (beer/wine/liquor 1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.0) is above the sample median and has a small positive correlation with PSQI; this level of use could contribute modestly to fragmented or lower-quality sleep. Finally, resting heart rate is slightly above the sample mean (60.4 bpm; Z = 0.27) and shows small positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset, a signal that can sometimes reflect physiological arousal or lower parasympathetic tone accompanying poorer sleep.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep quality (factors that would tend to decrease PSQI): Multiple strong indicators point toward good sleep. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is long relative to the sample (8 h 2 min; Z = 1.05), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep start time is lower than average (duration SD 78 min, Z = -0.51; start-time SD 47 min, Z = -0.79). Mean daily naps are zero (Z = -0.86), consistent with consolidated nocturnal sleep. Wearable-derived nocturnal heart-rate deviations show a pronounced, sustained nocturnal dip (hourly deviations reach about -15 to -19 bpm across the 2–6 AM window), a pattern typically seen with physiologically restorative sleep. Self-report measures show low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5; Z = -0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 27; Z = -1.41), along with relatively high self-esteem and current happiness (RSES Z = 1.1; happiness Z = 1.64) and good health satisfaction (Z = 1.22). The participant reports regular group exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more; Z = 1.23) and minimal recreational or non-prescribed drug use; these psychosocial and behavioral factors are consistently associated with better subjective sleep.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the sample mean PSQI: Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most direct indicators of sleep quality for this participant are objective sleep duration (consistently >8 hours), low night-to-night variability, absence of naps, and robust nocturnal heart-rate reduction — all of which strongly favor lower (better) PSQI scores. The primary countervailing signals are reduced circadian stability and amplitude in heart-rate measures and a relatively late bedtime; these raise some concern about circadian irregularity that can increase sleep complaints, but their magnitude (Z-scores modest to moderate) and the weak correlations to PSQI in this dataset suggest they are secondary. Considering the balance of effects, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being below the population mean PSQI (i.e., better sleep quality than the sample average of 6.73). In other words, the composite multimodal profile points toward somewhat better-than-average sleep quality in this sample.

Important caveats: Correlations provided in the dataset are modest and do not determine causality. The circadian heart-rate metrics are aggregated across days and cannot resolve day-to-day variability or specific nocturnal events; they also may reflect behavioral timing (work, exercise, meals) as well as endogenous rhythm. Self-reports and wearable measures sometimes diverge; here they are generally concordant but should be interpreted together rather than taken as definitive. If a detailed clinical or intervention decision is required, additional targeted assessment (sleep diary, clinical PSQI score, polysomnography for suspected sleep disorders, or a longer wearable record assessing day-to-day phase relationships) would strengthen inference."
38815,"Summary and overall impression:
The wearable and survey data portray a participant who typically obtains an adequate quantity of sleep but shows signs of irregular timing and some behavioral and psychological features that can degrade subjective sleep quality. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 3 minutes (Z = -0.16), and naps are infrequent (mean daily naps 0.12, Z = 0.61). Sleep onset is relatively late (median start ~00:50). Circadian analysis of heart rate shows a clear day–night difference (amplitude 12.6, Z = 0.58) with an acrophase in the early evening (5:55 PM) and strong overnight reductions in heart rate (hourly deviations from mesor of roughly -18 to -24 bpm between ~2:00–7:00 AM), indicating consolidated physiological rest during the usual sleep window. Taken together, the objective indices suggest physiologically consolidated sleep episodes of reasonable average duration, but timing irregularity is present.

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (factors that would tend to increase PSQI):
- Timing irregularity and variability in sleep: sleep duration standard deviation is high (136 minutes, Z = 0.80) and median bedtime is late (~00:50), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in this sample (duration SD r = 0.20; sleep start time SD r = 0.18). Low interdaily stability of the heart-rate circadian rhythm (0.31, Z = -0.82) indicates day-to-day irregularity in rest–activity timing, a pattern linked to worse subjective sleep (interdaily stability r = -0.07 here). Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.56, Z = 0.10), consistent with some fragmentation of behavioral rhythms. 
- Psychological and behavioral risk factors: trait anxiety is above the sample mean (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17), and anxiety shows a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.40). Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 22, Z = 0.10; PSQI correlation r ≈ 0.20). Daily internet use is high (3–4 hours, Z = 1.52) and has a small positive association with PSQI (r ≈ 0.12). Weekly alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week, Z = 1.01) is another behavioral factor that, in population data, can worsen sleep and has a small positive correlation with PSQI here (r ≈ 0.03). Collectively these features point toward a higher subjective sleep disturbance even if objective sleep amount is often adequate.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep quality (factors that would tend to lower PSQI):
- Adequate average sleep duration and physiological consolidation: median sleep duration is close to 7 hours (Z ≈ -0.16), and the wearable heart-rate profile shows strong nocturnal reductions (large negative deviations from mesor overnight), which are characteristic of consolidated, restorative sleep. Mean daily naps are infrequent, reducing the likelihood of daytime compensatory sleep that can fragment nocturnal sleep. 
- Signs of physical fitness and health satisfaction: resting heart rate is relatively low (47.5 bpm, Z = -1.27) and mesor is low (65.9 bpm, Z = -1.10), patterns that often reflect good cardiovascular fitness and are not in themselves indicators of poor objective sleep. The participant reports relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 1.05), and daytime activity amplitude is present (amplitude Z = 0.58), both of which are supportive of overall sleep–wake robustness.

Holistic comparison to the study population mean PSQI:
Balancing the objective strengths (adequate median duration, strong nocturnal heart-rate reduction, low napping) against the risks (late average sleep timing, substantial night-to-night variability, reduced interdaily stability, elevated trait anxiety and modest stress, and behavioral factors such as high evening/Internet use and weekly alcohol), the overall profile suggests sleep quality that is around the study sample mean but tending slightly worse than average. In comparison to the population PSQI mean of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal pattern is best characterized as near the population mean with a modest tilt toward a higher PSQI (i.e., slightly above the mean) rather than substantially better or substantially worse."
72885,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian patterns:
Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 5 hours 59 minutes (Z = -1.50), with a median sleep start time near 03:44 AM and a sleep-onset standard deviation of ~81 minutes. These objective metrics point to short and very late sleep episodes relative to the study sample. Circadian summary features derived from heart rate indicate a relatively low circadian amplitude (amplitude = 7.68, Z = -1.0) and reduced interdaily stability (0.25, Z = -1.32), while the cosinor mesor is modestly below the sample mean (mesor = 68.55, Z = -0.74). Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced elevation above the mesor at 1–2 AM (deviation = +6.66, Z = 2.04) and continued modest positive deviations around midnight–1 AM, with larger negative deviations across the early morning hours (e.g., 5–7 AM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.4 bpm, Z = -0.45).

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context:
Trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) is elevated relative to the sample and is one of the self-report measures with a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in the study data (r ≈ 0.4). Depressive symptom score (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18) is in the non‑depressed range but shows a substantial population-level correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.5). Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES score = 31, Z = -1.01; correlation with PSQI r ≈ -0.35), and social-trust and some health-satisfaction indices are also lower than average. Reported recreational drug use (1–2 times per week) and some evening leisure (video gaming ~1–2 hours, Z = 2.47) are notable behavioral features; population Z-scores for non-prescribed/recreational drug items are highly elevated and suggest this participant is an outlier on those behaviors. Physical activity is infrequent (exercise alone 1–2 times/month; exercising with others not at all).

Evidence suggesting poorer sleep quality (likely to drive a higher PSQI score):
- Short objective sleep duration (~6 hours, Z = -1.50) and very late median sleep onset (~03:44 AM) both map onto components of poor sleep (short total sleep time, late timing/insufficient opportunity).  
- Low interdaily stability and reduced circadian amplitude (Zs ≈ -1.3 and -1.0) indicate weak day-to-day regularity and blunted circadian rhythmicity, which are commonly associated with worse subjective and objective sleep quality.  
- Elevated nighttime heart rate around 1–2 AM (large positive deviation, Z = 2.04) implies nocturnal physiological arousal during a time when the participant is often attempting to sleep; this pattern is plausibly linked to sleep fragmentation or reduced sleep depth.  
- Behavioral and psychological correlates that align with worse sleep: elevated trait anxiety (STAI), notable recreational/non‑prescribed drug use, frequent late-evening screen/game time, low exercise, and lower self‑esteem. Several of these measures (STAI, CES-D) have moderate positive population-level correlations with PSQI in the study, supporting their relevance.

Evidence suggesting relatively better sleep-related factors (likely to lower PSQI or mitigate risk):
- Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.4 bpm, Z = -0.45), which can reflect cardiovascular fitness or relatively low baseline physiological arousal and in some contexts associates with better sleep physiology.  
- Sleep timing variability and sleep-duration variability are not highly elevated relative to the sample (sleep duration SD ≈ 93 minutes, Z ≈ -0.18; sleep-start SD Z ≈ -0.04), indicating that although the timing is late, night-to-night variability is not extreme.  
- Some self-report indicators of well-being are near or above average (self-reported happiness Z ≈ 0.55; perceived stress near the sample mean), and CES-D is below clinical cutoffs; these mixed psychosocial signals could moderate the impact of other risk factors on subjective sleep quality.

Holistic appraisal relative to the study population mean PSQI:
Taking the total pattern together — objectively short sleep duration, very late and delayed sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, nocturnal heart-rate elevation, elevated trait anxiety, and notable recreational drug use — the preponderance of evidence indicates a sleep profile that would likely correspond to a PSQI score above the study sample mean (population mean PSQI = 6.71, SD = 2.15). While there are some mitigating signals (low resting heart rate, modest night-to-night variability, nonclinical depression score), the combination of short sleep, circadian irregularity, nocturnal physiological arousal, and behavioral risk factors makes it likely this participant’s overall sleep quality is worse than average within this sample.

Limitations and uncertainty:
This inference integrates cross-sectional wearable aggregates, self-report scales, and population-level correlations; it cannot substitute for a measured PSQI score and does not establish causality. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations and cosinor metrics reflect typical patterns across the recording period rather than specific nights, and some self-report values (e.g., substance-use Z-scores) are extreme outliers and should be interpreted cautiously."
71193,"Summary integration: The participant presents a mixed multimodal profile. Self-report measures show substantially elevated depressive and trait anxiety symptoms (CES‑D = 39, Z = 2.67; STAI = 60, Z = 1.85), low self‑esteem (RSES = 28, Z = −1.43), low happiness and modestly elevated perceived stress (Happiness Z = −1.61; PSS = 25, Z = 0.92). These psychological features have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40; Self‑esteem r ≈ −0.35), indicating that the participant’s high symptom burden is a substantial risk factor for poorer subjective sleep quality. At the same time, the wearable-derived physiology and sleep timing contain several markers that are typically associated with relatively good sleep physiology: consistent and relatively long nightly sleep (median duration 8 h 2 min, Z = 1.05) with low night-to-night variability (duration SD = 55 min, Z = −1.04), stable sleep onset timing (median start ~01:47, SD Z ≈ −0.93), a robust circadian signal (interdaily stability = 0.60, Z = 1.57; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.54, Z = 1.82), low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.37, Z = −1.24), and a clear nocturnal heart-rate decline with normal resting heart rate (59 bpm, Z = 0.10). These objective markers argue for regular, consolidated sleep physiology despite the late sleep timing.

Evidence favoring higher PSQI (worse subjective sleep):
- Elevated mood and anxiety symptoms are the most salient signals pointing toward poorer subjective sleep. The CES‑D score (39, Z = 2.67) and STAI trait score (60, Z = 1.85) are both well above the study mean and have the largest correlations with PSQI in the dataset (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40). Elevated depressive and anxiety symptomatology commonly amplify sleep complaints (difficulty falling/staying asleep, poorer perceived sleep quality).
- Low self‑esteem and low reported happiness (both substantial negative Z‑scores) also correlate with worse PSQI (self‑esteem r ≈ −0.35; happiness r ≈ −0.27) and therefore contribute additional risk for elevated subjective sleep disturbance.
- Behavioral features that can worsen subjective sleep: relatively little exercise (exercising alone 1–2×/month; communal exercise none), modest daytime naps (mean daily naps 0.19, Z = 1.34), elevated sedentary/video-game time, and low socializing. These lifestyle patterns are weak-to-moderate PSQI correlates in the sample but, in combination with mood symptoms, can maintain or exacerbate perceived sleep problems.

Evidence favoring lower PSQI (better subjective/objective sleep):
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity are generally favorable. Median nightly sleep ~8 h with low variability suggests adequate and consistent total sleep time (Z = 1.05 for duration; SD Z = −1.04). Regularity metrics from heart-rate cosinor and non‑parametric analyses (high interdaily stability, high 24‑h autocorrelation, low intradaily variability) indicate a stable circadian rhythm and low fragmentation—features typically linked with better objective sleep continuity and lower sleep complaints.
- Wearable cardiac data show a physiologically normal nocturnal heart-rate nadir and preserved amplitude of daily heart-rate variation (amplitude Z ≈ 0.96; acrophase ~5:49 PM), consistent with intact autonomic sleep–wake physiology and lowering the likelihood of frequent nocturnal arousals detectable by heart-rate patterns.
- Low use of alcohol and recreational/non-prescribed drugs is a protective behavioral factor for sleep quality.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to study sample mean PSQI: The strongest and most predictive signals in this dataset are the markedly elevated depressive and trait-anxiety scores, both of which have the largest positive correlations with PSQI in the sample. Although objective wearable markers indicate regular, consolidated, and sufficiently long sleep (which would tend to reduce PSQI), the psychological symptom burden is large enough and well-associated with worse PSQI to suggest that the participant’s subjective sleep quality is likely worse than average in this study population. In other words, the balance of evidence supports an inferred PSQI level above the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). Degree of elevation is uncertain from these data alone, but given the magnitude of depressive symptoms (Z ≈ 2.7) and their correlation with PSQI, a moderate-to-substantial elevation above the mean is plausible.

Caveats: Objective sleep physiology (duration and circadian regularity) and low substance use partially mitigate risk and suggest that sleep complaints, if present, may be more related to affective/cognitive factors (mood, worry, rumination) than to highly fragmented or short sleep per se. The late habitual bedtime (~01:47) represents a stable late chronotype rather than irregular timing; this can produce misalignment with daytime demands and contribute to subjective impairment even when total sleep time is adequate. Further assessment that directly measures PSQI score(s), sleep disturbance components (latency, efficiency, daytime dysfunction), and daytime impairment alongside clinical evaluation of mood and anxiety symptoms would clarify the relative contributions of psychological versus physiological factors."
98760,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant shows a mixed profile: psychological symptom scores (depression, trait anxiety, perceived stress) are all below the study mean and indices of positive well‑being (self‑esteem, current happiness) are above the mean, which conventionally predict better subjective sleep. Objectively, heart‑rate–based circadian markers indicate a relatively strong day–night contrast (large nocturnal heart‑rate nadir and a high cosinor amplitude), consistent with consolidated physiological sleep. Offsetting those protective factors are a habitual late sleep onset (median sleep start ≈ 01:58 AM), modestly short median nightly sleep (6 h 52 min), and notable night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 102 minutes). Taken together, the data suggest the participant’s sleep quality is neither clearly excellent nor severely impaired; compared with the study sample (population PSQI mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the overall profile is near the population mean, leaning slightly below the mean (i.e., somewhat better than average) when psychological and circadian health are weighted against late timing and variability.

Features that tend to predict poorer sleep (higher PSQI)
- Late habitual sleep timing: The median sleep start time is approximately 01:58:45 (about 2:00 AM). Late bedtimes and evening circadian misalignment are commonly associated with worse subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction and can elevate PSQI scores.  
- Shorter-than‑recommended median sleep duration: Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 52 minutes (Z = –0.39). Although not extremely short, this is below typical adult recommendations and can contribute to greater sleep complaints.  
- High night‑to‑night variability: Sleep duration standard deviation is large (≈102 minutes), and sleep‑start variability is nontrivial (SD ≈ 65 minutes). Greater intraindividual irregularity in sleep timing/duration is associated with poorer sleep continuity and higher PSQI (correlations in this sample are positive for variability measures).  
- Elevated evening physiological arousal: Aggregate hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced elevations in the early evening and late evening (e.g., +24 to +26 bpm deviations at ~6–9 PM; Z-scores up to ~2.9). Sustained or late-evening physiological arousal could delay sleep onset and reduce subjective sleep quality.  
- Intradaily variability: The intradaily variability metric (0.67, Z ≈ 0.88) is on the higher side relative to the sample; higher intraday fragmentation is often linked to more disturbed rest–activity patterns and worse sleep reports.

Features that tend to predict better sleep (lower PSQI)
- Low mood and anxiety burden: Scores on CES‑D (7.0, Z = –0.66) and STAI‑Trait (33.0, Z = –0.82) are below the sample mean, and perceived stress is low (PSS score 19, Z = –0.71). In this sample these variables correlate positively with PSQI, so the participant’s low symptom levels are protective against poor subjective sleep.  
- Strong circadian amplitude and nocturnal heart‑rate nadir: Cosinor amplitude is relatively high (amplitude = 15.86, Z = 1.64), and aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show substantial nocturnal reductions (e.g., ~–20 to –26 bpm from mesor overnight). These features indicate a robust physiological day–night contrast and consolidated nocturnal rest, which tend to associate with better objective sleep continuity and lower PSQI.  
- Favorable cardiovascular/resting physiology: Resting heart rate is relatively low (~53 bpm, Z ≈ –0.61), and the mesor is not elevated—patterns consistent with good cardiorespiratory fitness and lower baseline arousal, both of which are linked to better sleep.  
- Healthy lifestyle behaviors: The participant reports little to no substance use, exercises three times per week or more (Z ≈ 1.07), and has low nap frequency (mean daily naps ≈ 0.12). These behavioral factors are generally associated with improved sleep quality.  
- Positive psychosocial indicators: High self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ 0.82) and higher current happiness (Z ≈ 1.64) are protective factors that, in this sample, relate to better sleep outcomes.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to sample mean
Balancing risk and protective features yields an intermediate characterization. The strongest risk signals are late habitual sleep timing, meaningful night‑to‑night variability in duration, and elevated evening physiological activation—each plausibly increasing the likelihood of subjective sleep complaints captured by the PSQI. Conversely, low depressive/anxious symptom burden, regular exercise and low substance use, robust circadian amplitude, marked nocturnal heart‑rate declines, and low resting heart rate point toward reasonably consolidated and restorative physiological sleep. Given the relative magnitudes (notably the high circadian amplitude and favorable mental‑health profile versus moderate shortness and irregularity of sleep), the integrated evidence supports an overall sleep quality near the study population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.72). If forced to place the participant relative to that mean, the balance of physiological robustness and favorable psychosocial factors suggests a PSQI at or slightly below the population mean (i.e., sleep quality that is roughly average or modestly better than the sample average), rather than substantially worse.

Practical implications (concise)
- If the participant is concerned about subjective sleep quality, targeting earlier and more consistent bedtimes (reducing the ~2:00 AM median start and lowering night‑to‑night variability) and attenuating late‑evening arousal could produce measurable improvements.  
- Current strengths (low mood/anxiety, exercise, low substance use, robust nocturnal physiology) are supportive and likely buffer against large increases in PSQI; maintaining these behaviors should help preserve sleep quality."
95374,"Summary/overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of risk and protective features for sleep quality. Self-report symptom measures identify elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 28, Z = 1.53) and moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56). Wearable-recorded sleep duration is close to study norms (median 7 h 15 min, Z = 0.09), but there is pronounced night-to-night inconsistency in sleep timing and length (sleep duration SD = 219 min, Z = 2.68; sleep start time SD = 148 min, Z = 1.43) and a very late median sleep onset (03:11 AM). Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a strong amplitude (amplitude Z = 2.06) and reasonably stable daily structure (autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 1.06; interdaily stability modestly above average Z = 0.42), while hourly heart-rate deviations indicate relatively high evening and late-night physiological activity (large positive deviations in the evening and around midnight).

Evidence indicating higher PSQI score (poorer sleep): Several psychosocial and behavioral markers that are correlated with poorer sleep stand out. Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety—both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40)—are present at clinically meaningful levels and are likely to contribute to worse subjective sleep. The participant’s habitual sleep schedule is extremely delayed (median start ~3:11 AM) and irregular (high SDs for start time and for duration), and high variability in sleep timing and duration is associated here with higher PSQI (sleep duration SD correlation ≈ 0.19; sleep start time SD correlation ≈ 0.17). Wearable data show elevated physiological arousal in the evening and around midnight (notable positive deviations from mesor at 7–8 PM, 12–1 AM and small positives at 1–3 AM), consistent with late-night wakefulness or behavioral arousal that can undermine sleep onset and sleep continuity. Higher-than-average nap frequency (mean daily naps 0.22, Z = 1.75) and substantial evening screen-based recreation/video game time (video games Z = 2.47; TV/videos Z = 1.28) further support the presence of behaviors that commonly relate to poorer nocturnal sleep.

Evidence indicating lower PSQI score (better sleep): There are several protective signals that argue against uniformly poor sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is within the normative range (≈7 h 15 min), which is often associated with better restorative sleep when duration is consistent. The participant shows a relatively low resting heart rate (51.4 bpm, Z = -0.8), which can reflect cardiovascular fitness and may be indirectly associated with better sleep physiology. Circadian measures indicate robust day–night structure in heart rate (high amplitude, elevated 24-hour autocorrelation), suggesting an intact and strong circadian signal—this regularity can support consolidated sleep when timing is consistent. Substance use is essentially absent and self-rated health satisfaction is above average, both of which are protective for sleep. Self-esteem is above average (Z ≈ 0.96) and correlates negatively with PSQI in the sample, which could mitigate some subjective sleep disturbance.

Circadian and physiological interpretation: The cosinor and hourly heart-rate patterns describe a pronounced eveningness profile: large positive HR deviations across the evening and into late night, an acrophase in the early evening (≈7:41 PM), and a sizeable amplitude. That pattern, together with the very late median sleep onset, indicates a behavioral schedule shifted toward late-night activity. Although the circadian signal is strong (which can be protective if sleep timing is consistent), the participant’s actual sleep timing is both late and irregular, producing a mismatch between behavioral sleep timing and the potential benefits of a robust circadian rhythm. The evening physiological activation and frequent naps suggest incomplete daytime recovery or fragmented nocturnal sleep despite adequate median duration.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.72): Weighing the evidence, the participant’s profile is more consistent with a PSQI score above the study population mean (i.e., relatively worse sleep quality). The principal drivers of this inference are moderately high depressive and anxiety symptoms (both strongly associated with higher PSQI), a very late and inconsistent sleep schedule (large SDs for sleep start and duration), elevated evening physiological arousal, and above-average napping and evening screen-time. These risk factors outweigh protective features such as adequate median duration, low substance use, low resting heart rate, and a strong circadian amplitude. Note that this inference is probabilistic and based on associations in the sample; it does not replace a direct PSQI measurement or clinical evaluation."
71985,"Objective, wearable-derived indicators point toward generally consolidated and physiologically restorative sleep for this participant. Median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 18 minutes (Z = 0.14), and mean daily naps were essentially nil (Z = -0.86), both of which are consistent with adequate nocturnal sleep opportunity and limited daytime sleep that might fragment nighttime sleep. Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a robust and regular rhythm: interdaily stability is high (0.66, Z = 2.07) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.53, Z = 1.74), indicating day-to-day regularity in physiological rhythms. The cosinor amplitude is above the sample mean (13.91, Z = 1.01) and the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal decreases (large negative deviations overnight, e.g., -21 to -25 bpm across 2–7 AM), with a low resting heart rate (50 bpm, Z = -0.97). Together these features—adequate sleep duration, minimal napping, strong circadian amplitude and stability, and physiologic night-time downregulation—are the most salient objective indicators that would be expected to associate with relatively lower PSQI scores (better sleep quality).

At the same time, several behavioral and self-report features point toward factors that could increase PSQI (poorer subjective sleep). The participant’s median sleep start time is late (00:21) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes, Z = 0.35) and sleep-duration variability is also elevated (SD ≈ 108 minutes, Z = 0.17). Late and irregular bedtimes are known contributors to poorer subjective sleep quality. Evening recreational behavior includes relatively high time spent on video games (1–2 hours; Z = 2.47) and above-average time watching TV/videos (1–2 hours; Z = 1.28), which may extend evening arousal or screen exposure. On self-report instruments, perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) and trait anxiety (STAI = 41, Z = -0.03 but classified as “anxious”) are present at modest levels; depressive symptoms are in the non-clinical range but are positively correlated with PSQI in this sample (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49), and STAI correlates with PSQI at 0.40. These psychological factors, along with the observed bedtime timing/variability and evening screen use, represent the primary signals that would tend to push a PSQI score higher (worse).

Integrating objective and self-report information yields a modestly favorable overall picture of sleep health but with clear areas of vulnerability. The strongest evidence favors relatively good sleep: objective sleep duration is sufficient, daytime napping is minimal, physiological nocturnal quiescence is pronounced, and circadian regularity measures are well above the sample mean—features that typically predict lower PSQI scores. Offsetting that, the participant shows late and somewhat variable bedtimes, notable evening screen-based recreation, and moderate stress/anxiety—factors that empirically correlate with higher PSQI in this sample and may degrade the subjective experience of sleep. Given the balance of evidence, the participant’s overall sleep quality as inferred from these multimodal data is likely below the study sample mean PSQI (i.e., somewhat better sleep quality than the group average of 6.73). This conclusion is probabilistic and inferential (no direct PSQI score was provided here); it relies more heavily on objective circadian regularity and physiologic markers than on the modest self-reported psychosocial risk factors that could nevertheless warrant monitoring."
43125,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of risk and protective indicators for sleep quality. Objective wearable measures indicate a relatively regular, consolidated sleep episode of decent duration (median 7 h 28 min; Z = 0.35) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 72 min, Z = -0.66; sleep start SD = 45 min, Z = -0.82) and limited daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.14, Z = 0.82). Circadian rhythm features derived from heart rate show a pronounced amplitude (14.99; Z = 1.36) and modest interdaily stability (0.44; Z = 0.25) together with relatively low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.49; Z = -0.39). At the same time, psychometric and behavioral data identify several strong risk factors for poorer sleep: markedly elevated depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety (CES-D = 37, Z = 2.47; STAI = 53, Z = 1.16), frequent alcohol use and very high endorsed recreational drug use (beer use Z = 1.72; recreational drugs Z = 5.44), limited physical activity (exercise Z-scores around -1.6 to -1.9), and late habitual sleep onset (median sleep start time = 02:00). Below I detail features that point toward relatively poorer vs. relatively better sleep and then integrate these into an overall comparison to the study population.

Factors indicating higher PSQI score (worse sleep): Psychological symptom burden is a primary concern. The CES-D score is highly elevated (37, Z = 2.47) and the STAI trait score is above average (53, Z = 1.16); these measures have positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40), indicating that higher depressive and anxiety symptoms in this participant are statistically linked to worse self-reported sleep in the study cohort. Substance use patterns (frequent beer use and very high recreational drug use, recreational-drug Z = 5.44) represent additional behavioral risk factors that are plausibly associated with poorer sleep continuity or perceived sleep quality. Evening/night physiology also shows some concerning features: aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated heart rate relative to the mesor around midnight (12–1am deviation +9.9, Z = 1.67; 1–2am +3.0, Z = 1.53) and sustained relatively high evening HR (e.g., 10–11pm and 11–12am with Z ≈ 1.4–1.7). Those elevated late-night HR deviations can reflect delayed sleep onset or nocturnal arousal, which tend to degrade subjective sleep quality even if total time asleep is adequate. Finally, the participant’s late median sleep start (02:00) places sleep timing well into the night; late timing and evening activities (e.g., 1–2 hours TV, elevated video game time) are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep and may contribute to misalignment with daytime demands, thereby worsening PSQI scores.

Factors indicating lower PSQI score (better sleep): Several objective wearable-derived features suggest relatively preserved or robust sleep physiology. Median nightly sleep duration is in the healthy range (7 h 28 min, Z = 0.35) and sleep duration variability is lower than average (SD Z = -0.66), indicating consistent total sleep time. Sleep start time variability is also low (SD 45 min, Z = -0.82), pointing to a stable sleep schedule—even if shifted late—rather than fragmented or highly irregular sleep. Circadian metrics support a well-defined day–night rhythm: amplitude is elevated (Z = 1.36), intradaily variability is below the cohort mean (Z = -0.39), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderately positive (Z = 0.48). The hourly heart-rate profile shows large negative deviations from mesor across the core overnight period (3–9am strongly negative), consistent with consolidated, physiologic nocturnal lowering of cardiovascular activity. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.8 bpm; Z = -0.4), which is often seen in individuals with good cardiovascular fitness and can co-occur with higher sleep efficiency. Low mean daily napping and modest interdaily stability further argue for a regular sleep–wake pattern rather than pervasive fragmentation.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: The data present a meaningful tension. Objective sleep timing and continuity metrics (adequate median duration, low variability, consolidated nocturnal HR dip, robust circadian amplitude) are consistent with relatively preserved physiologic sleep and would tend to predict a lower PSQI (better sleep). In contrast, high internalizing symptoms (CES-D, STAI), frequent substance use (especially very high recreational drug use), late clock time of sleep onset (median 02:00), and indicators of evening physiological arousal argue for worse subjective sleep quality. Given the relatively strong associations between depressive symptoms and PSQI in this sample (CES-D r = 0.49) together with the extreme elevation on the CES-D (Z = +2.47) and the very large recreational drug use Z-score (5.44), the balance of evidence favors an elevated PSQI score relative to the sample mean. Concretely: while objective sleep duration and stability would be expected to place this participant near or below the sample mean PSQI, the magnitude of psychological distress and substance-use risk factors—both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSQI—suggest the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI of 6.71 (i.e., poorer than average in this sample).

Practical implications for interpretation: The pattern suggests someone who obtains a substantial and regular amount of sleep in a late-night schedule but experiences psychological and behavioral factors that likely degrade subjective sleep quality (difficulty falling asleep, night-time arousal, or nonrestorative sleep). If the goal is to reduce PSQI score, interventions targeting mood and anxiety symptoms, reducing evening substance use, and shifting sleep timing earlier (or aligning sleep timing with daytime demands) would be reasonable targets to test empirically. Objective wearable signals (midnight HR elevation, evening HR elevations) could be used as proximal markers to monitor changes in nocturnal arousal with any behavioral or clinical interventions."
98117,"Summary and overall comparison:
Across the multimodal dataset, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s sleep quality is likely worse than the study sample average. Relative to the population PSQI mean of 6.72 (SD 2.16), the pattern of high depressive symptom burden, elevated trait anxiety, extreme instability in sleep timing, and physiological indicators of increased arousal point toward an overall PSQI score above the population mean (i.e., poorer sleep quality than typical in the sample).

Features that point toward poorer sleep quality (likely increase PSQI):
- High affective symptom burden: The participant’s CES-D score (33; Z = 2.05) and STAI–Trait score (53; Z = 1.16) are both well above the sample mean and have relatively strong positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40). This pattern indicates that depressive and anxiety symptoms are salient contributors to worse subjective sleep quality in this participant and in the sample as a whole.  
- Extreme variability and late sleep timing: The median sleep start time near 04:03 AM and very large sleep-start SD (280 minutes; Z = 4.33) together with very high sleep-duration variability (SD = 234 minutes; Z = 3.02) indicate substantial irregularity in when and how long the participant sleeps. These timing irregularities are associated with higher PSQI in the cohort (sleep start SD and duration SD correlations ~0.18–0.20) and are mechanistically consistent with fragmented or non-restorative sleep.  
- Behavioral and lifestyle risk factors: High evening and overall screen use (internet >4 hours, TV 2–3 hours; Z-scores 2.19 and 1.91) and minimal socializing/exercise (socializing Z = –2.20; exercise frequently “not at all”) represent behaviors commonly linked to poorer sleep quality and circadian misalignment; these behaviors also show positive (albeit modest) correlations with PSQI in this sample.  
- Physiological arousal and reduced circadian amplitude: Resting heart rate and MESOR are elevated relative to the cohort (RHR 66.4 bpm, Z = 0.98; MESOR Z = 0.96), and cosinor amplitude is somewhat reduced (Z = –0.42). Elevated baseline cardiac activity together with flattened amplitude suggest higher physiological arousal and a less robust day–night physiological signal, both of which are often associated with poorer sleep quality.  
- Psychological well-being and satisfaction: Low self-reported happiness (current = 2; Z = –1.61) and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ –0.95), together with low interpersonal trust, are consistent with psychosocial stressors that typically co-occur with poorer subjective sleep.

Features that point toward relatively preserved or better sleep characteristics (factors that could reduce PSQI):
- Consolidated within-day activity/HR signal: Intradaily variability (IV = 0.30; Z = –1.73) is relatively low, which typically indicates lower fragmentation of activity/physiological state within days. Lower IV can reflect more consolidated rest/activity periods and may mitigate some sleep disturbance metrics.  
- Nocturnal cardiac dipping: Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal decline (progressive negative deviations from mesor across early-morning hours), indicating an intact nocturnal cardiovascular trough. This pattern is generally compatible with physiological sleep-related reductions in arousal.  
- Sleep quantity near sample average: Median sleep duration (6 h 37 m; Z = –0.71) is somewhat below the textbook recommendation but only modestly lower than the cohort mean; this by itself is not extreme and may not fully account for poor subjective sleep.  
- Low daytime napping: Mean daily naps are minimal (0.08; Z ≈ 0.12), which reduces one common contributor to nocturnal sleep fragmentation and makes compact nocturnal sleep more likely when sleep timing is regular.

Integrated interpretation and caveats:
Taken together, the strongest and most weighty indicators in this dataset are the high levels of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety and the extreme irregularity and lateness of sleep timing—each of which is known to have sizable effects on subjective sleep quality and each of which correlates positively with PSQI in the study sample. Physiological data show some supportive aspects (nocturnal heart-rate decline and low intraday fragmentation), but these appear insufficient to offset the behavioral and affective risk factors. Consequently, the overall pattern is most consistent with a PSQI score above the population mean (i.e., poorer sleep quality than typical participants). This conclusion is probabilistic and based on associations and aggregated metrics; it does not substitute for a direct PSQI value or clinical assessment. Notably, interventions that target regularizing sleep timing, reducing evening screen time, increasing daytime activity/exercise, and addressing depressive/anxious symptoms would be the most plausible strategies to expect improvements in PSQI-related sleep outcomes based on the presented data."
24883,"Summary and overall inference:
Across the multimodal record, the profile is mixed but leans toward indicators associated with worse global sleep quality. The participant’s median sleep onset is very late (03:00), and wearable-derived markers show elevated heart rate during late-night hours (notably 12–2 AM and 1–3 AM; hourly deviations Z ≈ 1.95–2.82), features that are positively correlated with higher PSQI in this sample (hourly HR–PSQI correlations up to ≈0.23). In balance with more neutral or protective features (median nightly sleep ≈6 h 53 min, low nap frequency, low depressive symptom score), the pattern suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the study population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73), i.e., worse than average, probably at a modest-to-moderate elevation relative to the sample.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI):
- Very late sleep timing: Median sleep start time at 03:00 is an extreme delay relative to typical schedules and is likely to increase subjective complaints captured by the PSQI (impairing daytime functioning, increasing perceived latency and disturbances). Sleep start variability (SD ≈69 min) further indicates inconsistent timing.  
- Nighttime physiological arousal: Aggregate hourly heart‑rate deviations show markedly elevated mean HR around midnight–2 AM (12–1 AM deviation = 11.9 bpm, Z = 1.95; 1–2 AM = 8.9 bpm, Z = 2.36; 2–3 AM = 7.4 bpm, Z = 2.82). These nocturnal HR elevations have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI (≈0.15–0.23), supporting their relevance to worse sleep quality.  
- Attenuated circadian amplitude and reduced rhythmic robustness: Cosinor amplitude is low (7.35, Z = -1.11) and interdaily stability is below the sample mean (0.29, Z = -0.99). Lower amplitude and stability reflect a blunted and less regular circadian signal, which is often associated with poorer sleep consolidation and timed sleep complaints.  
- Psychosocial contributors: Trait anxiety (STAI = 42) is slightly elevated (Z ≈ 0.07) and perceived stress is above the sample mean (PSS = 23, Z ≈ 0.38); both measures correlate positively with PSQI in this sample and could exacerbate sleep disturbance, especially when combined with late timing and nocturnal arousal. Moderate weekly alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week) also appears in the profile (Z ≈ 1.0), which can fragment sleep and interact with other risk features.

Evidence pointing toward relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI):
- Adequate total sleep time: Median nightly sleep duration is near seven hours (6 h 53 min; Z ≈ -0.38) and therefore not strongly indicative of severe sleep restriction. Sleep duration has only a small positive correlation with PSQI in this sample, suggesting duration alone is not the dominant driver of PSQI differences here.  
- Low nap burden and low night-to-night fragmentation signal: Mean daily naps are minimal (0.07/day), and intradaily variability (a wearable-derived index of fragmentation) is low (0.36, Z = -1.31), features that are consistent with relatively consolidated nocturnal sleep and less daytime compensatory behavior.  
- Favorable physiological baseline and mood buffers: Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.2 bpm, Z = -0.71), which can reflect cardiovascular fitness or low baseline arousal and may support sleep quality. Depressive symptoms are low (CES‑D = 9, Z = -0.45) and trait self‑esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 1.52); lower depressive symptom burden and higher self‑esteem are associated here with lower PSQI and could mitigate the impact of other risk factors.  
- Low use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs and limited evening stimulating behaviors (low videogame/time-use): these behaviors reduce some common behavioral contributors to poor sleep.

Integrated interpretation and degree of confidence:
Taken together, the strongest and most salient signals are (a) very late and irregular sleep timing, and (b) elevated late-night physiological arousal (elevated HR around midnight–3 AM) — both of which are directionally associated with higher PSQI in this sample and are likely the primary drivers increasing this participant’s sleep disturbance score. Protective features (close-to-recommended nightly duration, minimal naps, low depressive symptoms, low fragmentation) reduce the likelihood of extreme impairment but do not fully offset the timing/arousal pattern. Therefore the best-supported conclusion is that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI (worse than average), probably by a modest-to-moderate amount. This inference emphasizes physiological and timing-based markers (hourly HR deviations, delayed sleep onset, reduced circadian amplitude/stability) as the most influential contributors in the multimodal profile; uncertainty remains because objective duration and mood measures are relatively favorable, and the available correlations with PSQI are generally small to moderate."
66815,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration of about 7 hours 6 minutes (Z = -0.11), with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 40 minutes, Z = -1.38) and low reported napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). These features indicate consistent sleep opportunity and relatively stable total sleep time across the recording period. Circadian features derived from heart rate show a pronounced day–night contrast (amplitude Z = 1.64) and moderately high interdaily stability (0.51, Z = 0.83), together suggesting a coherent and regularly-timed circadian rhythm in physiological arousal across days. Resting heart rate and mesor are well below the study mean (resting HR = 45.8 bpm, Z = -1.47; mesor Z = -1.32), which typically indexes good cardiovascular fitness and lower nocturnal physiological arousal.

Self-report and behavioral context: On survey measures the participant reports low-to-moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and trait anxiety near the sample mean (STAI = 41, Z = -0.03). Positive psychosocial indicators—relatively high self-esteem (Z = 0.54), high self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64), and high interpersonal trust (Z = 1.47)—are present. Substance use is absent, and social/entertainment screen time is low; exercise with others is frequent (three times per week or more, Z = 1.23). These behavioral and affective features, together with low substance use, align with factors that are generally associated with better sleep quality in the study sample.

Evidence pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The clearest potential risk factor in the data is the late median sleep start time (approximately 01:49). Late habitual bedtimes can contribute to misalignment between biological timing and daytime obligations and are commonly associated with aspects of poorer subjective sleep quality even when total sleep time is adequate. Intradaily variability (0.60, Z = 0.39) is modestly elevated relative to the sample and could reflect some fragmentation or irregularity within days; while correlations with PSQI are small, intraday variability can relate to sleep disruption in some individuals. Trait anxiety has a positive correlation with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.40) and the participant’s STAI score is near the mean, so anxiety remains a potential contributor to subjective sleep complaints for this person.

Evidence pointing toward relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Multiple objective and behavioral indicators suggest favorable sleep quality. Median sleep duration is within a recommended range and is consistent night-to-night (low SD). High circadian amplitude and above-average interdaily stability indicate strong, regular daily structure of physiological arousal—patterns that in this sample relate to lower PSQI scores. Very low resting heart rate and low mesor are also consistent with lower baseline physiological arousal and, in this dataset, trend with better sleep. Psychosocially, low depressive symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, absence of alcohol or drug use, and regular exercise (especially with others) are all features associated with lower PSQI in the cohort.

Holistic comparison to population mean PSQI and uncertainty: Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of objective circadian stability, adequate and consistent sleep duration, low resting heart rate, and positive psychosocial indicators point toward sleep quality that is somewhat better than the study average. Given the available signals and their magnitudes (notably strong circadian amplitude and low resting HR vs. a single clear risk in very late sleep timing), the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being below the population mean PSQI (i.e., better than average), though close to the group mean rather than markedly different. The study sample mean PSQI is 6.73 (SD = 2.16); the pattern here suggests a likely PSQI lower than that mean but within roughly one-half to one standard deviation of it. Key caveats are that bed timing is late (which may produce subjective dissatisfaction or social jetlag not fully captured by duration), heart-rate metrics are temporally aggregated rather than day-specific, and several correlations with PSQI in the dataset are modest—so uncertainty remains about subjective sleep components not fully indexed by wearables.

In sum: objective physiology and many psychosocial behaviors support relatively good sleep quality for this participant compared with the study sample, but late habitual sleep onset and modest intraday variability leave open the possibility of some subjective sleep complaints; overall inferred sleep quality is slightly better than the sample mean (below the population mean PSQI) but near the population average."
89161,"The wearable sleep statistics and self-reports provide several indicators that would tend to predict relatively good sleep quantity and stability. The participant’s median nocturnal sleep duration was 7 hours 26 minutes (Z = 0.32), which is slightly above the study mean and within commonly recommended ranges. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 60 minutes, Z = -0.94) and in sleep start time (SD = 47 minutes, Z = -0.79) are both lower than the sample average, indicating relatively consistent sleep timing and length across the recording period. The participant reported essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), which supports consolidated nocturnal sleep. Psychological self-report measures that often co-vary with better sleep quality (low depressive symptoms: CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97; low trait anxiety: STAI = 31, Z = -1.02; relatively high happiness and health satisfaction: Happy Z = 1.64, Health Satisfaction Z = 1.38; high self-esteem Z = 1.52) further point toward a psychosocial profile that is unlikely to drive severely poor subjective sleep in this participant.

Conversely, several behavioral and physiological features point toward factors that could elevate PSQI scores (worse sleep quality). The participant habitually goes to sleep late (median sleep start time ~01:56), which may reduce alignment with daytime social/academic schedules and is commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep or daytime dysfunction. Evening physiological arousal is evident in aggregate heart-rate deviations: notable positive deviations from the mesor occur in late evening periods (10–11 pm: +16.9 bpm, Z = 1.65; 11–12 am: +12.1 bpm, Z = 1.29; midnight hour smaller positive deviation), suggesting elevated cardiovascular activation in the hours before typical sleep onset. Behavioral markers likely related to late evening stimulation are also elevated (internet use 3–4 hours, listening to music >4 hours, and socializing >4 hours; Z-scores between ~1.5 and 2.5), any of which can prolong evening wakefulness or interfere with sleep initiation. A particularly salient behavioral risk is frequent recreational drug use reported as “1–2 times a week” with a very high relative value in the sample (Z = 5.44); even though correlations with PSQI in the provided dataset are modest, this pattern stands out as a potential contributor to sleep disturbance. Finally, intradaily variability (a non-parametric indicator of fragmentation of activity/rest patterns) is elevated (value = 0.73, Z = 1.30), which is often associated with less structured daily rhythms and can relate to lower sleep consolidation or daytime sleepiness.

Physiological circadian metrics provide a mixed picture of sleep-linked physiology. The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are both below the sample mean (resting HR = 53.85 bpm, Z = -0.51; mesor = 67.64 bpm, Z = -0.86), which is generally consistent with lower baseline physiological arousal and can be protective for sleep quality. Nighttime hourly heart-rate deviations show substantial nocturnal reductions from the mesor during core sleep hours (e.g., 2–7 am deviations range roughly -14 to -20 bpm), indicating preserved nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation. At the same time, the reduced amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.33) and the acrophase occurring in the late afternoon (5:38 pm) indicate a circadian profile that is not strongly amplified, and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.30) suggests day-to-day behavioral irregularity. Together these physiological features suggest that although the participant achieves typical nocturnal cardiovascular rest once asleep, there is evidence of evening hyperarousal and daytime fragmentation that could interfere with sleep onset or subjective sleep quality.

Weighing the full set of evidence produces a balanced inference about overall sleep quality relative to the study sample. Positive features—adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, absence of naps, low depressive and anxiety symptoms, and low resting heart rate—favor a relatively lower PSQI (better sleep). Countervailing factors—consistent late bedtimes (~2:00 AM), elevated evening heart-rate deviations suggestive of pre-sleep arousal, high intradaily variability, and notably frequent recreational drug use—are plausibly associated with higher PSQI (poorer sleep). Considering the magnitude and number of both kinds of indicators, the aggregate profile is most consistent with sleep quality that is close to the sample average rather than distinctly better or worse. In summary: the participant’s inferred overall sleep quality is near the population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73), with some protective features that could push toward a lower PSQI and several behavioral/physiological risk factors that could push toward a higher PSQI—resulting in an overall assessment of sleep quality near the study sample mean."
14847,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian physiology: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration of 6 hours 38 minutes (Z = -0.69) with a relatively large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 134 minutes, Z = 0.75) and a late median sleep onset time of ~02:24 with substantial variability in sleep onset (SD = 104 minutes, Z = 0.46). Circadian-summary features indicate relatively low regularity and rhythm robustness: interdaily stability is below the sample mean (Value = 0.35, Z = -0.49), amplitude is modestly reduced (Z = -0.41), and intradaily variability is elevated (Value = 0.83, Z = 2.01), consistent with fragmented or irregular daily cardiovascular activity. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal heart-rate nadir but also elevated evening and late-evening deviations (e.g., 7–11 pm positive deviations), supporting a pattern of delayed and somewhat compressed rest-activity timing rather than an early or rigid sleep schedule. Together, these objective signals point toward shorter, later, and more variable sleep with reduced circadian rhythm stability.

Features that converge on higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): Several behavioral and psychological indicators that are positively associated with higher PSQI in this sample are present here. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 24, Z = 1.11) and higher trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86); both measures show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), implying these symptoms are likely to coincide with worse subjective sleep. Objective markers that typically relate to poorer sleep—high intradaily variability (Z = 2.01), substantial night-to-night sleep duration variability, late average sleep onset (~02:24), and increased mean daily naps (0.24 naps/day, Z = 1.9)—also point toward fragmented sleep/wake organization and circadian misalignment, patterns that are associated with higher PSQI scores. The participant’s lower self-esteem (RSES Z = -0.45) and moderately elevated perceived stress (PSS Z = 0.65) further align with risk for worse subjective sleep (self-esteem and stress correlations with PSQI in this sample are in expected directions).

Features that converge on lower PSQI (better sleep quality): There are several mitigating factors that provide some counterbalance. The participant reports regular exercise at least three times per week (exercise Z = 1.07), a behavior weakly associated with better sleep in this dataset (correlation ≈ -0.09). Alcohol and non-prescribed drug use are low, which reduces one common behavioral risk for poor sleep. Resting heart rate and overall MESOR are near the sample mean (RHR ≈ 58.4 bpm, MESOR Z ≈ 0.10), and the nocturnal heart-rate decline is present, which are physiologic signs compatible with preserved nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence. Self-reported health satisfaction is moderately above average (Z ≈ 0.97) and current happiness is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.55), both of which are associated with somewhat better sleep outcomes in the study. These protective elements reduce, but do not fully offset, the weight of indicators that favor poorer sleep.

Holistic assessment relative to the study population: Weighing the evidence overall, the preponderance of salient indicators—elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (moderately correlated with PSQI), late and variable sleep timing, high intradaily variability, increased nap frequency, and substantial night-to-night variability in sleep duration—suggest the participant’s sleep quality is likely worse than the average participant in this sample. Therefore, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI level above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.71, SD = 2.16). This conclusion emphasizes relative likelihood (greater-than-average PSQI score) rather than a precise individual PSQI value.

Caveats and interpretation boundaries: These inferences combine cross-sectional associations, self-report scales, and wearable-aggregated physiology; they do not establish causal relationships and are sensitive to measurement limitations (e.g., aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations are not day-specific and PSQI was not directly reported here). The objectively measured nocturnal heart-rate decline and participation in regular exercise are meaningful protective signs, but the marked irregularity in sleep timing and elevated internalizing symptoms are strong drivers toward higher subjective sleep disturbance in this dataset."
75438,"Summary of wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
The wearable record indicates a consistent nocturnal reduction in heart rate and a clear daytime peak (acrophase ~3:28 PM), with a modest amplitude (10.5; Z ≈ -0.08) and a mesor below the study mean (69.5 bpm; Z ≈ -0.61). Resting heart rate is low (53 bpm; Z ≈ -0.61), consistent with good cardiorespiratory fitness and usual overnight autonomic recovery (hourly heart-rate deviations reach their nadir between ~3–5 AM, ~20 bpm below mesor). Non-parametric circadian features show relatively low interdaily stability (0.33; Z ≈ -0.66), indicating day-to-day variability in the timing or strength of the rhythm, while intradaily variability is also relatively low (0.39; Z ≈ -1.09), which indicates relatively little within-day fragmentation of the heart-rate signal. Together these patterns suggest intact day–night physiology on average but some inconsistency in day-to-day timing of that physiology.

Evidence favoring relatively good sleep quality (predictors of lower PSQI):
Several behavioral and psychosocial indicators are protective. Subjective measures of mood and stress are relatively favorable: CES-D (7; Z ≈ -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 36; Z ≈ -0.52) are below the study mean, and perceived stress is relatively low (PSS = 18; Z ≈ -0.98); these lower affective burdens are associated in this dataset with better PSQI scores (moderate positive correlations of PSQI with depression and anxiety mean that lower symptom scores tend to align with lower PSQI). High exercise frequency (exercising alone three+ times/week; Z ≈ 1.07) and a low resting heart rate are additional factors that typically support better sleep continuity and efficiency. Low intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythm (Z ≈ -1.09) implies relatively consolidated daily physiology, which is generally aligned with fewer within-night disruptions. The participant reports essentially no naps and high self-rated health satisfaction (Z ≈ 0.63), both of which commonly accompany better subjective sleep.

Evidence favoring relatively poor sleep quality (predictors of higher PSQI):
Objective sleep timing and duration patterns are the primary signals pointing toward poorer sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 2 minutes (Z ≈ -1.43), substantially below typical recommendations and below most peers in this sample, which tends to increase PSQI component scores related to sleep duration and daytime dysfunction. Median sleep start time is late (about 1:43 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 66 minutes), and interdaily stability of the circadian heart-rate rhythm is reduced (Z ≈ -0.66); together these features indicate a relatively late and somewhat irregular sleep schedule, which is associated with higher PSQI in many study participants. Weekly alcohol use (wine or liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 0.94) is another modest risk factor for sleep fragmentation or perceived poor sleep quality. Although intradaily variability is low, the combination of short sleep duration, late and inconsistent bedtimes, and reduced day-to-day stability of circadian timing remains a coherent set of risk factors for elevated PSQI.

Integrated appraisal and comparison to the study population:
Balancing the lines of evidence, the strongest indicators of poorer sleep quality are the objectively short median sleep duration (≈6 h), late median bedtime (~1:45 AM), and reduced interdaily stability; these are counterbalanced by favorable psychological status (low depression/anxiety/stress), frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, and low intradaily fragmentation. Taking the relative magnitudes into account, the net pattern suggests overall sleep quality that is close to the study sample average but with a modest tilt toward poorer sleep—i.e., near the population mean PSQI with indications that it may be slightly above (worse than) the mean. Concretely, compared to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile places them near the mean, with late timing and short sleep duration creating the primary risk for a PSQI at or slightly higher than the sample average.

Key uncertainties and caveats:
This conclusion integrates aggregated wearable circadian metrics, nightly summary statistics, and cross-sectional self-report measures; the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations cannot resolve night-to-night variability in sleep quality or nighttime awakenings, and correlations provided in the dataset are small for many circadian variables. Because subjective sleep quality (PSQI) depends both on objective sleep and on daytime functioning and attitudes, the participant’s favorable affective profile could partially mitigate the impact of short sleep on perceived sleep quality."
99733,"Summary — overall pattern
The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixed sleep-quality picture: objective wearable data show somewhat shortened and moderately variable nocturnal sleep (median sleep 6 h 43 min; sleep-duration SD 86 minutes) with a median sleep onset shortly after midnight (00:38). Circadian/heart‑rate features indicate a detectable day–night structure (mesor 74.9 bpm; daytime acrophase ~3:08 PM) but relative irregularity in activity/rhythm measures (intradaily variability = 0.70, Z = 1.09). Self-report psychological measures are generally favorable (low depressive symptoms CES‑D = 5, Z = −0.86; low trait anxiety STAI = 31, Z = −1.02; relatively high health satisfaction). Taking all evidence into account, the total pattern is most consistent with sleep quality near the study population average (i.e., near the mean PSQI of 6.73), with both protective and risk-related features present.

Features that would tend to increase PSQI (worse sleep)
Several objective indicators point toward elements commonly associated with higher PSQI scores. Sleep duration is below 7 hours on average (median 6 h 43 min; Z = −0.58), and night‑to‑night variability in duration is moderate (SD 86 min), both of which are linked in the literature to poorer subjective sleep. Sleep onset is somewhat late (median ~00:38) with a sleep‑start SD of ~65 minutes, indicating variability in timing that can degrade sleep continuity. The wearable circadian metrics show elevated intradaily variability (0.70; Z = +1.09), which reflects greater fragmentation of activity/rest patterns across the day and is often associated with worse sleep continuity and subjective sleep problems. Resting heart rate is modestly higher than the sample mean (62.6 bpm; Z = +0.53), and some early‑morning heart‑rate deviations have positive Z‑scores, which can reflect altered autonomic recovery overnight; both patterns have small positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset.

Features that would tend to decrease PSQI (better sleep)
Several behavioral and psychological features are protective and predict lower PSQI scores. The participant reports low depressive symptoms and low trait anxiety (CES‑D and STAI both well below sample means), which in this sample are fairly strongly correlated with PSQI (CES‑D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), so the participant’s low symptom burden is likely to be sleep‑protective. Substance use is essentially absent (no alcohol or recreational/non‑prescribed drug use), naps are infrequent (mean daily naps 0.09), and reported screen and recreational times are low; these lifestyle patterns typically support better sleep. Interdaily stability (0.39; Z ≈ −0.16) and the presence of a daytime heart‑rate peak around midday (large positive deviations 11–13:00) indicate preserved day–night contrast in physiology for much of the day, which is generally favorable for nocturnal sleep timing and consolidation.

Circadian and physiological interpretation
The cosinor-derived mesor and acrophase indicate a coherent daytime elevation of heart rate with a peak in mid‑afternoon, consistent with a normally-phased active period. However, the relatively low amplitude (9.44; Z = −0.43) plus the elevated intradaily variability and reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.26; Z = −0.53) suggest the day–night rhythm is somewhat blunted and that day‑to‑day regularity is lower than average. This combination — preserved daytime peaks but greater within‑day fragmentation and reduced regularity across days — can produce subjective perceptions of disturbed or nonrestorative sleep despite intact daytime activity, and explains the mixed signal in the wearable data.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean
Balancing the risk and protective indicators, the participant’s profile is consistent with overall sleep quality near the study sample mean PSQI (6.73). Objective markers (shorter-than-recommended sleep duration, moderate variability in both timing and amount, elevated intradaily variability) create vulnerability for a higher PSQI, while favorable psychological status (low depression/anxiety/stress), minimal substance use, and preserved daytime physiological activation are protective and tend toward a lower PSQI. In other words, the participant shows some objective features that may raise PSQI but also multiple behavioral and psychological supports that mitigate those risks; the net impression is sleep quality near the population mean rather than clearly above (worse) or below (better) it."
27407,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mix of behavioral, psychological, and physiological features that together point toward a sleep pattern characterized by late sleep timing and somewhat short nightly sleep, coupled with physiological signs of evening arousal but preserved nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation. Key quantitative anchors are a median sleep duration of 6 hours 14 minutes (Z = -1.17), a very late median sleep start time of ~02:02 AM, trait anxiety (STAI trait = 50, Z = 0.86), resting heart rate of 46.3 bpm (Z = -1.41), and circadian cosinor parameters with a modestly elevated amplitude (Z = 0.47) and low MESOR (Z = -1.20). These elements, considered together with the provided correlations to PSQI for related measures, indicate more evidence for elevated sleep complaints than for robust sleep health.

Features consistent with higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): The late habitual sleep onset (~02:00) and relatively short median sleep duration (6:14) are the most direct behavioral indicators that tend to accompany worse subjective sleep quality. Sleep duration shows some night-to-night variability (SD = 120 minutes, Z = 0.43), a pattern that correlates positively with PSQI in the sample and can contribute to daytime impairment. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.86) and above-average perceived stress (PSS Z = 0.38) are psychological risk factors that, per the sample correlations, are associated with higher PSQI scores. Wearable-derived hourly heart rate deviations show pronounced positive departures from mesor in the evening hours (notably 7–10 pm and a positive deviation at 12–1 am) which can reflect evening physiological arousal or activity that may delay sleep onset and fragment perceived sleep. Taken together, these behavioral, psychological, and physiological cues point toward mechanisms that commonly raise PSQI scores (late timing, shorter sleep, evening arousal, anxiety/stress).

Features consistent with lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Several physiologic and lifestyle signals suggest protective elements. The participant’s resting heart rate is low (46.3 bpm, Z = -1.41) and the aggregated hourly heart rate profile shows deep nocturnal dips (large negative deviations from mesor between ~2–7 am), which are consistent with consolidated physiological sleep and a relatively robust nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation—features typically associated with better objective sleep physiology. Circadian rhythm metrics show a positive amplitude (Z = 0.47) and a reasonable 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 0.39), indicating preserved day–night structure in heart-rate signals. Substance use is minimal (rare alcohol, no recreational or non-prescribed drug use) and exercise occurs regularly (exercise 1–2 times/week; Z values modestly positive), both of which tend to support sleep. Subjective mood/happiness is above average (happiness Z = 0.55), which in the sample is inversely correlated with PSQI and can buffer sleep problems. Finally, sleep start time variability is relatively low (SD ~51 minutes, Z = -0.71), suggesting a consistent late timing rather than highly irregular sleep, which moderates some risks associated with variable schedules.

Holistic assessment relative to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the profile leans toward a higher-than-average PSQI (i.e., worse sleep quality) primarily driven by late timing, short nightly sleep, elevated trait anxiety, and signs of evening physiological arousal. Countervailing evidence—strong nocturnal HR dips, low resting HR, minimal substance use, modest exercise, and consistent sleep timing—mitigates but does not outweigh the risks. On balance, the participant’s sleep quality is most consistent with being above the study sample’s mean PSQI score of 6.71 (that is, worse than the sample average), rather than near or below the mean.

Notes and caveats: This interpretation integrates wearable-derived physiology, self-report traits, and behavioral measures but is not a clinical diagnosis. The participant’s relatively low depressive symptom score (CES-D near the sample mean) and some protective lifestyle features attenuate the estimated risk. Because the PSQI itself was not provided, the conclusion is an inference based on established correlates in the dataset and should be confirmed with the participant’s actual PSQI score and, if needed, with targeted assessment of sleep latency, fragmentation, and daytime functioning."
43794,"Summary: The available multimodal data indicate a mixed sleep profile with several signals pointing toward disrupted or lower-quality sleep alongside some compensating features. Psychometrically, the participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = 1.35) and above-typical perceived stress (PSS = 26, Z = 1.19). Physiologically and behaviorally, there is evidence of circadian irregularity (interdaily stability = 0.20, Z = -1.73) and dampened circadian amplitude (amplitude = 5.34, Z = -1.76), together with a relatively high resting heart rate (70.8 bpm, Z = 1.50). Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:03) and night-to-night variability in both duration and start time is elevated (sleep duration SD = 156 min, Z = 1.25; sleep start SD = 122 min, Z = 0.86). Taken together, these features suggest a pattern of circadian misalignment and physiological arousal that are often associated with worse subjective sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality): Elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and higher perceived stress are notable risk factors for poor sleep in this dataset (STAI Z = 1.35; STAI–PSQI correlation ~0.40; PSS Z = 1.19). The participant’s low interdaily stability (Z = -1.73) and reduced circadian amplitude (Z = -1.76) reflect weak, irregular daily structure in heart-rate rhythms—a pattern linked to worse sleep consolidation and subjective sleep complaints. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and relatively late average sleep onset further increase the likelihood of fragmented sleep or difficulties initiating sleep (sleep-duration SD Z = 1.25; median start ~01:03). A relatively high resting heart rate (Z = 1.50) may indicate elevated baseline physiological arousal. Several of these metrics have positive correlations with PSQI in the study (e.g., anxiety r ≈ 0.40; duration variability r ≈ 0.20), reinforcing their relevance to higher PSQI scores.

Evidence consistent with lower PSQI (better sleep quality): The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is close to seven hours (6 h 59 m, Z = -0.24), which falls near recommended ranges and argues against severe chronic short sleep. The participant reports no daily naps (Z = -0.86), reducing potential circadian fragmentation from daytime sleep. Overnight heart-rate deviations show marked nocturnal declines relative to the daytime mesor (strong negative deviations across the 2–7 AM window, many with positive Z-scores), which can reflect preserved nocturnal parasympathetic dominance and restorative physiology despite an elevated resting heart rate. Intradaily variability of heart rate is near the study mean (Z ≈ 0.03), indicating that, within days, fragmentation of activity/rest cycles is not markedly extreme. Low use of recreational drugs and only modest alcohol consumption further reduce common behavioral contributors to poor sleep.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the pattern of elevated anxiety and stress, late and irregular sleep timing, low interdaily stability and low circadian amplitude, and elevated resting heart rate argue that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely worse than average in the sample. Although total sleep time is near normative and nocturnal heart-rate declines appear preserved, the constellation of psychological arousal and circadian irregularity—measures that show non-trivial correlations with PSQI—supports an inference of a PSQI score above the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). In summary, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is most consistent with being above the population mean (i.e., relatively poorer sleep), likely at a moderate level rather than an extreme outlier, given some compensatory physiological and behavioral signs."
51437,"Summary of physiological and sleep-timing evidence suggesting poorer-than-average sleep: Wearable-derived sleep timing and circadian metrics show several characteristics associated with elevated PSQI scores. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 15 minutes (Z = -1.16), indicating a shorter sleep quantity relative to the study sample. Sleep onset is very late (median start ~02:14 AM) but relatively consistent (start-time SD 32 minutes, Z = -1.12), which is commonly linked with poorer subjective sleep quality even if timing is stable. Circadian measures show elevated intradaily variability (0.76, Z = 1.51) and reduced amplitude (5.87, Z = -1.59), consistent with a more fragmented, lower-amplitude circadian rhythm — both features that tend to co-occur with worse sleep quality. Resting heart rate is elevated (73 bpm, Z = 1.77) and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile includes unusually high deviations around late evening and midnight (12–1 AM deviation = 25.6, Z = 3.91; 11–12 PM deviation = 13.67, Z = 1.52), suggesting periods of elevated physiological arousal during typical sleep hours. Together, these wearable signals point toward conditions that usually accompany higher PSQI scores (poorer sleep).

Summary of psychosocial and behavioral evidence suggesting better-than-average sleep: Self-report measures and lifestyle behaviors provide multiple protective signals that would tend to reduce PSQI scores. Current depressive and trait anxiety symptoms are low (CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97; STAI = 35, Z = -0.62). Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.96), perceived stress is not elevated (PSS Z = -0.44), and health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.3). The participant reports regular, frequent exercise and sports participation (exercised alone three times a week or more; sports three times a week or more; exercise Z-scores +1.07 and +1.58), which are factors commonly associated with better sleep. Substance use and napping are minimal. These psychosocial and behavioral assets would be expected to buffer sleep problems and reduce the likelihood of very high PSQI scores.

Balanced integration and interpretation: The pattern is mixed but leans toward suboptimal sleep. On the one hand, objective/wearable indicators—short sleep duration, late sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability, low circadian amplitude, elevated resting heart rate, and marked late-evening/midnight heart-rate elevations—are robust markers that commonly correspond with higher PSQI scores and more disturbed nocturnal physiology. On the other hand, low mood and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, frequent physical activity, low substance use, and reasonable health satisfaction are protective and argue against severe chronic sleep disturbance driven by mood or substance factors. Correlations provided in the dataset between individual metrics and PSQI are generally modest, so no single measure fully determines the likely PSQI; instead the convergence of multiple circadian and nocturnal arousal markers increases the plausibility of worse sleep despite favorable psychosocial context.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Considering the balance of evidence, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being above the population mean PSQI (i.e., poorer sleep than average). The study sample mean PSQI is 6.73 (SD = 2.16); the combination of short median sleep, late and concentrated sleep timing, increased intradaily variability, reduced circadian amplitude, and elevated nocturnal/late-evening heart-rate deviations supports an inference of PSQI modestly higher than the sample mean rather than substantially worse or near the best sleepers. Limitations: this inference combines cross-sectional wearable aggregates and single-time self-report inventories; aggregated hourly heart-rate values do not show day-to-day variation, and correlations with PSQI in the dataset are generally small—so conclusions should be treated as probabilistic rather than definitive."
21932,"Summary of features supporting relatively good sleep quality:
The wearable-recorded sleep metrics indicate several robust markers associated with comparatively good sleep. Median nightly sleep duration was 8 hours 14 minutes (Z = +1.31), with a relatively small night-to-night standard deviation (50 minutes; Z = −1.15), indicating both above-average total sleep time and stable sleep duration across the recording period. Mean daily naps were negligible (0.08 naps/day), and median sleep start time was reasonably regular (00:37, sleep start SD = 55 minutes; Z = −0.61). Physiologically, resting heart rate was low (54.1 bpm; Z = −0.48), consistent with higher cardiovascular fitness and generally lower sympathetic tone—factors that typically accompany better sleep consolidation. On the self-report side the participant endorses low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4, Z = −0.97) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = −1.31), very low perceived stress (PSS Z = −2.34), high self-esteem (RSES Z = +1.66), low substance and recreational drug use, and good health satisfaction (Z = +0.55). These psychological and lifestyle features conventionally correlate with lower PSQI scores and support an inference of relatively good subjective and objective sleep.

Summary of features that could indicate poorer sleep quality:
There are also indicators that point toward possible sleep continuity or circadian fragmentation issues. Intradaily variability of heart rate (a nonparametric measure reflecting frequent transitions between rest and activity) is elevated (Value = 0.68; Z = +0.95), which has been linked in the literature to more fragmented rest/activity patterns and, in some samples, worse sleep quality. Several hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively large positive departures from the mesor in late evening and around midnight (notably 10–11 pm: +26.4 bpm, Z = +3.14; 12–1 am: +8.5 bpm, Z = +1.47), which can reflect elevated physiological arousal in the pre-sleep period. Elevated evening arousal may interfere with sleep initiation or the subjective ease of falling asleep for some people even if total sleep time remains adequate. The cosinor amplitude is modestly above average (amplitude = 12.13; Z = +0.44) but the participant’s acrophase (~5:20 PM) and the pattern of pronounced midday and late-evening deviations suggest an activity/physiological profile that is not purely morning-anchored; this mixture can be associated with timing mismatches for some individuals and may contribute to sleep fragmentation in certain contexts.

Circadian rhythm and heart-rate pattern interpretation:
Circadian regularity measures provide a mixed picture. Interdaily stability (0.49; Z = +0.67) suggests a reasonably consistent 24‑hour pattern of behavior/physiology across days, and the autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.34; Z = +0.14) is near the sample mean—both consistent with day-to-day regularity. At the same time, the elevated intradaily variability implies that within-day transitions between higher and lower physiological arousal are relatively frequent. The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough (large negative deviations from ~2–8 AM, down as low as −23.5 bpm) consistent with consolidated sleep physiology overnight, but the relatively large positive deviations clustered around late evening/midnight and a very large spike at 10–11 pm point to notable evening activity/arousal prior to the participant’s typical sleep onset (~00:37). Overall, the circadian summary suggests a mostly regular sleep-wake schedule with some within-day instability and notable pre-sleep physiological activation.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study sample:
Weighing the convergent evidence, the balance favors generally good sleep quality for this participant relative to the study sample. Objective markers—long and consistent sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, minimal naps, a deep nocturnal HR trough, and low resting heart rate—coupled with favorable psychosocial measures (low stress, low depressive/anxious symptoms, high self-esteem, low substance use) point toward a lower PSQI (better sleep). The main countervailing concerns are elevated intradaily variability and late-evening physiological arousal that could degrade subjective sleep continuity or sleep onset in some situations, but these are not accompanied by large night-to-night duration variability or high nap frequency. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a PSQI below the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). In other words, inferred overall sleep quality is likely better than the average participant in this sample, though some indices (evening arousal and intradaily variability) warrant attention when interpreting subjective difficulties with sleep onset or continuity."
36385,"Summary of objective sleep behavior and timing: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a relatively long typical sleep episode for this participant (median sleep duration = 8 h 47 min; Z = 2.0), but this is accompanied by substantial variability (sleep duration SD = 133 minutes, Z = 0.73) and a late, variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 00:54, sleep start SD = 140 minutes, Z = 1.26). Daytime napping is minimal (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08). Taken together, the participant sleeps for long bouts on average but with irregular timing and day-to-day duration, a pattern that increases the likelihood of subjective sleep complaints in many samples (sleep-duration variability and sleep-timing variability both show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset: r ≈ 0.20 and r ≈ 0.18, respectively).

Physiological circadian and cardiac profile: Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate a measurable day–night structure (MESOR ≈ 76.96 bpm, amplitude ≈ 10.8 bpm, acrophase ~5:23 PM). The aggregated hourly deviations show a robust nocturnal decline from the mesor (largest negative deviations ~ -14 to -17 bpm between ~3–7 AM) and a prominent evening peak (largest positive deviation ~ +16.9 bpm at 7–8 PM). Resting heart rate is modestly elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 64.1 bpm, Z = 0.7) and shows a small positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.12). Non-parametric rhythm metrics are near-sample-mean (interdaily stability = 0.44, intradaily variability = 0.56), indicating some day-to-day regularity but not strongly consolidated activity–rest timing. Overall, the presence of a clear nocturnal heart-rate dip supports preserved physiological sleep-related rest, but the prominent evening cardiovascular activation and only moderate daily stability may reflect late-day arousal and timing irregularity that can undermine sleep quality.

Psychological and behavioral context relevant to sleep: Self-report measures show elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29; Z = 1.63) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76). Both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating that higher mood and anxiety symptom burden are strongly associated with poorer reported sleep in this cohort. Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES Z ≈ -1.01), and lower self-esteem correlates negatively with sleep quality in the sample (r ≈ -0.36). Lifestyle factors that may bear on sleep include regular weekly alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2×/week; Z ≈ 0.94) and relatively high evening leisure/music time (listening to music 2–3 hours, Z ≈ 1.13); these behaviors have small positive correlations with PSQI in this sample. Exercise frequency is moderate, and naps are infrequent.

Evidence pointing toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several convergent signals indicate factors associated with worse PSQI. Psychological symptom burden is the most salient: high CES‑D and elevated STAI scores both strongly correlate with worse PSQI in the sample (especially CES‑D, r ≈ 0.50), and the participant’s elevated scores place them well above the study mean. Irregular sleep timing and duration (high SD for start time and duration) are associated with worse PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.18–0.20) and are prominent here. Evening physiological activation (evening HR peak) and a modestly elevated resting heart rate (RHR Z ≈ 0.7) are also aligned with small but positive PSQI correlations and may reflect arousal that interferes with sleep initiation or maintenance. Weekly alcohol use and some evening leisure may further contribute to subjective sleep disturbance in some individuals.

Evidence pointing toward better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Objective signs that could be protective include a long median sleep duration (≈8 h 47 min), which often reduces short-sleep–related complaints and is associated with only a small positive correlation with PSQI here (r ≈ 0.06). Minimal daytime napping limits sleep fragmentation across the 24-hour day. The nocturnal heart-rate dip is pronounced, suggesting preserved physiological downregulation during sleep. Circadian amplitude is near the sample mean and interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.25), which can support consolidated sleep in many cases.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to study population mean PSQI: Balancing the objective and subjective signals, the pattern is mixed: long average sleep time and a clear nocturnal physiological rest signal argue against severe objective sleep restriction, but substantial irregularity in sleep timing and duration, late sleep onset timing, elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and indicators of evening physiological arousal are convergent with factors that, in this cohort, are reliably associated with worse subjective sleep. Given the strong association between depressive symptoms and PSQI in this sample and the participant’s relatively high CES‑D and STAI scores, the overall profile is most consistent with a PSQI score above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73). This conclusion is qualified by the long median sleep duration and preserved nocturnal HR dip, which could reduce the magnitude of subjective complaints—so while the data point toward sleep quality that is worse than average in this cohort, the evidence is not uniformly indicative of severe objective sleep loss."
54030,"Summary of features consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality: Wearable-recorded sleep timing is markedly delayed, with a median sleep start near 02:56 AM, and a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 18 minutes (Z = -1.09), both of which are risk-relevant for sleep disturbance. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively high (SD = 143 minutes, Z = 0.96), and daytime napping is elevated (mean naps/day = 0.22, Z = 1.75); both greater variability and more frequent napping were associated with higher PSQI scores in the study sample. Circadian/actigraphy-derived rhythm metrics reflect irregularity and dampening of the daily rhythm: low interdaily stability (0.28, Z = -1.07), high intradaily variability (0.88, Z = 2.36), low amplitude (6.78, Z = -1.29) and low 24-hour autocorrelation (0.18, Z = -1.20). These features—irregular day-to-day timing, increased fragmentation within days, and lower rhythm amplitude—are typically linked to poorer subjective sleep quality. Physiologically, the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively elevated heart rate in the late evening (peak deviation at 10–11 PM = +14.19, Z = 1.22) and large overnight reductions consistent with sleep, suggesting heightened evening physiological arousal preceding the participant’s late sleep onset. Taken together, the timing, variability, napping, circadian irregularity, and evening arousal point toward processes that tend to increase PSQI scores.

Summary of features consistent with relatively better sleep quality: Several self-report trait and lifestyle measures in this participant are protective or associated with lower PSQI in the study sample. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07) and trait anxiety is low (STAI trait = 27, Z = -1.41), both of which had moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the cohort (i.e., higher depression/anxiety were associated with worse PSQI). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are comparatively high (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = 1.52; happiness Z = 1.64), and the participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use; these characteristics align with lower sleep complaints in the sample. Resting heart rate (58.4 bpm, Z = 0.03) is near average and overall health satisfaction is moderately above the mean (Z = 0.72), further supporting physiological and subjective resilience that can mitigate sleep problems.

Integration of circadian, behavioral and physiological evidence: The strongest signal in the wearable data is a misaligned and unstable daily rhythm rather than a high baseline physiological arousal. The circadian acrophase at ~5:40 PM with low amplitude suggests a flattened rhythm that peaks in the late afternoon/evening, while the high intradaily variability (Z = 2.36) indicates frequent transitions between activity and rest within days. The late median sleep start time (~03:00) combined with elevated evening heart rate (notably at 10–11 PM) implies that behavioral/physiological activation late in the evening may be delaying sleep onset. This pattern—late and irregular timing plus evening arousal and daytime napping—is coherent with poorer subjective sleep in this sample even when total sleep time alone is only moderately short. At the same time, low scores on depression and anxiety measures and low substance use suggest the participant’s sleep complaints are less likely to be driven by mood disorders or substance-related effects.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the participant displays a mixed profile: protective psychological traits but clear behavioral and circadian signatures that are typically associated with worse subjective sleep. On net, the data indicate that this participant’s sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI score (i.e., worse than average in this sample). The strongest contributors to that inferred elevation are very late sleep timing (~02:56 AM), high night-to-night variability (SD ~143 minutes), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 2.36), increased napping, and evening physiological activation. Protective factors—low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, and low substance use—may attenuate but do not fully counterbalance the influence of the circadian and behavioral irregularities."
34062,"Objective wearable and self-report data together indicate that the participant obtains a typical amount of nocturnal sleep and shows several behavioral and physiological markers that are generally consistent with relatively good sleep quality. Median nightly sleep duration recorded by the wearable was 7 hours 6 minutes (Z ≈ -0.11 versus the study sample), with a sleep-duration standard deviation of 80 minutes (Z ≈ -0.47), and a low rate of daily napping (mean 0.14 naps/day, Z ≈ 0.82 but low absolute frequency). Sleep start time median was about 23:24 with a standard deviation of ~95 minutes (Z ≈ 0.26), indicating occasional later nights but overall a consistent sleep opportunity close to normative timing. These sizing and variability metrics are consistent with sleep quantity and night-to-night stability that are not likely to substantially elevate PSQI scores.

Psychological and lifestyle survey data contain mixed influences but overall tilt toward protection. Depressive symptom level (CES-D = 7, Z ≈ -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 36, Z ≈ -0.52) are below the study mean; these variables are among the stronger correlates of PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.50, STAI r ≈ 0.40), so the participant’s low values on these risk factors likely reduce PSQI (i.e., predict better subjective sleep). High self‑esteem (RSES Z ≈ +1.38) and higher self-reported happiness (Z ≈ +1.64), together with frequent exercise (exercising alone/with others ≥ three times/week; Z ≈ +1.1 to +1.2) and high health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.8), further point toward behavioral and affective supports for good sleep. The clearest adverse psychological factor is perceived stress (PSS = 26, Z ≈ +1.19); given its small-to-moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.19), elevated stress could modestly worsen subjective sleep quality.

Physiological and circadian heartbeat-derived features show a generally low baseline cardiac response and a daytime-peaked rhythm, but with signs of reduced day-to-day regularity that may be relevant to sleep. Resting heart rate was unusually low (45.7 bpm, Z ≈ -1.48), which commonly reflects cardiovascular fitness and tends to associate with healthier sleep patterns. Cosinor-derived features indicate a modest amplitude (Z ≈ -0.40), a MESOR lower than the sample mean (Z ≈ -2.08), and an acrophase near mid-afternoon (≈15:08), producing a distinct daytime elevation and nighttime trough in hourly mean heart rate deviations. At the same time, interdaily stability is below average (0.36, Z ≈ -0.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.22, Z ≈ -0.87), which imply less consistent day-to-day timing of circadian physiology. Although these circadian irregularity metrics have relatively small correlations with PSQI in the sample (e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ -0.06, autocorrelation r ≈ -0.02), the pattern of lower regularity could contribute to subjective sleep fragmentation or difficulty with sleep timing for some individuals.

Balancing the evidence, the specific features most likely to increase PSQI (i.e., predict poorer sleep) are: elevated perceived stress (PSS Z ≈ +1.19), modest variability in sleep start times (SD ≈ 95 minutes, Z ≈ +0.26), and reduced interdaily rhythm stability / low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.41 and -0.87 respectively). Each of these factors has either a direct positive association with PSQI in the sample or theoretical links to poorer sleep consolidation. Conversely, the features that most strongly point to a lower PSQI (better sleep) are: normative-to-healthy sleep duration (≈7 h), lower depressive and anxiety symptomatology (CES‑D and STAI both below mean; CES‑D is a relatively strong predictor, r ≈ 0.50), high self-esteem and happiness (both associated in the sample with lower PSQI), frequent exercise, low resting heart rate (Z ≈ -1.48), and relatively low night-to-night variability in sleep length (SD Z ≈ -0.47). Many of these protective features carry the larger effect sizes or stronger sample correlations with PSQI (notably depressive symptoms and self-esteem), and the participant’s values on those measures are favorable.

Holistic conclusion: integrating wearable, circadian, and survey data, the participant’s overall sleep profile appears to be at least as good as, and likely somewhat better than, the study sample average. In population terms this pattern would be interpreted as an expected PSQI score below the study mean (population mean PSQI = 6.71, SD = 2.16). This judgment rests principally on adequate nightly sleep duration, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self‑reported well‑being and health satisfaction, regular exercise and low resting heart rate — all of which are associated with lower PSQI in the sample. Elevated perceived stress and modest circadian irregularity represent the main countervailing influences that could produce occasional subjective sleep complaints, so monitoring stress and promoting consistent sleep timing might be the most relevant targets should sleep quality concerns emerge."
18111,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of preserved objective sleep duration and signs of circadian irregularity and psychological distress that, when considered together, point toward impaired sleep quality. Wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration (7 h 16 min; Z = 0.10) and a normal resting heart rate (58.2 bpm; Z = 0.01) are features that by themselves are compatible with reasonably adequate sleep quantity and baseline cardiovascular recovery. However, multiple complementary indicators—markedly elevated depressive and stress symptoms, frequent napping, late and variable sleep timing, low circadian stability and amplitude, and elevated evening heart rate—are consistent with behavioral and physiological patterns that commonly accompany poorer subjective sleep quality.

Factors supporting relatively higher PSQI score (worse sleep): Psychological symptom burden is notable and strongly weighted in relation to PSQI in this sample. The participant’s CES-D score is high (27; Z = 1.42) and has one of the largest positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (r ≈ 0.49), indicating depressive symptomatology that commonly co-occurs with worse perceived sleep. Trait anxiety (STAI = 48; Z = 0.66; r ≈ 0.40) and perceived stress (PSS = 28; Z = 1.74; r ≈ 0.20) also point in the same direction. Behavioral markers linked to poorer sleep include frequent alcohol use relative to peers (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0) and substantial evening screen/internet exposure (internet use 2–3 hours; Z ≈ 0.85), both of which can delay sleep onset and fragment sleep. Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate reduced 24‑hour structure: low interdaily stability (0.24; Z = −1.40), low amplitude (6.21; Z = −1.48), and reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.21; Z = −0.95). These findings reflect a flattened and less regular heart‑rate rhythm across days, which is epidemiologically and mechanistically associated with worse sleep consolidation and poorer subjective sleep. The participant’s sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:19 AM) with non-trivial night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 69 min), and mean daily naps are elevated (0.27 naps/day; Z = 2.27). Late bedtimes combined with frequent daytime napping and blunted circadian amplitude are typical contributors to higher PSQI scores. Finally, the aggregated hourly heart-rate pattern shows relatively large evening elevations (e.g., +20 bpm vs. mesor at 8–9 pm; Zs up to ~1.85), consistent with evening physiological activation that can interfere with sleep initiation and perceived sleep quality.

Factors supporting relatively lower PSQI score (better sleep): Objective sleep quantity is within a typical range for young adults (median ≈ 7 h 16 min; Z ≈ 0.10), which reduces the likelihood that short total sleep time is the primary driver of poor subjective sleep. The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are near the study mean (resting HR Z ≈ 0.01; mesor Z ≈ −0.39), and overnight heart-rate declines are present (negative deviations across the 12–7 am window), indicating normal nocturnal autonomic downregulation. Sleep start time variability is not extreme relative to the sample (sleep start SD Z ≈ −0.31), suggesting some consistency in bedtime variability despite a late median start. Some daytime HR peaks during typical active hours (mid-morning and midday) are evident, which may reflect periods of consolidated wakefulness and activity that support total sleep need being met.

Integrated conclusion and comparison to population mean: Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward poorer subjective sleep quality: elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (strongly correlated with PSQI), high perceived stress, frequent naps, late habitual sleep timing, and markedly reduced circadian regularity and amplitude. Although nightly sleep duration and resting cardiac indices appear acceptable, these are outweighed by behavioral/psychological and circadian irregularity indicators that are robustly associated with higher PSQI scores in the study. Relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the composite profile is most consistent with a PSQI score above the population mean (i.e., worse sleep quality than typical participants). This conclusion emphasizes likely elevated subjective sleep disturbance rather than absence of sufficient sleep time; interventions that target circadian regularity, evening arousal (including evening substance and screen use), and mood/stress could plausibly improve perceived sleep quality."
59097,"Summary of risk indicators for relatively poorer sleep quality
The self-report profile contains several strong signals that typically associate with higher (worse) PSQI scores. Depressive symptom burden is elevated (CES‑D = 28, Z = 1.53) and the CES‑D has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.49), indicating that participants with similar depressive symptom levels tend to report worse sleep. Trait anxiety is also above average (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) and correlates positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.40), which increases the likelihood of greater subjective sleep disturbance (e.g., longer sleep latency, poorer perceived sleep). Self-reported happiness is low (current = 2.0, Z = -1.61) and self‑esteem is slightly below the sample mean (RSES Z = -0.31); both of these affective features have small-to-moderate negative correlations with better sleep in the study and therefore are consistent with an elevated PSQI. The participant’s sleep start time is late (median ≈ 01:07 AM), which can contribute to poor subjective sleep timing/quality even when total sleep duration appears sufficient.

Objective and behavioral indicators that support relatively better sleep quality
Several wearable-derived and behavioral metrics point toward relatively good, consolidated sleep. Nightly sleep duration is long (median 8 h 23 min, Z = 1.50) and sleep duration shows relatively low night-to-night variability (SD = 74 minutes, Z = -0.62). The participant reports essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86) and has a low SD for sleep start time (≈ 38 minutes, Z = -0.99), indicating a fairly consistent sleep schedule. Circadian/rhythm metrics derived from heart rate further reinforce regularity and consolidated rest: interdaily stability is high (0.57, Z = 1.33), intradaily variability is low (0.33, Z = -1.52), and 24‑hour autocorrelation is elevated (0.47, Z = 1.23). These features together reflect a robust and stable day–night structure with relatively few activity/rest transitions across days—patterns that are generally associated with lower (better) PSQI component scores. Nighttime heart-rate deviations (large negative deviations between ~1–6 AM) are consistent with a consolidated nocturnal rest period and a normal nocturnal dip in physiological arousal; resting heart rate itself is within the study mean range (≈ 58.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.05).

Behavioral/contextual contributors with mixed or modest impact
Other lifestyle variables show mixed or small associations with PSQI in this sample. Alcohol use at the level reported (beer/wine 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 1.0) is modest and has little correlation with PSQI here. Exercise frequency is relatively low for solo exercise but moderate for sports (sports 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 0.91); physical activity could support sleep quality but the low frequency of routine exercise reduces confidence in a strong protective effect. Socializing time is relatively high (2–3 hours, Z ≈ 0.95) but its observed correlation with PSQI is small. Body‑mass index (≈ 26.5) is slightly elevated; while BMI can impact sleep-related breathing and quality in some contexts, no direct study-specific correlation for BMI with PSQI is provided.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study mean PSQI
Taken together, the profile presents a clear discordance between subjective/psychological risk factors and objective sleep physiology. Objective wearable signals (long median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, consolidated nocturnal heart‑rate nadir, and no naps) are consistent with relatively good, regular sleep behavior and physiology. In contrast, elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, low reported happiness, and a late habitual sleep onset (≈ 1:07 AM) are notable subjective and psychological risk factors that have medium-sized correlations with worse PSQI in this sample and therefore increase the likelihood of elevated self-reported sleep problems.

Weighing these elements, the psychological symptom burden (especially the elevated CES‑D with a relatively large PSQI correlation) is likely to push the participant’s self-reported sleep quality upward (worse) relative to objective indicators. On balance, and given the study sample context (population PSQI mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the participant’s overall sleep quality as inferred from the multimodal data is more consistent with being above the population mean (i.e., worse than average). This conclusion rests primarily on the strong association between affective symptoms and PSQI in this cohort despite objectively regular and ample sleep duration; it therefore suggests discordance between objective sleep physiology and subjective sleep experience that would be expected to produce a PSQI somewhat higher than the sample mean."
24833,"Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality is present in the circadian and behavioral timing data. The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (02:10 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 85 minutes), a pattern commonly associated with sleep consolidation difficulties and poorer subjective sleep. Wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced day-to-day regularity and rhythm strength: interdaily stability is low (0.17, Z = -1.98) and 24-hour autocorrelation is also low (0.11, Z = -1.79), while cosinor amplitude is reduced (5.9, Z = -1.58). These features together imply an irregular and low-amplitude heart-rate circadian profile, which is typically linked to worse sleep quality and circadian misalignment. Additional signals that point toward elevated sleep disturbance risk include a modestly elevated resting heart rate (64.7 bpm, Z = 0.78) and a sleep-duration standard deviation near 98 minutes, indicating appreciable night-to-night variability in total sleep time. Alcohol use at a frequency of 1–2 times per week (Z ≈ 1.0) may also contribute to fragmentation or subjective sleep complaints for some individuals.

At the same time, several findings are more consistent with preserved or relatively good sleep. Median total sleep duration is close to 7 hours (6 h 55 min, Z = -0.32), which is within a commonly recommended range and less likely to drive severe PSQI elevations by itself. The participant reports low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82), both of which are protective against higher PSQI scores given the moderate positive correlations these psychopathology measures have with PSQI in the sample. Behavioral markers such as essentially no daily napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86) and modest engagement in physical activity (exercise 1–2 times/week) also tend to support consolidated nighttime sleep. Physiologically, nocturnal heart-rate deviations show the expected and relatively strong overnight dip (e.g., ~-9 to -12 bpm deviation across the 2–8 AM window with some of those hourly deviations having positive Z-scores relative to the cohort), which can reflect preserved nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation and recovery during sleep.

Integrating these multimodal signals yields a nuanced picture: the participant appears to obtain an adequate quantity of sleep on average and shows low affective symptom burden, but late and irregular sleep timing and markers of weakened circadian organization (low interdaily stability, low amplitude, low 24-h autocorrelation) are notable risk factors for poorer subjective sleep quality. Many of the individual correlations with PSQI in the sample are modest, so no single metric deterministically predicts the PSQI; however, the combination of pronounced delayed timing and circadian irregularity tends to elevate subjective sleep complaints even when total sleep time and mood are relatively preserved.

Overall, weighing the opposing influences, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is likely somewhat worse than the study sample average. In relation to the study’s population PSQI mean (6.72, SD = 2.16), the pattern of late sleep timing and reduced circadian rhythmicity suggests a PSQI level that is above the population mean (i.e., indicating somewhat poorer sleep quality than average), though not necessarily extreme given the near-normal sleep duration and low mood/anxiety symptoms.

Limitations: this interpretation is probabilistic and indirect — no PSQI score from this participant was provided, cohort-level correlations are modest, and wearable-derived metrics cannot fully capture subjective components of sleep quality (e.g., sleep latency perception, night-time awakenings). These caveats should be considered when using these inferences for decision-making or interventions."
84502,"Objective behavioral and physiological indicators in the wearable record point toward relatively good, consolidated sleep and a robust circadian profile. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 31 minutes (Z = 0.41), with no recorded daytime naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86) and a moderately low night-to-night variability in sleep-start time (SD 65 minutes, Z = -0.39). Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show relatively high interdaily stability (0.55, Z = 1.16) and a clear amplitude (12.41, Z = 0.53) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈16:08), consistent with a stable daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is low (52.6 bpm, Z = -0.66), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline (e.g., −18 to −22 bpm from mesor across the 1–6 AM window; several of these values are multiple SDs below the population mean), a pattern typically associated with consolidated, restorative nocturnal sleep. Low substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use reported), regular exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23), and relatively high health satisfaction (5.22 on a 1–7 scale, Z = 0.72) further support a behavioral context conducive to good sleep.

At the same time, self-report measures indicate psychosocial factors that commonly co-occur with poorer subjective sleep. The CES-D depressive symptom score is 18 (Z = 0.49; classified in the dataset as “Depressed”), and perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38). Both of these scales have positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (CES-D correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.49; PSS correlation ≈ 0.20), meaning higher symptom levels here are statistically associated with worse sleep quality across participants. Self-reported happiness is relatively low (3.0, Z = -0.53). These psychosocial signals increase the likelihood of worse subjective sleep quality (longer sleep latency, more awakenings, or poorer perceived sleep), even when objective sleep duration and circadian regularity appear favorable.

There are a few mixed or moderating metrics that help explain potential divergence between objective and subjective sleep indicators. Sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 109 minutes, Z = 0.18) is not extreme but is positively correlated with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.20), suggesting that some nights of shorter or longer sleep could contribute to perceived instability. Certain hourly heart-rate deviations during the early morning hours have small positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., 1–4 AM correlations up to ≈0.23), which could reflect subtle physiologic arousal on some nights that may not be visible in median-duration statistics. Conversely, several circadian regularity measures (interdaily stability Z = 1.16; 24-h autocorrelation Z = 0.81) and the low resting heart rate are associated with lower PSQI in the cohort (negative correlations), reinforcing the objective case for relatively good sleep.

Holistic interpretation: synthesizing objective wearable evidence (above-average sleep duration, strong nocturnal heart-rate decline, high interdaily stability, no naps, low substance use) with self-reported affective risk factors (moderate depressive symptoms and elevated perceived stress), the balance of evidence favors overall sleep quality that is at least as good as, and likely modestly better than, the study population average. I therefore infer that the participant’s overall sleep quality is below the population mean PSQI (i.e., likely a PSQI score lower/better than the sample mean of 6.71), while noting a realistic possibility that elevated depressive symptoms and stress could inflate the participant’s subjective PSQI relative to the objective profile. In other words: objective physiology and behavior point to better-than-average sleep, but subjective mood-related factors create a credible risk for poorer perceived sleep quality."
78783,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of behavioral and physiological features that together suggest more sleep disturbance than protection. Key behavioral patterns are a consistently late sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:51 AM) and substantial night-to-night irregularity (sleep start SD = 173 min, Z = 1.99; sleep duration SD = 151 min, Z = 1.13). Daytime napping is relatively frequent (mean daily naps = 0.26, Z = 2.23). These timing irregularities and napping tendencies are among the strongest signals in the dataset and are associated in this sample with higher PSQI scores. Although the participant’s median nightly sleep duration (~6 h 52 min) is only modestly below seven hours (Z = -0.39), the combination of late timing and high variability is typically linked to poorer perceived sleep quality and greater PSQI scores.

Factors indicating elevated PSQI (poorer sleep quality): Several measures point toward contributors to elevated PSQI. Late habitual sleep onset (median 02:51 AM) and very high variability in sleep start time (Z = 1.99) are commonly associated with greater sleep complaints and correlate positively with PSQI in these data. Frequent naps (Z = 2.23) and large night-to-night duration variability (Z = 1.13) similarly align with higher PSQI (sleep variability correlation ~0.20). Evening and late-night activity patterns reflected in wearable heart-rate deviations (elevated relative evening HR deviations and pronounced negative deviations in early-night hours that show small positive correlations with PSQI) and a high self-reported engagement in video games (Z = 1.71) may further maintain late/fragmented sleep. Affective indicators that covary with worse sleep include low current happiness (Z = -1.61) and modest trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17; STAI–PSQI correlation ~0.40), which—together with modest depressive symptom correlation with PSQI—suggest affective contributions to sleep disturbance.

Factors indicating lower PSQI (better sleep quality): The profile also includes protective features that tend to be associated with lower PSQI. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercised alone three times a week or more; exercise Z-scores up to ~1.07), which in this sample relates weakly to better PSQI. Objective cardiovascular markers indicate relatively high fitness or parasympathetic tone (resting heart rate = 52.8 bpm, Z = -0.64) and a moderately large circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = 0.49), both of which are generally associated with healthier sleep physiology and—here—have small correlations with lower PSQI. Interpersonal trust is relatively high (Z = 0.83) and may reflect social resources that can buffer stress-related sleep disruption. Overall, these protective factors are notable but smaller in magnitude than the strongest behavioral risks (especially timing irregularity and naps).

Circadian and physiological interpretation: Heart-rate circadian metrics indicate a reasonably coherent day–night rhythm but with some fragmentation. Interdaily stability is modestly low (0.36, Z = -0.41) and intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.58, Z = 0.24), consistent with less regular daily structure. The cosinor-derived amplitude is somewhat above average (Z = 0.49) and the mesor is slightly low (Z = -0.58), while acrophase (~6:24 PM) is a typical evening peak. Aggregated hourly deviations show strong negative deviations across core sleep hours (large negative HR deviations overnight) and positive deviations across the afternoon/evening; these patterns are physiologically consistent with consolidated sleep at night but do not negate the behavioral signal of late and irregular sleep timing. Taken together, the circadian heart-rate data suggest a detectable 24-hour rhythm but one accompanied by behavioral irregularity that likely undermines subjective sleep quality.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of salient indicators—especially very late median sleep onset, high variability in sleep timing and duration, and elevated napping—point toward greater sleep disruption and a higher PSQI than average. Although cardiorespiratory fitness and frequent exercise are protective counterweights, they appear insufficient to offset the behavioral patterns most strongly associated with worse sleep. Therefore, the participant’s overall sleep quality is best characterized as above the study population mean PSQI (i.e., poorer than average within this sample). This inference is driven primarily by timing irregularity and napping (large positive Z-scores) and supported by affective factors that tend to co-occur with higher PSQI in this cohort."
25197,"Summary of risk indicators for poorer sleep quality
The participant exhibits several behavioral and self-report features that are commonly associated with higher PSQI scores. Sleep timing is late: the median sleep start time is 01:45 AM, and median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 34 minutes (Z = -0.77), indicating shorter-than-average sleep in this sample. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86), and perceived stress is above average (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92); both measures have positive correlations with PSQI in the study (STAI r ≈ 0.40, PSS r ≈ 0.20) and are therefore plausibly contributing to worse subjective sleep. Alcohol consumption at a weekly frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.0) is present and, although weakly correlated with PSQI in this sample, can exacerbate sleep fragmentation and subjective sleep quality for some individuals. Taken together, late bedtimes, somewhat short sleep duration, higher anxiety, and elevated perceived stress point toward drivers of relatively poorer sleep.

Summary of protective indicators for better sleep quality
Multiple physiological and behavioral features indicate relatively preserved or robust sleep physiology and schedule regularity that would tend to lower PSQI scores. Wearable-derived circadian measures show a reasonably strong 24‑hour amplitude (amplitude = 12.77, Z = 0.64) and low intradaily variability (IV = 0.47, Z = -0.53), which reflect consolidated daily structure and lower fragmentation of activity/physiology — patterns usually associated with better sleep consolidation. Resting heart rate is low (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68), and nocturnal heart-rate deviations are large and appropriately negative (nighttime hourly deviations down to ~-22 bpm in the 4–6 AM window; Z’s ~ -0.6 to -1.0), consistent with preserved nocturnal autonomic downregulation. The participant reports no daytime naps (Z = -0.86) and relatively low night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep start time (sleep duration SD = 61 minutes, Z = -0.91; sleep start SD = 56 minutes, Z = -0.58), which indicate a degree of consistency that typically supports sleep quality. Self-reported health satisfaction is high (6.44 on a 1–7 scale, Z = 1.63), and functioning indicators (e.g., academic performance) are strong; these features are also loosely associated with better perceived sleep in the study.

Integrated interpretation and likely position relative to the study sample
Evidence points to a mixed profile: psychosocial risk factors (notably elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress) and late, somewhat short sleep episodes push toward a higher PSQI, whereas physiological signatures (robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability, pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate decline), consistency in sleep timing/duration, absence of naps, and low resting heart rate suggest a physiologically resilient pattern that supports sleep quality. On balance, given the relatively strong signal from elevated anxiety/stress combined with late sleep timing and reduced total sleep time — and recognizing that the circadian/physiological markers provide a meaningful protective influence — the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s overall sleep quality is near the study population mean but modestly worse than average. Stated relative to the sample PSQI distribution (population mean PSQI = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile is best characterized as near the mean, leaning slightly above the population mean (i.e., somewhat poorer sleep than average), rather than clearly far above or well below the sample mean.

Implications for targeted evaluation or intervention
If the goal is to reduce PSQI score or improve sleep quality, prioritizing interventions that address elevated anxiety and evening timing would likely be most effective given the current profile: strategies to reduce pre‑sleep cognitive/emotional arousal (brief cognitive-behavioral sleep strategies, relaxation or stimulus-control components) and to shift sleep timing earlier (gradual circadian phase adjustments, consistent morning light exposure, evening light/screen minimization) could leverage the participant’s intact circadian amplitude and physiological sleep consolidation to produce measurable gains. Monitoring subjective sleep quality in parallel with wearable indicators would help determine whether reductions in anxiety and earlier sleep timing translate into lower PSQI-consistent symptom burden."
23270,"Summary of protective indicators (evidence favoring relatively good sleep quality):
The wearable-recorded sleep pattern is marked by a long median nightly sleep duration of 8 hours 49 minutes (Z = +2.03), a relatively early and consistent sleep start time (median 22:50; SD of start time 79 minutes, Z ≈ -0.09), and virtually no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Cardiovascular signatures during the night show a clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir: hourly deviations from the mesor during core sleep hours are large and negative (approximately -15 to -19 bpm for the 12–6 AM window, Z-scores as low as -1.9 to -0.05), and the participant’s resting heart rate is comparatively low (54.9 bpm, Z = -0.39). Lifestyle and survey indicators that typically support sleep quality are also present: regular and frequent exercise (exercise and sports frequencies Z = +1.07 to +1.58), no reported alcohol or recreational drug use (Z-scores strongly negative), positive health satisfaction (score = 5/7, Z = +0.55), and low perceived stress (PSS = 19, Z = -0.71). Collectively these elements point toward adequate opportunity for sleep, strong nocturnal physiological down-regulation, and behavioral practices that generally favor lower PSQI scores.

Summary of risk indicators (evidence favoring relatively poorer sleep quality):
There are a few features that could push toward higher PSQI scores. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 47, Z = +0.56), and trait anxiety shows a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.40), indicating that anxiety-prone individuals in this cohort tend to report worse sleep. Depressive symptom score is modest (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and less suggestive of risk, but the sample-level correlation between CES-D and PSQI is sizeable (r ≈ 0.49), so even moderate mood symptoms are relevant. From the wearable circadian metrics, interdaily stability is slightly below average (value = 0.38, Z = -0.24) and intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (value = 0.60, Z = +0.39), which together indicate a modestly fragmented or less tightly regular 24-hour pattern; although these circadian metrics have small correlations with PSQI in the study, they can reflect irregularity that sometimes undermines perceived sleep quality. Sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 94 minutes) and sleep-start variability (SD ≈ 79 minutes) are not extreme but indicate some night-to-night variation that could contribute to intermittent poor-sleep nights.

Circadian and physiological pattern interpretation:
The participant shows a robust nocturnal cardiac downshift and a prominent daytime rise in heart rate (morning hours show large positive deviations relative to the mesor, with particularly high deviations during mid-morning). The cosinor-derived MESOR (≈ 69.5, Z = -0.61) and amplitude (≈ 10.7, Z ≈ -0.02) do not indicate blunted rhythmicity; the acrophase near mid-afternoon (~2:42 PM) is within a typical daytime timing. These features together suggest physiologically normal sleep–wake segregation (clear nighttime parasympathetic dominance and daytime sympathetic predominance), which commonly aligns with restorative sleep. The modestly elevated intradaily variability indicates some daytime–nighttime fragmentation in heart-rate patterns, but the overall cardiac rhythm retains reasonable structure.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population:
Balancing the evidence, this participant demonstrates multiple strong indicators of good objective sleep opportunity and physiology (notably long median sleep duration, consistent sleep start time, absence of naps/substance use, and pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reduction), alongside a few psychosocial and circadian features that could modestly increase subjective sleep complaints (elevated trait anxiety and slight circadian fragmentation). On net, the preponderance of objective and behavioral evidence points to sleep quality that is better than the study population average. Therefore, relative to the sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., relatively better sleep). This overall judgment should be tempered by the participant’s elevated trait anxiety and modest rhythm variability, which are plausible contributors to occasional or subjective sleep disturbance despite generally favorable objective indicators."
70125,"Psychosocial and self-report indicators that would be expected to push the participant toward a higher (worse) PSQI score are prominent. Depressive symptom burden is elevated (CES‑D = 24; Z = 1.11) and shows a relatively strong positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.49). Trait anxiety is also above the sample mean (STAI = 50; Z = 0.86; r ≈ 0.40). Perceived stress is markedly high (PSS = 29; Z = 2.01), and although its correlation with PSQI is modest (r ≈ 0.20), the combination of elevated depression, anxiety, and stress constitutes a cluster of psychological risk factors that, in aggregate, are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. Behavioral items that align with poorer sleep are also present: the participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 01:44 AM) and night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD = 159 minutes, Z = 1.32; correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.20). These irregular and late sleep timing features are consistent with a pattern that typically relates to greater sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological markers provide additional evidence consistent with disrupted sleep timing and regulation. Circadian regularity metrics are lower than the study average (interdaily stability = 0.34, Z = -0.57; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.24, Z = -0.70), and modelled circadian amplitude is reduced (amplitude = 9.18, Z = -0.52), which together indicate a relatively blunted and less stable 24‑hour heart‑rate rhythm across the recording period. These features are interpretable as reduced circadian strength and day‑to‑day regularity—conditions that are mechanistically and empirically linked to worse sleep consolidation and subjective sleep quality. In addition, aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show relatively high evening cardiovascular activation (peak deviation at 7–8 PM = +17.4 bpm, Z = 1.03) alongside the expected nocturnal heart‑rate nadir (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM, e.g., 4–5 AM = -21.8 bpm). The elevated evening arousal signal could be contributing to later sleep onset and poorer sleep initiation even though nocturnal decline in heart rate is preserved.

There are several factors that point toward preserved or relatively good sleep-relevant functioning, which would favor a lower (better) PSQI score. Median nightly sleep duration is near seven hours (6 h 57 m; Z = -0.29), which is within commonly recommended ranges and does not by itself indicate short sleep. The participant reports very low daytime napping (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08, Z ≈ 0.12) and limited passive media exposure (e.g., TV and music time low), reducing some behavioral contributors to fragmented night sleep. Resting heart rate is relatively low (RHR = 53 bpm; Z = -0.61), a marker that often reflects cardiovascular fitness and is sometimes associated with better sleep physiology. Exercise frequency (exercised alone three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.07) is higher than average in this sample and generally protective with respect to sleep quality.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the evidence, the participant shows a mixed profile but with stronger signals pointing toward worse subjective sleep quality. High depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, marked perceived stress, late and variable sleep timing, and objective indicators of reduced circadian amplitude and day‑to‑day regularity are collectively more predictive of elevated PSQI than the mitigating features (near‑7‑hour median sleep, low naps, regular exercise, low RHR). Accordingly, the participant’s overall sleep quality as inferred from these multimodal data is likely above the study population mean PSQI (population mean PSQI = 6.72). In other words, the pattern of psychosocial risk plus circadian irregularity suggests sleep quality that is poorer than average in this sample, despite some protective behaviors that may partially buffer sleep disturbance.

Clinical and measurement caveats: these inferences integrate correlated self‑report and wearable markers but do not constitute a diagnostic determination. Correlations between individual metrics and PSQI in the sample are modest for several wearable measures (many r values near zero), so conclusions rely on the combined pattern rather than any single strong sensor signal. If the goal is to reduce sleep complaints, the most actionable targets suggested by the data are (a) interventions to reduce evening physiological/psychological arousal and to shift/moderate the late sleep onset, and (b) addressing elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress, all of which are the strongest predictors here of poorer sleep."
67192,"Summary: The participant’s data show a mixed pattern of objective wearable rhythms and self-reported psychological/lifestyle risk factors. Wearable-derived circadian features indicate a fairly coherent 24-hour structure (interdaily stability = 0.52, Z = 0.91; autocorrelation at 24h Z = 1.23) with modest amplitude (12.27, Z = 0.48) and relatively low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.50, Z = -0.32). Median nightly sleep duration (7 h 16 m, Z = 0.10) is near the study population average, and mean daily naps are minimal (0.13, Z = 0.70). At the same time, several psychological, behavioral and physiological indicators point toward elevated sleep disturbance risk.

Evidence pointing toward poorer sleep quality (predicting higher PSQI): Psychopathology and stress are notable — CES-D = 32 (Z = 1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI) = 58 (Z = 1.65), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.50; STAI correlation ≈ 0.40). Perceived stress is high (PSS = 31, Z = 2.55), and self-rated health satisfaction and happiness are low (health satisfaction Z = -2.03; happiness Z = -1.61), which are associated with worse subjective sleep. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mean cardiac mesor are elevated (resting HR = 71.8 bpm, Z = 1.62; MESOR = 88.67, Z = 2.01), and there is a relatively large evening/nighttime deviation pattern — notably a pronounced positive deviation around 10–11 pm (10–11 pm = +16.3 bpm relative to mesor, Z = 1.55). Elevated evening heart rate and higher baseline mesor suggest greater physiological arousal in the evening and across the day, which often accompanies poorer sleep quality. Behaviorally, the participant’s typical sleep start time is late (median start ~01:15) with high night-to-night variability (sleep-start SD ≈ 110 minutes, Z = 0.59); inconsistent and late bedtimes are commonly linked to worse subjective sleep. High evening/bedtime screen and media use (video games, TV, internet; Zs up to ~2.5 for socializing and video games) and frequent late social activity may also contribute to pre-sleep arousal and delayed sleep timing.

Evidence pointing toward better sleep quality (predicting lower PSQI): Objectively measured total sleep time is in a range consistent with adequate sleep for many adults (median ≈ 7 h 16 m), and the participant does not show extensive napping, which reduces daytime sleep pressure disruption. Circadian regularity metrics are not poor — interdaily stability is above average (Z ≈ 0.91) and 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively strong (Z ≈ 1.23), indicating that the participant’s day-to-day timing pattern is reasonably consistent overall despite late timing. Intradaily variability is slightly lower than the cohort mean (Z ≈ -0.32), which suggests less fragmentation of activity across the day-night cycle. These objective features (adequate median sleep time, low napping, preserved interdaily regularity) are factors that would push toward a lower PSQI score.

Synthesis and overall comparison to the sample mean PSQI: Balancing the signals, the strongest drivers of likely poor subjective sleep are the high depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, substantial perceived stress, elevated resting cardiac tone and evening physiological arousal, and a late, inconsistent sleep schedule accompanied by substantial evening screen/social activity. These signals have relatively strong empirical associations with higher PSQI in this dataset (notably CES-D and STAI). Countervailing evidence — median total sleep time near typical values, low napping, and preserved interdaily rhythmicity — mitigates but does not fully offset the cumulative risk. On balance, the pattern is more consistent with a PSQI above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). In other words, the participant’s overall profile more likely corresponds to worse-than-average sleep quality compared with the sample, driven particularly by psychological distress, elevated physiological arousal, and late/inconsistent bedtimes.

Notes on uncertainty: This inference leans on symptom scales and aggregated circadian/heart-rate markers rather than a direct PSQI score. Several objective features (total sleep time, interdaily stability) argue against severe objective sleep restriction, so the predicted elevation in PSQI is driven largely by subjective distress and evening arousal rather than a clear loss of total sleep time."
97448,"Summary of multimodal pattern:
Across wearable and self-report measures the participant shows a coherent pattern of a fairly regular, robust circadian rhythm combined with a late but consistent sleep schedule. Wearable-derived circadian metrics are notable for relatively high interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and large circadian amplitude (14.78, Z = 1.29), and the 24-hour autocorrelation is also above average (0.46, Z = 1.15). Nighttime heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal dip (large negative deviations from the mesor across ~1:00–8:00 AM), consistent with consolidated nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 12 minutes (Z = 0.02) with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 63 minutes, Z = -0.86). Self-report measures show low depressive (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07) and anxiety symptoms (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82), regular exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.07), and minimal napping (mean daily naps = 0.13, Z = 0.7).

Features that point toward higher (worse) PSQI scores:
The most salient potential source of poorer sleep quality is the late median sleep start time (01:44 AM). Although timing is consistent (sleep start SD = 63 minutes, Z = -0.43), going to sleep well after midnight can be associated in many samples with greater subjective sleep problems, daytime impairment, or circadian misalignment with typical daytime obligations. Weekly alcohol use (beer/wine or liquor 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) is present; while low-frequency, alcohol close to bedtime can fragment sleep and worsen subjective sleep quality for some individuals. Self-reported current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53), and population-level correlations in this dataset show modest positive associations between depressive/anxiety symptoms and PSQI (CES-D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40), indicating that any increases in symptoms would likely track with worse PSQI — although this participant’s current symptom levels are low. Finally, some small positive correlations in the dataset link variability in sleep timing and duration to worse PSQI (sleep duration SD r = 0.20; sleep start SD r = 0.18), so any increases in variability could raise risk.

Features that point toward lower (better) PSQI scores:
Multiple objective and subjective indicators favor relatively good sleep quality. Total sleep time is in a normative range (median ≈ 7 h 12 min) and the variability in sleep duration is lower than the study mean, both of which generally support better sleep quality and efficiency. Robust circadian structure — higher interdaily stability and amplitude and above-average 24-hour autocorrelation — typically corresponds to more consolidated sleep and better subjective sleep outcomes; in this dataset those circadian features show negative correlations with PSQI or only weak positive correlations (suggesting protective effects). Resting heart rate is relatively low (50.8 bpm, Z = -0.87), a pattern often associated with better cardiovascular fitness and less physiological arousal during rest. Behavioral and psychological profiles are supportive of sleep health: regular exercise, low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, minimal recreational drug use, and limited napping are all factors that, in the sample correlations and the broader literature, tend to predict better PSQI scores.

Integrated conclusion relative to the study sample:
Balancing the evidence, the participant’s objective sleep and circadian markers (adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, strong circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline, low resting heart rate), together with low depressive/anxiety symptoms and regular exercise, point toward relatively good sleep quality. The main factor moderating that conclusion is the late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:44 AM) and modest weekly alcohol use, which could increase subjective sleep problems or daytime impairment for some individuals. On balance, the data are most consistent with the participant having overall sleep quality at or somewhat better than the study population average. Compared to the study mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the pattern of indicators suggests a PSQI level likely below the population mean (i.e., relatively better sleep quality than average), rather than substantially above it. This inference should be interpreted cautiously because PSQI includes subjective aspects (sleep quality, sleep latency, disturbances) that are only partially captured by the available wearable and survey metrics; direct PSQI score would provide the definitive comparison."
67177,"Wearable-derived physiological and sleep metrics indicate a relatively coherent circadian organization with generally consolidated nocturnal physiology. Interdaily stability is high (0.56; Z = 1.24) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.49; Z = 1.40), while intradaily variability is relatively low (0.44; Z = -0.74). These features together suggest stable day-to-day timing of activity and limited within-day fragmentation. Hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations between ~1:00–6:00 AM, with a nadir around -20 bpm), consistent with extended epochs of low physiological arousal overnight. Cosinor-derived metrics show a moderately elevated mesor (82.08 bpm; Z = 1.11) and a normal-to-high amplitude (13.32; Z = 0.82), and resting heart rate is modestly elevated (65.2 bpm; Z = 0.84). Wearable sleep summaries show a median sleep duration of 6 hours 54 minutes (Z = -0.35) with no observed daytime napping and a median sleep start near 00:22 with moderate night-to-night start-time variability (SD ≈ 87 minutes). Taken together, the wearable data point to reasonably regular, consolidated sleep physiology but with slightly shortened total sleep time and mild elevations in baseline cardiovascular activation.

Self-report and behavioral measures provide several signals associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 16; Z = 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46), both of which have the largest positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40, respectively). Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 25; Z = 0.92) and current happiness is low (score = 2.0; Z = -1.61). Behavioral patterns that can degrade sleep—late median sleep start (~00:22), low levels of physical exercise (reported “not at all”; exercise Z-scores very negative), prolonged evening screen/media use (TV/videos 1–2 hours, internet 2–3 hours, listening to music 2–3 hours with positive Z-scores), and elevated BMI (30.04)—also favor a higher subjective PSQI. Several of these psychological variables (depression, anxiety, stress) show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample, indicating they are likely to contribute meaningfully to worse self-reported sleep quality.

There are multiple factors that argue in the direction of relatively preserved or better sleep quality. The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol, no recreational/non-prescribed drugs), no daytime napping, and wearable circadian metrics indicate strong regularity (high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, low intradaily variability) that are typically associated with healthier sleep timing and continuity. The nocturnal heart-rate decline is pronounced and consistent with consolidated sleep. Median total sleep time, while slightly below the study mean (≈6 h 54 m; Z = -0.35), is near the commonly recommended minimum for many adults and is not profoundly short. These protective elements—regular circadian timing, absence of evening naps and substances, and physiological indication of consolidated sleep—temper the impact of the psychosocial risks.

Balancing the evidence, the most salient drivers of higher PSQI in this profile are the psychological symptom burden (depressive and anxiety symptoms) and elevated perceived stress together with late evening habits and low physical activity. The most salient protective signals are strong circadian regularity and physiological evidence of consolidated nocturnal sleep, plus little or no substance use and no naps. Because the psychological and behavioral risk factors are strongly associated with PSQI in the sample (notably CES‑D and STAI) and are moderate in magnitude for this participant, while physiological markers and sleep duration are only mildly protective, the overall pattern is more consistent with a PSQI score that is modestly worse than the sample average.

Compared to the study population mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the integrated profile of this participant is best described as likely above the population mean (i.e., poorer sleep quality than average), though not necessarily extreme. This inference is probabilistic: the wearable data reduce the likelihood of very severe sleep fragmentation, but the psychological symptom burden and late sleep timing increase the probability of elevated subjective sleep disturbance. Limitations to this inference include the absence of a direct PSQI score for the participant, the cross-sectional/correlational nature of associations, and the temporally aggregated heart-rate summary (which prevents examination of night-by-night variability). If clinical or research decisions depend on a precise PSQI estimate, administration of the PSQI and/or targeted follow-up on mood, stress, and evening routines would be appropriate next steps."
87328,"Summary of data sources and analytic approach: The following interpretation integrates self-report measures, wearable-derived sleep statistics, hourly heart-rate aggregates, and circadian rhythm features to identify behavioral and physiological patterns that, based on their known associations with PSQI scores in the study population, are likely to push the participant’s PSQI higher (worse sleep quality) or lower (better sleep quality). Correlations and Z-scores provided in the dataset guided the directional weight of each feature; conclusions are probabilistic rather than diagnostic.

Factors that favour a relatively higher PSQI (features suggesting poorer sleep quality)
- Late habitual sleep onset: The participant’s median sleep start time is 01:26 AM, which indicates a regular, late sleep schedule. Late bedtimes are commonly associated with circadian misalignment and can be linked to lower sleep efficiency or daytime impairment even when total sleep duration is acceptable. Although a direct correlation between sleep start time and PSQI is not provided, late timing increases risk for sleep disturbance in many behavioral models.
- Evening sedentary and screen-based activities: High self-reported time watching TV/videos/movies (3–4 hours, Z = 2.54) and elevated time listening to music and video gaming (Zs ~1.6–1.7) point to substantial evening sedentary screen time. These behaviors have small positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (e.g., watching TV correlation ≈ 0.14), suggesting that evening media use may marginally worsen subjective sleep quality.
- Small but present nap use: Mean daily naps (0.18/day, Z = 1.21) and its modest positive correlation with PSQI (0.17) indicate that naps occur at somewhat higher-than-average frequency and may contribute to night-to-night sleep fragmentation or perceived poor sleep for some individuals.
- Lower self-rated health satisfaction and elevated BMI: Health satisfaction is relatively low (Z ≈ -1.2) and BMI is in the overweight range (27.1). While correlations with PSQI are modest in this dataset, lower perceived health and higher BMI can contribute to sleep complaints for some participants (e.g., discomfort, fragmented sleep) and therefore represent potential risk factors.

Factors that favour a relatively lower PSQI (features suggesting better sleep quality)
- Adequate and relatively stable sleep duration: The wearable-derived median sleep duration is 7 hours 25 minutes (Z = 0.30), with a sleep-duration standard deviation of 76 minutes (Z = -0.57) and a sleep start-time SD of 50 minutes (Z = -0.72). These values indicate that the participant obtains an average-to-above-average amount of nocturnal sleep and maintains relatively low night-to-night variability, both of which are generally associated with better subjective sleep quality.
- Strong, regular circadian rhythms and nocturnal heart-rate profile: Circadian measures derived from heart rate show several strengths: interdaily stability = 0.53 (Z = 1.0), autocorrelation at 24 h (Z = 1.57), and amplitude (Z = 1.78). The aggregated hourly deviations show robust nocturnal bradycardia (large negative deviations from mesor overnight) and pronounced daytime/evening increases in heart rate (peak around 6–7 PM). In this dataset, higher circadian amplitude and greater stability generally correlate with lower PSQI (amplitude correlation ≈ -0.11; interdaily stability correlation ≈ -0.07). A low resting heart rate (54.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.45) further supports a physiologically restorative nocturnal state.
- Low mood and anxiety symptom burden, and positive psychosocial indicators: The participant reports minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0, Z ≈ -1.38) and very low trait anxiety (STAI = 23, Z ≈ -1.81). Given the moderate positive correlations between depressive/anxiety symptoms and PSQI in this study (CES-D corr ≈ 0.50, STAI corr ≈ 0.40), these low symptom levels are strongly protective against poor subjective sleep. High self-esteem (Z ≈ 1.66) and relatively high happiness (Z ≈ 1.64) also correlate in the dataset with better sleep (self-esteem corr ≈ -0.36; happiness corr ≈ -0.27), further reducing expected PSQI.

Integrative evaluation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI
Weighing the evidence, the participant displays multiple substantial protective signals for subjective sleep quality: adequate and stable total sleep time, robust and regular heart-rate circadian rhythms with clear nocturnal decline, low depression and anxiety scores, and favorable psychosocial measures. Against these are notable risk factors—regularly late bedtime, high evening screen/sedentary activities, some daytime napping, and lower self-rated health—that could degrade perceived sleep quality for this individual. Taken together, the balance of evidence favors better-than-average sleep quality relative to the study sample. In other words, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI score below the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). This conclusion is probabilistic: late sleep timing and evening behaviors introduce measurable upward pressure on PSQI, but the strong circadian regularity and low affective symptom burden are expected to keep the participant’s PSQI below the population average rather than above it.

Caveats
- The inference above is probabilistic and uses population correlations to weight indicators; it does not substitute for a direct PSQI score. If a precise PSQI assessment is required, use of the participant’s actual PSQI total score and sleep-efficiency measures would be definitive.
- Several behavioral risks (late bedtime, evening screen time) are modifiable and could change the balance of risk if behaviors or context shift (e.g., increased stress, more evening social obligations)."
49497,"Indicators consistent with relatively poor sleep quality
Several converging signals in the self-report and wearable data point toward factors that commonly accompany higher PSQI scores. Psychologically, the participant reports very elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 49, Z = 3.71) and high trait anxiety (STAI = 64, Z = 2.24); these measures have the largest correlations with PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating strong association with poorer subjective sleep. Self-esteem is low (RSES = 22, Z = −2.28; correlation with PSQI r ≈ −0.35), another trait linked to worse sleep. Behavioral risk factors include frequent recreational and non‑prescribed drug use (high Z-scores), which—despite weak direct correlations reported in the sample—are plausibly disruptive to sleep physiology and sleep continuity. Sleep-timing irregularity is marked: median sleep start is late at ~01:14 AM and the standard deviation of sleep start time is very large (SD = 204 minutes, Z = 2.65) and the SD of sleep duration is elevated (148 minutes, Z = 1.06); both variability metrics are typically associated with fragmented or unsatisfactory sleep and in this dataset show positive correlations with PSQI. Finally, wearable-derived non‑parametric circadian features show low interdaily stability (0.21, Z = −1.65) and reduced amplitude (Z = −1.56), consistent with a weak/irregular circadian pattern that tends to accompany poorer subjective sleep.

Indicators consistent with relatively good sleep quality
There are also some features that would tend to mitigate sleep problems or are neutral. Median nightly sleep duration (6 h 30 min, Z = −0.85) is slightly below the study mean but not extremely short; the participant also shows a very low mean daily nap frequency (0.07 naps/day), which reduces the likelihood of substantial homeostatic disruption from daytime napping. The participant reports exercising alone three or more times per week (Z ≈ 1.07), a behavior generally associated with better sleep consolidation (exercise correlation with PSQI in this sample is small but negative). Resting heart rate and MESOR are near the study mean (RHR ≈ 60.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.29; MESOR Z ≈ 0.23), which do not indicate persistent physiological hyperarousal at rest. On balance, these protective/neutral features reduce but do not eliminate evidence for sleep disturbance.

Wearable heart‑rate circadian structure and hourly physiology
Heart-rate cosinor and hourly deviation metrics indicate a detectable nocturnal dip but a relatively low-amplitude, less stable circadian rhythm. The cosinor amplitude is reduced (Z ≈ −1.56) and interdaily stability is low (Z ≈ −1.65), while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z ≈ 0.60); together these suggest a circadian rhythm that is blunted and somewhat fragmented across days. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected overnight decreases but also a relative elevation in the late evening (notably a positive deviation at 10–11 pm, Z ≈ 1.29) that could reflect evening physiological arousal or activity close to bedtime and be unfavorable for sleep onset. These objective rhythm features align with the marked variability in sleep timing and together indicate circadian irregularity likely to impair subjective sleep quality.

Holistic assessment relative to the study population
Weighing the evidence, the strongest drivers in the dataset for poorer sleep are very high depressive and anxiety symptom burdens, large variability in sleep timing, reduced circadian stability/amplitude, and substantial substance use. Protective factors (moderate habitual exercise, low napping, and a median sleep duration that is not extremely short) are present but relatively weak in offsetting the risk signals. Given this pattern and the associations observed in the sample, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being above the study population mean PSQI (i.e., worse sleep than average in this sample, whose mean PSQI = 6.72). The combination of psychological distress and circadian irregularity are the primary contributors to this inference."
33785,"The participant’s self-report profile contains several psychological indicators that are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 27, Z = 1.42) and trait anxiety (STAI = 56, Z = 1.45) are both elevated relative to the study sample, and both measures show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40). Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES Z = −0.87), and although the correlation with PSQI is negative (r = −0.35), this low self-esteem would be expected to further relate to worse sleep in many individuals. Perceived stress in this assessment is not elevated (PSS score 19, Z = −0.71) and health satisfaction is slightly above average, but the combination of marked depressive and anxious symptom burden stands out as a salient risk factor for elevated PSQI (poorer subjective sleep).

Objective and circadian physiology derived from wearables present a largely regular and consolidated daily rhythm, which would typically be protective for sleep. Interdaily stability is modestly above the sample mean (0.48, Z = 0.58) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.45, Z = 1.06), indicating consistent day-to-day timing of heart-rate rhythms. Intradaily variability is substantially lower than the sample (0.25, Z = −2.08), reflecting low fragmentation of the circadian activity pattern; such low intradaily variability is usually associated with better sleep consolidation. MESOR and amplitude of the heart rate rhythm are near the sample mean (MESOR 76.8, Z = 0.39; amplitude 12.5, Z = 0.54) and the acrophase around 4:49 PM is within a typical daytime range. Resting heart rate is normal (58.7 bpm), which also argues against chronically elevated physiological arousal across the day.

Despite generally regular rhythms, there is evidence of relatively elevated physiological activation in the late evening that could interfere with sleep initiation. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show a pronounced daytime–evening rise and, importantly, an above-average deviation at 10–11 pm (+14.0 bpm, Z = 1.19). This evening elevation suggests greater sympathetic or behavioral arousal in the hour before typical sleep onset; paired with a median sleep-start time near 00:39 (about 12:40 AM), this pattern could reflect delayed sleep timing and pre-sleep activation that make sleep initiation more effortful. Nighttime heart-rate nadirs (around 4–6 AM, down ~ −23 bpm) are robust, indicating intact nocturnal slowing once sleep is established.

Sleep quantity and timing metrics measured by the wearable are generally within or slightly better than sample averages, which would favor lower PSQI scores. Median sleep duration is 7 hours 20 minutes (Z = 0.18), a duration that typically meets recommended ranges for young adults. Night-to-night variability in sleep start time is relatively low (SD 49 minutes, Z = −0.75), and naps are infrequent (mean daily naps 0.07, Z ≈ 0), all features consistent with stable sleep opportunity and consolidation. However, overall sleep duration variability (SD 110 minutes, Z = 0.20) shows some night-to-night differences in total sleep that could intermittently degrade subjective sleep quality.

Behavioral context includes both protective and risk-bearing elements. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07), which is modestly protective for sleep. Conversely, high engagement in sedentary hobbies and video games (sedentary hobby Z = 2.01; video gaming Z = 2.47) and a relatively late median bedtime may contribute to pre-sleep cognitive or behavioral arousal and delayed timing of sleep. Alcohol and recreational drug use are infrequent, which reduces one potential source of sleep disruption.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study sample mean PSQI: weighing the evidence, the strongest signals for poorer sleep are elevated depressive and anxiety symptomatology (CES-D and STAI, each >1 SD above the sample mean and moderately correlated with PSQI), and objectively elevated evening heart rate just before typical sleep onset (10–11 pm, Z = 1.19), which suggests physiological or behavioral arousal around bedtime. Counterbalancing these risks are objective markers of healthy sleep quantity (median 7 h 20 m), low intradaily variability (high consolidation), stable bedtimes (low sleep-start SD), infrequent napping, regular exercise, and normal resting heart rate. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely near to, but somewhat worse than, the study sample mean—i.e., slightly above the population mean PSQI of 6.72 (indicating marginally poorer sleep than average). This conclusion emphasizes elevated psychological symptom burden and pre-sleep arousal as the principal factors that could raise subjective sleep complaints despite largely adequate objective sleep duration and circadian regularity."
33009,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of signals. Objective wearable sleep measures indicate relatively long and consistent nocturnal sleep (median ~7 h 54 min, low night-to-night variability, no naps), and heart-rate hourly patterns show a clear nocturnal trough, all of which typically associate with better sleep quality. In contrast, circadian rhythm summary metrics (reduced amplitude, reduced interdaily stability and modestly elevated intradaily variability) and a fairly late median sleep onset (~00:51) point toward some circadian blunting/irregularity or delayed timing that can contribute to poorer subjective sleep. Self-reported mood and lifestyle measures are largely neutral-to-protective (low depressive symptoms, modest perceived stress, high self-esteem) but include weekly alcohol use and modest trait anxiety. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests overall sleep quality that is at least average or somewhat better than the study population mean.

Objective sleep and wearable-derived behavior: Wearable-recorded sleep duration is relatively robust (median 7 h 54 min; Z = +0.89) and night-to-night variability is low (SD ≈ 55 min; Z = −1.03). The participant reports essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0; Z = −0.86). These three features—adequate duration, low variability, and minimal napping—are canonical markers of consolidated nocturnal sleep and generally predict lower PSQI scores. Hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal dip (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM of around −13 to −15 bpm relative to the mesor), consistent with sustained overnight rest. The daytime heart-rate peaks (notably mid-morning and afternoon) support a day–night separation in physiological arousal.

Circadian rhythm and heart-rate summary metrics: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics indicate a relatively low-amplitude, lower-stability rhythm. MESOR is somewhat below sample mean (Z ≈ −0.71) and amplitude is reduced (Z ≈ −0.92), while interdaily stability is below average (Z ≈ −0.49) and intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z ≈ +0.53). Reduced amplitude and stability together suggest a less strongly entrained or blunted circadian rhythm; elevated intradaily variability indicates more within-day fragmentation of activity/rest states. These circadian features can be associated with worse subjective sleep quality, even when total sleep time is adequate, because they reflect timing irregularity and lower rhythmic robustness.

Self-report psychosocial and lifestyle factors: Depressive symptoms are low-moderate (CES-D = 9; Z = −0.45), trait anxiety is near the study mean (STAI = 40; Z = −0.13), and perceived stress is below average (PSS Z = −0.71). Self-esteem is slightly above average (Z = +0.26). These psychological indicators overall are more consistent with better sleep quality (depressive symptoms and higher stress are among the strongest survey correlates with poor PSQI in the sample). Alcohol use (wine or liquor ~1–2 times per week; Z = +0.94) is higher than many peers and can negatively affect sleep continuity or subjective sleep quality, particularly if consumed near bedtime. Physical activity frequency is modest (exercise 1–2×/week), which is neutral-to-modestly protective but not strongly promotive of sleep benefits.

Factors that appear likely to indicate relatively higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality)
- Reduced circadian amplitude and lower interdaily stability (amplitude Z ≈ −0.92; interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.49): these indicate blunted and less regular circadian organization, which is associated with higher PSQI in prior work.
- Elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.53): suggests more fragmentation of activity/rest across the day and is plausibly linked to worse subjective sleep.
- Late median sleep start time (~00:51): later timing can coincide with circadian misalignment and can worsen subjective sleep quality for some individuals.
- Weekly alcohol use (wine/liquor ~1–2×/week; Z ≈ +0.94): alcohol—especially if consumed in the evening—can increase sleep fragmentation and reduce subjective sleep quality.

Factors that appear likely to indicate relatively lower PSQI (better sleep quality)
- Substantial nocturnal sleep duration (median ≈ 7 h 54 min; Z ≈ +0.89): robust total sleep time is one of the strongest protective factors for PSQI.
- Low night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 55 minutes; Z ≈ −1.03) and modest variability in sleep onset time (SD ≈ 55 minutes; Z ≈ −0.61): regularity of timing and duration favors better subjective sleep.
- Absence of daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0; Z ≈ −0.86): consistent nocturnal sleep and lack of napping reduce sleep disruption risk.
- No elevation in depressive symptoms or perceived stress (CES-D and PSS both below sample mean) and slightly higher self-esteem: these psychosocial features correlate with lower PSQI in the sample and are likely protective.
- Clear nocturnal heart-rate trough consistent with consolidated overnight sleep, which physiologically supports restorative sleep.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the objective and self-report evidence, the participant shows more indicators of preserved sleep quality (adequate duration, low nightly variability, consolidated nocturnal physiology, low depressive symptoms/stress) than of severe sleep disturbance. The main countervailing concerns are reduced circadian amplitude, lower interdaily stability, modest intraday fragmentation, a late sleep-wake timing, and weekly alcohol use—features that could raise subjective sleep complaints despite good duration. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a PSQI level at or below the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). In other words, relative to the sample, the participant is likely to report sleep quality near-to-better-than average rather than substantially worse than average.

Suggested focal points if further assessment or intervention were desired: evaluate timing and stability of the sleep–wake schedule (given late median onset and lower interdaily stability), assess evening alcohol timing, and consider behavioral strategies to increase circadian amplitude and daytime structure (regular morning light exposure, consistent wake times, and mild-to-moderate daytime activity), since these could improve subjective sleep consolidation even when duration is already adequate."
96184,"Objective wearable data and self-report together point to a pattern of sleep that is short in duration and highly irregular in timing, both of which are commonly associated with poorer sleep quality. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 5 hours 27 minutes (Z = -2.16 relative to the sample), well below normative recommendations; this short duration is accompanied by extremely high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 359 minutes, Z = 5.88) and highly variable sleep onset timing (median sleep start 04:42, sleep start SD = 422 minutes, Z = 7.44). Circadian-regularity metrics from heart rate also indicate low day-to-day structure: low interdaily stability (0.22, Z = -1.56), low 24-hour autocorrelation (0.11, Z = -1.79), and reduced amplitude (6.21, Z = -1.48). Several of these variability measures (sleep duration SD and sleep start time SD) show positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.21–0.22), reinforcing that the participant’s marked irregularity and late, short sleep are likely contributors to an elevated PSQI (poorer sleep quality).

Physiological heart-rate features provide a mixed but interpretable picture. Aggregate hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected nadir across the early morning hours (large negative deviations between ~2–7 AM), consistent with nocturnal cardiovascular down-regulation; the participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (55.5 bpm, Z = -0.32), which commonly reflects good cardiovascular fitness and is not in itself an indicator of poor sleep. However, the low circadian amplitude and reduced interdaily stability indicate blunted and inconsistent daily heart-rate rhythms despite normal nocturnal dipping when it occurs—this reduced rhythmic robustness is associated in the literature with fragmented or poorly consolidated sleep and is reflected here by a small positive correlation between some early-morning hourly deviations and PSQI (up to r ≈ 0.23).

Self-report and lifestyle measures provide both buffering and risk-relevant context. Protective features include low depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55, classified “not depressed”), high self-esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26), low substance use, healthy BMI (19.1), and generally good academic performance (GPA >3.5). These factors tend to associate with better perceived and objective sleep in many samples. Conversely, the participant reports somewhat elevated perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) and trait anxiety in the mildly elevated range (STAI = 42, Z ≈ 0.07); both measures show modest positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.2–0.49 for related affective scales), suggesting that stress and anxiety may be contributing to sleep difficulty. Low frequency of exercise and limited social/leisure routines also remove potential behavioral supports for regular sleep timing and consolidation.

Weighing the evidence, the balance favors an interpretation of poorer-than-average sleep quality for this participant. The strongest objective indicators of impaired sleep are short median duration, extreme variability in both duration and timing, and reduced circadian regularity (interdaily stability, amplitude, and 24-hour autocorrelation)—all metrics with meaningful z-score departures from the study mean and positive correlations with PSQI. Protective factors (low substance use, low depressive symptoms, low resting heart rate, high self-esteem) reduce the likelihood that medical or mood pathology is the primary driver, but they do not offset the expected negative effects of the pronounced irregularity and restricted sleep opportunity. Relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72, these data suggest the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean (i.e., worse than average)."
79395,"Objective, wearable-derived indicators point toward generally well-structured, physiologically restorative sleep. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 15 minutes (Z = 0.09), and mean daily nap frequency was very low (0.08 naps/day), both of which are consistent with adequate sleep opportunity and limited daytime compensatory sleep. Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a strong and regular rest–activity rhythm: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.55, Z = 1.16) and the autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.46, Z = 1.15), while intradaily variability is below the sample mean (0.47, Z = −0.53), signaling low fragmentation of daily physiological rhythms. The participant’s resting heart rate is low (56.7 bpm, Z = −0.17) and the aggregate hourly heart-rate profile shows a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest deviations from mesor seen between ~2:00–6:00 AM, down to −21.8 bpm at 5–6 AM), which is physiologically consistent with consolidated sleep and nocturnal restoration.

Conversely, several psychological and behavioral signals point toward increased likelihood of poorer subjective sleep quality. Self-report measures reveal elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32, Z = 1.95) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 54, Z = 1.25); both of these scales have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40), making them salient risk factors for higher (worse) PSQI scores. Self-rated happiness and self-esteem are low (happy current = 2.0, Z = −1.61; Rosenberg self-esteem score = 25, Z = −1.85), and those affective factors are also associated with worse subjective sleep in the sample. Although perceived stress is not markedly elevated (PSS Z ≈ −0.44), the combination of high depressive and anxiety symptoms is likely to influence subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings, and daytime functioning—components captured by the PSQI.

Behavioral timing and evening physiological arousal provide mixed evidence. The participant’s sleep timing is consistently late: median sleep start at ~01:21 AM with relatively low night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 47 minutes, Z = −0.80), indicating a stable but late chronotype. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated cardiovascular activity in the late evening (large positive deviations around 9–11 PM, with Z-scores > 1 for 9–11 PM), which could reflect evening arousal or activity that would increase sleep onset latency or subjective sleep disturbance despite preserved total sleep duration. Alcohol use at a frequency of 1–2 times per week is modest and shows little correlation with PSQI in this sample; frequent social exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23) and limited napping are behaviors that would be expected to protect sleep quality.

Weighing the objective and subjective information together yields a nuanced assessment. Objectively, physiological and timing metrics (adequate median duration, low nap use, strong interdaily regularity, nocturnal HR dipping and low resting HR) are consistent with sleep that is at least functionally restorative. Subjectively and psychologically, however, high depressive and anxiety symptom burden along with low positive affect strongly favor worse perceived sleep. Given the moderate-to-strong associations of mood symptoms with PSQI in this sample, the overall profile is most consistent with sleep quality that is near the study population mean but leaning toward worse-than-average subjective sleep. In other words, the participant’s inferred PSQI is likely close to the population mean (6.73) with a modest tendency toward scoring above the mean (worse sleep) because of the pronounced depressive and anxiety symptoms despite generally favorable objective physiology.

Implications: targeted assessment of subjective sleep domains (sleep latency, perceived sleep quality, nocturnal disturbances, and daytime dysfunction) would help resolve the objective–subjective discrepancy. Interventions that address evening arousal (behavioral wind-down, reducing late-evening stimulating activities), and mental health treatment for depression/anxiety would be the most direct avenues to improve PSQI-relevant subjective sleep quality given the current profile."
59863,"Overall summary and comparison to the study sample:
Taken together, the multimodal profile for this participant points to relatively good sleep quality compared with the study sample. The pattern of behavioral, subjective and wearable-derived metrics (regular timing, sufficient median sleep duration, low day-to-day and within-day variability, minimal napping, and favorable mood and trait scores) is more consistent with a PSQI score below the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73). This inference is supported especially by several measures that show stronger expected associations with PSQI (e.g., low depressive symptom score, consistent sleep duration) and by circadian regularity indices that are better than average.

Evidence pointing toward relatively good sleep (factors that would predict a lower PSQI):
- Sleep quantity and regularity: Median wearable-measured sleep duration is 7 h 24 m (Z = 0.27), which is slightly above the sample mean, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD 70 minutes; Z = -0.69). Sleep start times are reasonably consistent (start-time SD Z = -0.21) and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0.0; Z = -0.86). These objective features are generally associated with better subjective sleep quality.  
- Circadian rhythm structure: Interdaily stability (0.46; Z = 0.42) and a low intradaily variability (0.38; Z = -1.16) indicate a relatively stable daily pattern of heart-rate–based activity and fewer abrupt within-day transitions, which tend to be protective for sleep continuity. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is modestly above average (Z = 0.64), consistent with regular daily rhythms.  
- Favorable psychological traits and low symptom burden: The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71). Self-esteem and reported happiness are relatively high (RSES Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64). Because depressive symptoms in this sample show one of the stronger correlations with PSQI (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49), the low CES-D score is a particularly relevant protective factor. Lower perceived stress and high health satisfaction further support better sleep.  
- Healthy behaviors: Regular exercise (frequent alone and group exercise; Zs ≈ 0.5–1.1) and minimal use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs are additional behaviors that typically support sleep quality.

Evidence suggesting potential contributors to worse sleep (factors that would predict a higher PSQI):
- Elevated baseline cardiovascular tone: The heart rate mesor is relatively high (Mesor = 91.26, Z = 2.36) and resting heart rate is above average (67.7 bpm; Z = 1.13). Although the correlations of these cardiac indices with PSQI in the sample are modest (mesor correlation ≈ 0.07; resting HR correlation ≈ 0.13), an elevated mesor/resting HR can reflect greater physiological arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness and can be associated with sleep fragmentation or lower subjective sleep quality in some individuals.  
- Late sleep timing: Median sleep start time is around 00:38 (12:38 AM). Later sleep timing is sometimes associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning, and the dataset shows small positive correlations between sleep start-time variability and PSQI. Although this participant’s timing is fairly consistent, the relatively late average onset could still modestly influence perceived sleep quality for some outcomes.  
- Modest alcohol use: The participant reports beer consumption 1–2 times per week (Z ≈ 1.01). The sample-level correlation between alcohol and PSQI is small here, but alcohol use is a potential, if minor, contributor to sleep disruption in some people.

Synthesis and interpretation:
The preponderance of evidence favors reasonably good sleep quality for this participant relative to the study sample. Key drivers of that conclusion are objective sleep quantity near or above 7 hours, low night-to-night variability and absence of naps, stable circadian heart-rate rhythms, and low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms—especially important because depressive symptoms had a relatively strong positive correlation with PSQI in this sample. Countervailing signals (notably the high heart rate mesor/resting HR and somewhat late sleep timing) are present but have smaller empirical associations with PSQI in the dataset and do not outweigh the multiple protective indicators. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a PSQI below the population mean (i.e., better-than-average sleep quality), while acknowledging that elevated baseline cardiac tone and late timing could modestly raise subjective sleep complaints in some contexts.

Notes on uncertainty and practical implications:
This conclusion is probabilistic rather than diagnostic. The wearable cardiac markers (high mesor and resting HR) merit attention as potential signs of physiological arousal that could influence sleep if they change over time; if the participant reports sleep complaints, evaluation of nighttime awakenings, sources of autonomic activation (caffeine, stress, or fitness-related factors), and timing of activities could clarify contributors. Overall, however, the combined subjective and objective indicators in this dataset align with sleep quality that is near or below (better than) the study-sample mean PSQI."
22913,"Summary: The multimodal data indicate a mixed but overall favorable sleep profile. Objective wearable measures show long, relatively regular nocturnal sleep (median duration 8 h 37 min; Z = +1.79) with low fragmentation of circadian heart-rate patterns (intradaily variability = 0.29; Z = −1.8) and only modest day-to-day variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 83 minutes; Z ≈ 0). Self-report screening instruments show minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0; Z = −1.38) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 34; Z = −0.72), both of which in the study sample are among the stronger correlates of PSQI (CES-D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40). Taken together these features weigh toward relatively good subjective and physiological sleep quality.

Features that could indicate higher PSQI (poorer sleep): Several behavioral and physiological indicators are associated with increased risk of poorer sleep in the study context. The participant’s BMI is elevated (28.7), and physical activity frequencies are low (exercise 1–2×/month; sports “not at all”), both of which are commonly linked to reduced sleep quality; while correlations in this sample are modest, they remain potential contributors. Average mesor (mean HR) is relatively high (87.2 bpm; Z = +1.81) and resting heart rate is somewhat above the study mean (64.6 bpm; Z = +0.77); higher resting/mean cardiac tone can reflect greater basal arousal and had small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (mesor r ≈ 0.07, RHR r ≈ 0.12). Alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week; Z ≈ +1) could also modestly affect sleep continuity for some individuals. Finally, self-reported happiness is below average (Z ≈ −0.53), and lower positive affect can be associated with poorer sleep; these psychosocial and lifestyle factors would tend to push PSQI in the less favorable direction if they influence sleep continuity or sleep-related distress.

Features that could indicate lower PSQI (better sleep): Objective sleep duration is substantially longer than the study mean (median 8 h 37 min; Z = +1.79) and nap frequency is low (mean daily naps = 0.12; Z = +0.61), which together suggest sufficient nocturnal sleep opportunity without reliance on naps. Circadian heart-rate structure shows low intradaily variability (Z = −1.8) and average interdaily stability (0.41; Z ≈ 0), indicating stable, consolidated day–night organization of physiology—patterns generally associated with better sleep quality. Nocturnal hourly heart-rate deviations show the typical robust nighttime decline (~−15 to −17 bpm across the 1–7 AM window), consistent with preserved nocturnal autonomic down-regulation. Low depressive and anxiety symptom scores (CES-D and STAI both well below the sample mean) are notable protective factors, given their strong positive correlations with PSQI in the cohort. Sleep timing (median start ≈ 23:55) is within a typical late-evening range and sleep timing variability is not elevated, which also favors better subjective continuity.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s profile contains several strong indicators of good sleep (long median sleep duration, low intradaily variability, preserved nocturnal heart-rate decline, and minimal depressive/anxiety symptoms) alongside some modest risk factors (elevated BMI, low exercise, mildly elevated mesor/resting HR, and weekly alcohol use). On balance, these data most consistently point to sleep quality that is better than the study sample average. Therefore, relative to the population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s inferred overall sleep quality is likely below the population mean (i.e., better-than-average sleep quality).

Caveats: This inference integrates cross-sectional and aggregated wearable summaries with single-time self-report measures; PSQI itself was not provided here and subjective sleep quality can diverge from wearable indices. Some risk factors (BMI, low activity, alcohol) may exert effects over longer timeframes or interact with other unmeasured variables. If clinical or research decisions depend on precise PSQI classification, direct PSQI measurement or longitudinal follow-up is recommended."
48969,"Indicators consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality are prominent in the self-report data and are supported by several wearable-derived physiological signals. The participant reports markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 42; Z = 2.99), and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 59; Z = 1.75); both of these measures show sizable positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r = 0.48; STAI r = 0.39), making them strong predictors of a higher PSQI (worse subjective sleep). Low self-esteem (RSES = 22; Z = −2.28, correlation with PSQI r = −0.34) and low momentary happiness (Z = −1.61) further align with the same pattern. Behavioral habits that commonly degrade sleep—extensive evening/late-media exposure and sedentary recreation—are extreme for this participant (watching TV/videos, gaming, and internet use >4 hours/day; Z-scores 3.17, 4.74, 2.19 respectively), and these activities are associated in the sample with small-to-moderate increases in PSQI. Elevated average physiological arousal also favors poorer sleep: resting heart rate is relatively high (68.6 bpm; Z = 1.24) and MESOR is elevated (79.8; Z = 0.79), characteristics that, in this sample, trend with worse PSQI (small positive correlations). Finally, sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 116 minutes; Z = 0.33) and the modest positive correlation of that variability with PSQI (r = 0.20) suggest that fluctuation in nightly sleep is another contributor to subjective sleep problems.

At the same time, several objective and behavioral markers point toward aspects of relatively preserved or good sleep. Median nightly sleep duration from the wearable is approximately 7 hours 51 minutes (Z = 0.84), which is longer than average in the sample and broadly consistent with normative sleep duration; mean daily naps are essentially absent (0.0; Z = −0.86), reducing fragmentation of nighttime sleep. The median sleep start time (≈00:06) is moderately late but not extremely variable (start-time SD ≈ 83 minutes; Z ≈ −0.01), indicating a reasonably consolidated nightly schedule. Circadian-structure metrics are mixed but include evidence of regularity: 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively high (0.44; Z = 0.98), and interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.40; Z = −0.08), both suggesting a recurring daily rhythm. The hourly aggregate heart-rate profile shows the expected nocturnal reductions (largest negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevations peaking in the late afternoon/early evening (acrophase ~5:06 PM), consistent with a present—but somewhat blunted—circadian amplitude (amplitude = 9.62; Z = −0.38). Regular timing, adequate total duration, limited napping, and an overall preserved nocturnal heart-rate decline are all factors that tend to predict lower PSQI scores (better sleep).

Integrating these modalities, the most salient tension is between robust subjective symptom burden (high depressive/anxiety scores and low self-esteem, with strong correlations to PSQI) and objectively sufficient sleep duration with a generally regular 24‑hour rhythm. Physiological signals complicate the picture: resting heart rate and MESOR are higher than the sample mean and circadian amplitude is reduced, a pattern often associated with elevated arousal/stress and poorer sleep quality despite adequate minutes of sleep. The participant’s heavy evening screen use and sedentary recreational profile are notable behavioral risk factors that plausibly degrade sleep continuity or subjective sleep quality even when total duration appears adequate.

Taking all evidence together, the balance of risk factors (particularly the very large depressive symptom score and substantial evening media use, both of which are among the strongest correlates of PSQI in the sample) suggests this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely worse than average in the study sample. Stated relative to the sample PSQI distribution (mean = 6.71, SD = 2.14), the data indicate a PSQI level above the population mean (i.e., a higher/worse PSQI score than the study average), despite objective signs of sufficient sleep duration. This inference relies on the strong links between mood/anxiety symptoms and PSQI in the sample and is tempered by the objective markers of regular timing and adequate total sleep time."
79731,"Psychological and behavioral context: The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 27, Z = +1.42) and trait anxiety (STAI = 60, Z = +1.85). These affective scores have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating that higher symptom burden in this participant is a risk factor for worse subjective sleep quality. Self‑esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, Z = −1.29), and global satisfaction with physical health is low (Z ≈ −1.53); both have modest associations with sleep in the sample. Reported substance use is infrequent (alcohol ~1–2×/month; no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use), and reported daily stress is only modestly elevated (PSS score Z ≈ +0.38). Overall, the self‑report pattern shows affective vulnerability (notably depressive and anxiety symptoms) that is commonly linked to impaired sleep quality.

Wearable circadian and cardiac indicators: Heart‑rate–derived circadian metrics show reduced rhythm robustness and greater fragmentation. Interdaily stability is below the sample mean (0.34, Z ≈ −0.57), intradaily variability is elevated (0.64, Z ≈ +0.67), and amplitude is lower than typical (amplitude = 7.09, Z ≈ −1.19). Resting heart rate is relatively high (71.2 bpm, Z ≈ +1.55), and mesor is elevated (79.9, Z ≈ +0.81). Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal dip (large negative deviations from mesor between ~2:00–8:00 AM), but against a raised baseline mesor/resting HR. Taken together, these features indicate an overall circadian pattern that is present but attenuated and somewhat fragmented, with higher-than-typical cardiovascular activation at baseline.

Objective sleep timing and variability: Wearable sleep estimates indicate a late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:58 AM) and a relatively long median nightly duration (8 h 17 m; Z ≈ +1.37). However, night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration is high (SD ≈ 177 minutes, Z ≈ +1.73), and mean daily naps are above the sample median (0.19 naps/day, Z ≈ +1.34). Sleep start time variability is not especially large (SD ≈ 53 minutes, Z ≈ −0.66), which suggests the participant repeatedly adopts a late sleep schedule rather than highly irregular sleep‑onset timing. The combination of late, prolonged sleep episodes with large variability and frequent short naps is consistent with a pattern of compensatory sleep and circadian misalignment rather than stable, restorative nocturnal sleep.

Evidence pointing toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several convergent indicators suggest the participant is likely to score higher (worse) on PSQI. Elevated depression and trait anxiety—both strongly correlated with PSQI in the sample—are key risk factors. Wearable markers of circadian disruption (reduced interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, and low amplitude) and an elevated resting heart rate (Z ≈ +1.55) point toward physiological arousal and fragmented daily structure, both associated with poorer sleep quality. High night‑to‑night variability in total sleep time (Z ≈ +1.73) and the presence of daytime napping (Z ≈ +1.34) also commonly accompany subjective reports of poor sleep. Finally, the very late median sleep onset (~03:00) can reflect circadian misalignment with normative schedules and relates to difficulty initiating sleep or daytime impairment.

Evidence pointing toward better sleep quality (lower PSQI): There are also features that could moderate the expected PSQI elevation. Median total sleep duration is relatively long (≈8 h 17 m, Z ≈ +1.37), which can reduce certain PSQI component scores related to sleep duration. Nightly heart‑rate deviations show a substantial nocturnal dip, which may reflect consolidated periods of low physiological activation during the sleep interval. Low substance use and only modest perceived stress reduce some common contributors to poor sleep. Additionally, sleep onset variability is not markedly elevated, suggesting the participant maintains a consistent (though late) sleep schedule rather than highly erratic bedtimes.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the profile is more consistent with impaired subjective sleep quality than with robust sleep. High affective symptom burden (depression and anxiety), attenuated and more fragmented circadian cardiac rhythms, elevated resting heart rate, large night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration, and compensatory daytime napping weigh strongly toward a higher PSQI score. Although median sleep duration is long and nocturnal heart‑rate dips indicate consolidated low‑activity periods, these positives are likely insufficient to offset the multiple risk indicators. Relative to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.71), the participant’s multimodal profile suggests a PSQI level above the population mean (i.e., poorer-than‑average sleep quality)."
64296,"Indicators consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality
The participant’s habitual sleep timing is notably late: the median sleep start time is 01:07 AM, which is later than typical student timing and can contribute to shorter effective sleep opportunity and circadian misalignment. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 52 minutes (Z = -0.40), i.e., slightly below the study sample mean, which may increase risk for poorer subjective sleep. Although sleep duration variability is low, the late timing of sleep onset combined with modestly shortened duration are both plausible contributors to a higher PSQI. Behavioral factors that could modestly disadvantage sleep include very low solo exercise (exercised alone: “not at all,” Z = -1.93) and a modestly sedentary pattern (sedentary hobby Z = 0.82). Several of the hourly heart-rate deviations during the early night (e.g., 1–4 AM) show small positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (correlations up to ~0.22), indicating that some nocturnal physiological patterns captured here have previously been associated with worse self-reported sleep; although these correlations are small, they support attention to late-night physiology in interpreting sleep complaints.

Indicators consistent with relatively better sleep quality
Multiple objective and self-report features point toward relatively good sleep regulation and lower likelihood of severe sleep disturbance. Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a regular and robust 24-hour rhythm: interdaily stability is elevated (0.58, Z = 1.41), autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (0.48, Z = 1.32), and amplitude is markedly high (19.12, Z = 2.70). Intradaily variability is not elevated (0.51, Z = -0.25), suggesting low fragmentation of heart-rate–based activity across the day. Nighttime heart rate shows a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations around 3–5 AM), and resting heart rate is relatively low (49.8 bpm, Z = -0.99), both of which are physiologic indicators commonly associated with higher cardiovascular fitness and more consolidated nocturnal physiology. The participant reports minimal depressive or anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07; STAI = 35, Z = -0.62), low perceived stress (PSS = 18, Z = -0.98), high self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64) and higher self-esteem (Z = 0.96), all of which are psychosocial factors that, in this sample, correlate with better sleep. Additional protective behaviors include no reported alcohol or drug use and essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), which support stable night sleep.

Integrated interpretation and comparison with the study population mean PSQI
Taken together, the profile is mixed but leans toward reasonably preserved sleep regulation. Objective circadian regularity (high interdaily stability, high autocorrelation, and high amplitude), low intradaily fragmentation, low night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 42 minutes, Z = -1.33), absence of naps, low resting heart rate, and favorable psychosocial scores argue for relatively good sleep continuity and resilience against severe sleep problems. Countervailing features—primarily a late habitual sleep onset (~1:07 AM) and slightly shorter-than-average nightly duration—are risk factors for worse subjective sleep but, in this case, are modest in magnitude.

Relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile suggests overall sleep quality near the population mean, with a slight tendency toward better-than-average sleep rather than markedly worse. In other words, the data are most consistent with a PSQI score close to the sample median rather than substantially above it; however, the late sleep timing and modestly short sleep duration are features to monitor because they could push subjective sleep quality higher under increased stress or reduced recovery."
17569,"Summary of indicators consistent with poorer sleep quality
The wearable and survey data contain several convergent signals that typically predict higher PSQI scores (poorer sleep). Most notably, the participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 44 minutes (Z = -1.81), well below typical recommendations; short sleep duration is a major driver of global sleep-quality scores. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈01:11 AM), which can shorten sleep opportunity and is often associated with subjective sleep complaints. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65), a factor that correlates positively with PSQI in the study sample (r ≈ 0.20) and can increase nocturnal arousal and sleep fragmentation. Although alcohol use is moderate (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.01) and shows a small correlation with PSQI in the sample, it may still contribute to sleep consolidation problems on occasion. Finally, the intra-individual variability in sleep duration (SD = 64 minutes) and the modest positive correlation of that variability with PSQI (r ≈ 0.20) suggest some nights of poorer sleep, which would raise overall PSQI score.

Summary of indicators consistent with better sleep quality
Several physiological and behavioral features point in the opposite direction and are commonly associated with lower PSQI scores (better sleep). Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a relatively regular and robust rhythm: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.55, Z = 1.16), amplitude is elevated (Z = 0.91), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is positive, all of which are generally protective against sleep fragmentation and daytime dysfunction. Resting heart rate is low (47 bpm, Z = -1.33), which is consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and may be associated with more consolidated nocturnal physiology. The participant shows a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dip in the 2:00–6:00 AM window (hourly deviations −25 to −32 bpm relative to mesor), consistent with physiologic sleep. Behaviorally, the participant reports no daily naps, relatively consistent sleep-start timing (SD ≈ 32 minutes, Z = -1.12), limited daily screen/internet time, low depressive (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and anxiety trait scores (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33), and relatively high health satisfaction (Z ≈ 1.13)—all features that tend to protect against high PSQI scores.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Weighing the evidence, the strongest single negative signal is the short median sleep duration (5 h 44 m; Z = -1.81), coupled with a late habitual sleep onset—both of which directly reduce sleep opportunity and tend to increase global PSQI. Protective features (robust circadian stability and amplitude, low resting heart rate, limited naps, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, and consistent bedtimes) mitigate some expected consequences of short sleep, and they suggest physiological consolidation of the sleep that does occur. On balance, however, the magnitude of the short sleep duration and late sleep timing are likely to produce a net increase in PSQI relative to the average study participant. Therefore, based on the available multimodal evidence, this participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being above the population mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average) rather than near or below it—while acknowledging uncertainty because an actual PSQI score is not provided here.

Caveats and interpretation confidence
This conclusion integrates wearable-derived physiology, objective sleep timing/duration, and self-report trait/lifestyle measures, but it is limited by the absence of the participant’s direct PSQI self-report in the data provided. Correlations shown between individual metrics and PSQI in the sample are modest and do not imply causation; some protective and risk indicators offset each other. The inference that sleep quality is likely above the population mean should therefore be treated as a probabilistic judgment grounded primarily in objectively short sleep duration and late sleep onset, moderated by robust circadian physiology and favorable mental-health traits."
77036,"Summary of key patterns (wearable physiology and sleep behavior):
The wearable-derived circadian profile shows a well-structured, robust daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.53, Z = +1.00) and 24-hour autocorrelation is strongly elevated (0.62, Z = +2.49), while intradaily variability is low (0.36, Z = -1.31). Together these indicate consistent day-to-day timing of physiological activity and relatively little fragmentation of activity within days. Nighttime heart rate exhibits a clear nocturnal decline (largest aggregate deviations from mesor between roughly 2:00–5:00 AM, reaching -20 bpm at peak), and resting heart rate is in the mid-range for the sample (61.2 bpm, Z = +0.36). Sleep timing and duration are also relatively regular: median sleep start ≈ 00:47 and median sleep duration ≈ 6 h 51 m (Z = -0.41), with modest night-to-night variability in both duration (SD 67 min, Z = -0.77) and start time (SD 58 min, Z = -0.55). Napping is essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86).

Evidence consistent with relatively lower PSQI (better sleep quality):
Several objective circadian and sleep-stability indicators point toward relatively good sleep consolidation. High interdaily stability and very strong 24-hour autocorrelation indicate consistent timing of the sleep–wake cycle across days, and low intradaily variability suggests limited within-day fragmentation of activity—both features that are typically associated with lower PSQI scores. Low night-to-night variability in sleep duration and start time, minimal napping, and a clearly expressed nocturnal heart-rate nadir further support the presence of consolidated nocturnal rest. The participant’s median sleep duration (~6 h 51 m) is near the common recommendation threshold and not markedly short; combined with stable timing, this pattern is more consistent with PSQI values at or below the study mean than with markedly poor sleep.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality):
There are behavioral and self-report features that could push toward higher PSQI. The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 43, Z = +0.17, labeled “anxious”) and moderate perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = +0.38); both measures correlate positively with PSQI in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.40; CES-D r ≈ 0.49 for depressive symptoms). Sleep start is relatively late (median ~00:47), which can contribute to perceived sleep problems even when duration is near 7 hours. Health satisfaction is below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.53) and exercise frequency is low compared with peers; lower physical activity can be associated with poorer subjective sleep. Although many hourly heart-rate deviations and circadian parameters are consistent with consolidated sleep, some small positive correlations between nocturnal heart-rate dips and PSQI (e.g., early-morning hourly deviations with r up to ~0.23) indicate that aspects of the physiological pattern relate modestly to worse subjective sleep in the broader sample—these correlations are small and should be interpreted cautiously, but they temper conclusions about uniformly good sleep.

Integrated interpretation and relative comparison to the study sample:
Balancing objective wearable indices and self-report, the dominant signal is one of circadian regularity and consolidated nocturnal physiology (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, low sleep timing variability, no naps), which are characteristics that tend to predict lower (better) PSQI scores. Countervailing influences—late sleep timing, elevated trait anxiety and modestly elevated perceived stress, and lower self-rated health/exercise—introduce risk for worse subjective sleep and could push PSQI upward. Considering the magnitude and direction of these features overall, the participant’s sleep profile is most consistent with overall sleep quality at or somewhat better than the study population mean. In the study’s statistical context (population PSQI mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the available evidence supports an inference that the participant’s PSQI is likely near to slightly below the population mean (i.e., comparable to or modestly better than average sleep quality), rather than substantially worse.

Clinical and measurement notes (caveats):
- Objective circadian regularity and low fragmentation are strong protective markers for subjective sleep quality, but elevated anxiety/stress often manifest in subjective complaints that may not be fully captured by wearable metrics.  
- Correlations reported in the dataset are sample-level associations and generally small-to-moderate; they should be used to guide interpretation rather than to deterministically predict an individual’s PSQI.  
- If a more definitive assessment of subjective sleep problems is required, a direct PSQI score or additional sleep-specific self-report (e.g., sleep disturbances, sleep latency, daytime dysfunction items) would reduce uncertainty."
82986,"Summary and overall comparison to the sample
The wearable and survey data together indicate a mixed profile in which objective sleep timing and duration are the strongest indicators of poor sleep quality, while self-reported psychological well-being and low substance use are protective. On balance, the objective metrics (very short median nightly sleep of 5 hours 6 minutes, late median sleep onset at ~02:24, and signs of reduced circadian amplitude and regularity) lead to the inference that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely worse than the study sample average. Using the provided sample PSQI mean of 6.73 (SD 2.16), the pattern of objectively short, late, and somewhat irregular sleep would most plausibly correspond to a PSQI score above the population mean.

Evidence indicating relatively poorer sleep quality (factors that would raise PSQI)
- Short total sleep time: Median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 6 minutes (Z = -2.60 relative to the study population), a markedly shorter duration than typical in this sample. Short sleep duration is a primary driver of poorer PSQI scores (sleep duration contributes directly to PSQI subscales).
- Late sleep timing and potential sleep restriction: Median sleep start time around 02:24 AM indicates a substantially delayed sleep schedule, which often reduces total opportunity for night sleep and can produce greater sleep latency, daytime dysfunction, and decreased sleep efficiency—features that increase PSQI.
- Dampened circadian rhythm amplitude and reduced stability: Circadian amplitude (7.55, Z = -1.04) and interdaily stability (0.33, Z = -0.66) are below the population mean, while intradaily variability is moderately elevated (0.61, Z = 0.46). This combination indicates a flattened and less-regular heart rate circadian rhythm, consistent with weaker day–night physiological differentiation and greater fragmentation of daily rhythms, which are associated with worse sleep quality.
- Elevated resting heart rate and modest nocturnal arousal markers: Resting heart rate is 66.8 bpm (Z = 1.03). Although hourly heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal declines, some early-morning hours (e.g., 4–6 AM) show relatively less extreme reductions (Z-values around 0.18–0.42), which can reflect residual physiological arousal during the sleep period. Elevated resting HR and blunted nighttime reductions have small positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset and are consistent with more disturbed sleep physiology.
- Variability in nightly sleep duration and timing: Sleep-duration SD ~68 minutes and sleep-start SD ~61 minutes (Z-scores slightly below the mean but not negligible) indicate day-to-day variation that can undermine sleep consolidation and sleep quality.

Evidence indicating relatively better sleep quality (factors that would lower PSQI)
- Low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 4 (Z = -0.97) and trait STAI = 25 (Z = -1.61) are both well below the sample mean. Given that depressive and anxiety symptoms positively correlate with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), these low symptom levels are protective against poor subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction.
- Positive psychosocial and health-related self-reports: High self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66), higher happiness (Z = 1.64), higher interpersonal trust (Z = 1.79), and favorable health satisfaction (Z = 0.80) are all associated with lower PSQI correlations in the sample. These resources can reduce perceived sleep-related impairment and may buffer negative impacts of short sleep on daytime functioning.
- Low substance use and minimal napping: The participant reports no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use and essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Low substance use and limited daytime napping reduce several common contributors to poor sleep consolidation and are thus favorable for sleep quality.
- No strong evidence of extreme sleep fragmentation from wearables: While total sleep time is short, the mean nocturnal heart-rate profile shows substantive nocturnal decline consistent with consolidated sleep for many hours (hourly deviations are negative from midnight through ~6–7 AM), which could indicate relatively continuous sleep episodes during the shortened sleep window rather than highly fragmented sleep.

Physiological circadian and heart-rate context
The cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics indicate a circadian system that is present but blunted and somewhat irregular: higher-than-average MESOR (79.7, Z = 0.79) with lower amplitude (Z = -1.04) and reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.66). This profile suggests the participant’s average cardiovascular tone is somewhat elevated across the day, but the day–night oscillation is reduced. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations are consistent with a typical nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations 2–6 AM) and a robust daytime rise starting around 7–10 AM (positive deviations, Z up to ~1.5), so the broad pattern of sleep–wake physiology is intact; however, the smaller amplitude and reduced day-to-day stability point to dampened circadian signaling that commonly accompanies irregular and late-timed sleep and can worsen subjective and objective sleep quality over time.

Holistic integration and likely PSQI implication
Integrating objective wearable metrics with self-report measures, the strongest signals are objectively short median sleep duration (5 h 6 m) and delayed sleep timing (median start ~02:24), both of which are large-magnitude indicators of poorer sleep and would tend to elevate PSQI above the sample mean. Circadian metrics (reduced amplitude and stability, modestly elevated intradaily variability) and a higher resting heart rate further support likelihood of impaired sleep physiology. Conversely, low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, high positive psychosocial resources, low substance use, and absence of napping are protective and may reduce subjective sleep complaints and daytime dysfunction. Taken together, these data point to an overall sleep quality that is likely above the sample mean PSQI (i.e., worse sleep than average in this study). The objective markers suggest a clinically meaningful reduction in total sleep opportunity and circadian robustness that would be expected to produce a higher PSQI score even if subjective complaints are partly buffered by positive mood and low psychopathology."
11402,"Summary of features consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality:
The wearable and self-report data converge on several signals that commonly accompany higher PSQI scores. Objectively, median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 19 minutes (Z = -1.07), indicating shorter-than-average sleep; sleep timing was markedly delayed with a median sleep start at ~03:17 AM and substantial night-to-night variability in start time (SD = 135 minutes, Z = 1.14). Greater variability in sleep timing and duration has a modest positive correlation with PSQI in this dataset (sleep-start SD r ≈ 0.19; duration SD r ≈ 0.20), suggesting these irregular patterns likely contribute to worse subjective sleep. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z = 0.38) and trait anxiety (STAI = 54, Z = 1.25); these affective measures have relatively strong positive correlations with PSQI here (CES-D r ≈ 0.50, STAI r ≈ 0.40) and therefore represent important contributors to poorer sleep quality. Behavioral factors that can impair sleep—frequent evening/late-night recreational screen time (video games: Z = 2.47; TV/videos: Z = 1.28) and only modest exercise frequency (≈1–2×/week)—also align with a profile that tends toward higher PSQI scores. Physiologically, the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated cardiac activity in late-night hours (positive deviations around 12–2 AM), which could reflect later arousal/active state into the night; resting heart rate is mildly elevated (63.4 bpm, Z = 0.62), both of which are consistent with increased physiological arousal that often accompanies poor sleep.

Features consistent with relatively better sleep quality or mitigating factors:
A few measures point away from severe sleep disturbance. Intradaily variability (a nonparametric measure of fragmentation) is low (0.34, Z = -1.45), which typically indicates fewer rapid transitions between activity states within the day and can be protective against fragmented sleep; this metric, however, shows essentially no correlation with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.0). Circadian summary measures show a clear daily rhythm in heart rate (MESOR 83.48, Z = 1.30; amplitude 12.02, Z = 0.40; acrophase ≈ 6:58 PM), indicating intact day–night structure in heart-rate-based rhythms. Self-report resources that are associated with better sleep—high self-esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and relatively high interpersonal trust (Z = 1.15)—have negative correlations with PSQI in the study (self-esteem r ≈ -0.35; trust r ≈ -0.21) and thus may buffer some sleep-related difficulties. Alcohol and drug use are not high (beer ~1–2×/week; no recreational/non-prescribed drug use), which limits substance-related disruption of sleep. Nap frequency is low (mean daily naps 0.18, Z = 1.21) and, while modestly positively correlated with PSQI here (r ≈ 0.18), it is not a dominant factor relative to timing and affective symptoms.

Physiological rhythm and variability interpretation:
Overall circadian structure is present but attenuated in stability metrics: interdaily stability (0.37, Z = -0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.20, Z = -1.03) are below the study mean, implying day-to-day schedule inconsistency despite a preserved within-day amplitude and acrophase. The pattern of higher-than-mesor heart rate in the late-evening window (12–2 AM) followed by progressively lower-than-mesor values overnight to morning is consistent with delayed and compressed nighttime rest periods; this aligns with the very late sleep onset time and shorter median sleep duration. These aggregated heart-rate features have modest correlations with PSQI (some late-night deviations show small positive correlations), so they plausibly reflect physiological contributors to subjective sleep problems.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population:
Balancing the evidence, the participant exhibits several substantive risk factors for poorer sleep—late and irregular sleep timing, short median sleep duration, elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (which are strongly correlated with PSQI in this sample), late-night physiological arousal, and extensive evening screen use—that together point toward a PSQI score above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73). Mitigating elements (intact within-day circadian amplitude, low intradaily fragmentation, relatively high self-esteem and interpersonal trust, and limited substance misuse) may reduce the severity of sleep complaints but are unlikely to fully offset the impact of the late schedule and affective symptoms. In summary: the multimodal profile is most consistent with sleep quality that is above the population mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average) in this study sample, with timing irregularity and mood/anxiety features as the leading contributing factors."
38610,"Summary of objective sleep timing and quantity: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration of 5 hours 46 minutes (Z = -1.76 versus the study sample), with a median sleep-start time near 02:39 AM and a sleep-start SD of ~54 minutes (Z = -0.63). These values indicate substantially shorter-than-average sleep and a consistently late sleep schedule across the recording period. Napping was minimal (mean daily naps 0.07), so short nocturnal sleep is not substantially compensated by daytime sleep.

Physiological circadian and arousal profile: Heart-rate cosinor results show a relatively high mesor (82.3 bpm; Z = 1.14) and elevated resting heart rate (67.7 bpm; Z = 1.14) paired with a low circadian amplitude (7.23; Z = -1.15). Non‑parametric circadian features indicate modestly reduced interdaily stability (0.37; Z = -0.33) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (0.59; Z = 0.32). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor reveal pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate declines (nadir across ~2–7 AM of roughly -8 to -17 bpm) and a notable evening/late-night elevation around 10–11 PM (+10–12 bpm). Together these findings suggest preserved nocturnal declines in heart rate but a blunted overall daily amplitude and somewhat less consistent day-to-day rhythm, and an evening physiological activation window that temporally precedes the participant’s late sleep onset.

Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality (factors that would elevate PSQI): Short median sleep duration (≈5 h 46 m; Z = -1.76) and a habitual late sleep onset (~02:39 AM) are strong indicators associated with worse subjective sleep quality in this sample. The low circadian amplitude (Z = -1.15) and reduced interdaily regularity (Z ≈ -0.33), together with slightly higher intradaily variability (Z ≈ 0.32), point to circadian blunting and within-day fragmentation—features that correlate with higher PSQI in population analyses. Elevated resting heart rate and the evening HR elevation (10–11 PM) are additional physiological signs that could reflect increased evening arousal or autonomic activation prior to sleep, which can impair sleep initiation and continuity. Sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 90 minutes) and the late timing of sleep further support risk for poorer sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with better sleep quality (factors that would lower PSQI): Several self-report trait and lifestyle measures are protective relative to the study population. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 3, Z = -1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31), both of which are associated with better sleep. Self‑esteem and health-satisfaction scores are relatively high (SelfEsteem Z = 1.66; Health Satisfaction Z = 1.13), and substance use is minimal. Physical activity—in particular exercising with others (Z = 1.23)—is above average and tends to be associated with better sleep outcomes. Minimal napping also reduces potential contributors to fragmented nocturnal sleep. These psychosocial and behavioral strengths would be expected to partially mitigate sleep disturbance.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to sample mean PSQI: Balancing the objective wearable markers and the self-report profile, the pattern is mixed but leans toward poorer sleep quality overall. The most salient drivers are objectively short nocturnal sleep and late timing (both large deviations from the sample mean), together with a blunted circadian amplitude and signs of evening physiological activation. Protective psychological factors (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem, active social exercise) reduce the likelihood of very severe subjective sleep complaints, but they are unlikely to fully offset the impact of chronically short, late sleep. On balance, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is likely above the study population mean PSQI of 6.72 (i.e., worse than the sample average), rather than near or below the mean. This inference emphasizes objective short sleep and timing as primary contributors; it should be interpreted as probabilistic and would be strengthened by contemporaneous PSQI questionnaire data or further context about academic/stress periods."
96610,"Indicators that would tend to push the participant’s Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score upward (i.e., toward poorer sleep quality) are primarily behavioral/timing features. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (01:21 AM), which is a circadian/timing pattern that commonly co-occurs with shorter nocturnal opportunity and with PSQI components related to sleep timing or perceived sleep disturbance; the sleep start time shows modest variability across nights (SD = 48 minutes, Z = -0.77) but the late clock time itself increases risk for sleep restriction relative to an earlier schedule. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 53 minutes (Z = -0.37), which is slightly below the typical 7–8 hour recommendation and could contribute to higher PSQI component scores for sleep duration or daytime dysfunction in some participants. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is nontrivial (SD = 96 minutes), and this metric correlates positively with PSQI in the study sample (correlation ~0.20), suggesting that intra-individual inconsistency in sleep length is a relevant adverse factor for this participant. Although naps are infrequent (mean daily naps = 0.11), the combination of late bedtimes and sub-7-hour median sleep opportunity is the clearest set of behavioral signals that could elevate a PSQI score.

By contrast, multiple psychological and physiological indicators point toward relatively good sleep-related functioning and therefore would tend to push the participant’s PSQI score downward (i.e., toward better sleep quality). Self-report measures show low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 2.0, Z = -1.18) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 25, Z = -1.61), high self-esteem (Rosenberg Z = 1.66), and relatively high current happiness and health satisfaction (happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 2.05). Low substance use (no reported alcohol or recreational drug use) and minimal evening screen/sedentary hobby engagement (internet usage 16–30 minutes, little TV/gaming/reading) are lifestyle patterns associated with better sleep hygiene in many samples. These psychosocial features are accompanied by a low resting heart rate (60.8 bpm, Z = 0.32) and minimal nap behavior, both consistent with general physiological recovery and not suggestive of excessive daytime sleepiness that would inflate PSQI daytime dysfunction scores.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features further support a relatively stable, robust rhythm that is typically associated with better sleep quality. Interdaily stability is moderately high (0.51, Z = 0.83) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (0.41, Z = 0.73), both indicating consistent day-to-day structure in heart-rate activity. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is elevated (amplitude = 13.98, Z = 1.03) and the MESOR is slightly above the study mean (80.72, Z = 0.92); higher amplitude and good interdaily stability are generally linked to better consolidated sleep and lower PSQI in population studies (amplitude shows a modest negative correlation with PSQI in this dataset, ~-0.11). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected strong nocturnal trough (large negative deviations between ~1–6 AM) and daytime elevations in the afternoon, consistent with intact circadian modulation of autonomic tone rather than fragmented nocturnal physiology. Intradaily variability is near the population mean (0.51, Z = -0.25), indicating no marked fragmentation of the 24-hour heart-rate pattern.

Balancing the evidence: the strongest sleep-disrupting signal in this multimodal profile is the late sleep timing and the slightly suboptimal median sleep duration; these factors could modestly increase subjective or objective measures of sleep problems captured by PSQI. Against that, the participant shows a constellation of favorable psychological, behavioral, and physiological markers—low mood/anxiety, low substance use, robust circadian rhythmicity, low resting heart rate, infrequent napping and reasonable night-to-night stability of bedtimes—that are each associated with lower PSQI scores. Effect sizes and correlations in the available dataset are generally small to moderate, so no single metric overwhelmingly outweighs the others.

Holistic conclusion with comparison to the study sample mean PSQI: taking all available data into account, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being at or slightly better than the study population average—that is, below the population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.72). The late bedtime and slightly short median sleep duration suggest a modest, targetable risk for poorer sleep, but the participant’s favorable psychosocial profile and relatively strong circadian organization make it more likely that their global PSQI would be near to slightly below the sample mean rather than markedly above it. Uncertainty remains (particularly because PSQI itself is not provided for this individual), so these inferences should be interpreted as probabilistic and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive."
77711,"Summary of objective sleep physiology and timing: Wearable-derived data indicate a generally consolidated nocturnal rest period with clear diurnal cardiac modulation. The participant’s median sleep duration was about 6 hours 55 minutes (slightly below the study mean; Z = -0.33) with low night-to-night variability in duration (SD ~70 minutes, Z = -0.70) and relatively consistent sleep onset times (median start 01:02:30, start-time SD 55 minutes, Z = -0.62). Heart-rate cosinor features show a lowered mesor (68.8 bpm, Z = -0.70) and a pronounced nighttime reduction in hourly mean heart rate (largest deviations ~-16 to -20 bpm between ~1:00–6:00 AM), and an acrophase in the mid-afternoon (≈3:28 PM). Circadian regularity measures are mixed: interdaily stability is below the cohort mean (0.34, Z = -0.57), intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (0.51, Z = -0.25), and 24-hour autocorrelation is modest (0.34, Z = 0.14). The participant reports essentially no daytime napping.

Factors that point toward higher PSQI scores (poorer sleep quality): Several psychosocial and behavioral features are associated with risk for worse subjective sleep. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 52, Z = +1.06), and this measure shows a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.40), suggesting anxiety-proneness that can worsen perceived sleep quality. Self-esteem is low (RSES = 28, Z = -1.43), and lower self-esteem in this sample correlates with worse PSQI (r ≈ -0.35 for self-esteem → PSQI), which may reflect vulnerability to negative sleep appraisal or rumination. The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep onset ~1:02 AM), and evening/leisure behaviors (substantial listening to music, 3–4 hours/day; elevated TV/video time) are higher than average and have small positive correlations with PSQI. Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm is below average (Z = -0.57), indicating somewhat weaker day-to-day regularity of circadian timing, a pattern that is generally associated with poorer sleep in population studies. Taken together, these factors (late timing, higher trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, less regular circadian pattern) point toward mechanisms that could increase subjective sleep disturbance and elevate PSQI.

Factors that point toward lower PSQI scores (better sleep quality): Several objective and self-report indicators are consistent with relatively preserved sleep. Nightly sleep appears consolidated physiologically — the wearable shows a clear and deep nocturnal heart-rate dip (large negative hourly deviations during typical sleep hours) and low intradaily variability (Z = -0.25), both consistent with stable sleep opportunity and reduced fragmentation across the recording period. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep start time are both lower than the cohort means (Z ≈ -0.7 and -0.62 respectively), a pattern that is typically protective for sleep quality. The participant reports minimal daytime napping (zero mean naps, Z = -0.86), which reduces opportunities for sleep fragmentation or sleep pressure misalignment. Perceived stress is relatively low (PSS = 17, Z = -1.26) and subjective happiness is modestly above average (Z ≈ +0.55), both of which are features that would tend to buffer against severe sleep complaints. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness that often co-occurs with more restorative nocturnal physiology.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: The data present a mixed but largely intermediate profile. Objective physiology and behavioral regularity (consolidated nighttime heart-rate dip, low sleep-timing and duration variability, no naps) argue for reasonably intact sleep continuity, whereas elevated trait anxiety, late habitual bedtimes, lower self-esteem, and relatively high evening leisure media use are plausible contributors to worse subjective sleep. Given the balance of protective objective markers and psychosocial risk markers, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s overall sleep quality is close to the study sample average rather than at a clear extreme. In statistical terms, the participant’s inferred PSQI is likely near the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72, SD = 2.16), plausibly within about one standard deviation of that mean. This conclusion emphasizes mixed risk and protective signals rather than a clear determination of especially good or poor sleep.

Clinical/scientific considerations: If the goal is to reduce subjective sleep disturbance, the most actionable areas suggested by these data are (1) addressing evening timing and pre-sleep routines (shifting sleep onset earlier or reducing late-night media/music), and (2) interventions targeting anxiety/rumination (given the elevated STAI score), both of which may reduce PSQI-relevant complaints even if objective sleep continuity is reasonably preserved."
17020,"Summary of protective (PSQI-lowering) indicators:
Several wearable and self-report features in this record point toward objectively adequate sleep opportunity and preserved nocturnal autonomic downregulation—both factors that tend to be associated with lower (better) PSQI scores. Median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 7 minutes (Z = -0.08), which is near the study mean and within commonly recommended ranges. The participant has a very low resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, Z = -1.18) and large negative hourly heart-rate deviations overnight (e.g., heart rate reductions of ~10–16 bpm between about 2:00–7:00 AM), indicating robust nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence consistent with consolidated physiological sleep. Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm is slightly above the sample mean (value = 0.43, Z = 0.17), and the low rate of napping (mean daily naps = 0.07, Z = -0.08) suggests limited daytime sleep that would otherwise fragment nocturnal sleep opportunity. On the self-report side, depressive symptoms are low–moderate (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) and self-esteem is high (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26), both of which are associated with better sleep in this sample (CES-D negatively associated with better sleep; self-esteem correlation with PSQI = -0.35).

Risk factors that are likely to increase PSQI (indicators of poorer sleep):
There are several notable behavioral and psychological features that point toward increased risk for poorer subjective sleep quality. The participant’s habitual sleep-start time is very late (median sleep onset ≈ 02:12 AM), and sleep timing shows meaningful variability across nights (sleep start SD = 72 minutes, Z = -0.23; sleep duration SD = 108 minutes, Z = 0.17). Greater night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is modestly correlated with higher PSQI in this sample (sleep duration SD correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD correlation ≈ 0.18). Trait anxiety (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13) and perceived stress (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) are both above the sample’s low end and have positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (STAI–trait correlation ≈ 0.40; CES-D correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.49 for depressive symptomology), suggesting that internalizing symptoms may be contributing to subjective sleep disturbance. Daily behavioral context also provides limited social and physical activity supports: exercise frequency is low (exercising alone less than 1–2 times/month, Z = -1.18), and socializing time is minimal (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41), both patterns that can be associated with worse sleep regulation. Non-prescribed substance use is minimal, so it is unlikely to account for sleep problems, but elevated evening/late-night schedules and variable timing remain salient risk factors.

Circadian and physiological rhythm interpretation:
Circadian-analysis measures present a mixed picture. The heart-rate mesor (mean level) and amplitude are both low relative to the sample (mesor = 59.63, Z = -1.95; amplitude = 7.04, Z = -1.21). Lower amplitude can reflect a blunted day–night contrast in physiological arousal, which in some contexts relates to poorer sleep or less robust circadian entrainment (amplitude correlation with PSQI ≈ -0.11, modest). Intradaily variability of the heart-rate rhythm is elevated (value = 0.64, Z = 0.67), indicating greater fragmentation of the 24-hour activity/rest pattern; however, in this dataset intradaily variability shows almost no correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.01). The participant’s acrophase (peak heart-rate timing) at ~4:51 PM is within an expected waking-day phase. Taken together, physiology shows strong nocturnal downregulation (protective) but also blunted amplitude and somewhat greater within-day fragmentation (mixed/ambiguous with respect to subjective sleep quality).

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population mean PSQI:
Balancing the evidence, the participant exhibits both objective strengths (adequate median sleep duration, robust nocturnal heart-rate declines, low resting heart rate, low napping) and clear behavioral/psychological risk factors (very late and somewhat irregular sleep timing, elevated perceived stress and trait anxiety, low exercise and social activity). The factors most strongly tied to worse subjective sleep in this dataset—internalizing symptoms (depression/anxiety), perceived stress, and night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration—are present at levels that meaningfully increase the likelihood of a higher PSQI. Therefore, the overall pattern is most consistent with sleep quality that is modestly poorer than average for this study sample. In summary: based on the available multimodal indicators, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI (i.e., somewhat worse than the sample average of 6.72), rather than substantially better. This conclusion is tempered by objective indicators of preserved physiological sleep processes, so the likely elevation in PSQI may be driven more by late/irregular schedules and psychological stress/anxiety than by insufficient total sleep time or frank physiological impairment."
29885,"Summary of signals consistent with poorer sleep quality
- Several psychosocial and behavioral indicators in the record point toward factors that commonly elevate PSQI scores. The participant reports elevated depressive symptomatology (CES‑D = 17, Z = 0.38) and moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17); in the study sample these measures are positively correlated with PSQI (CES‑D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40), indicating an increased likelihood that subjective sleep quality is degraded. The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:57), which reduces sleep opportunity relative to conventional schedules and can reflect circadian misalignment that often associates with poorer subjective sleep. Wearable-derived heart‑rate activity shows pronounced elevations in the late evening (notably the 9–10pm hour with a large deviation from mesor, Z = 1.90, and a positive deviation at 12–1am, Z ≈ 0.99), which may index late-evening physiological activation or engagement (social/technology/alcohol-related arousal) that can increase sleep latency and reduce perceived sleep quality. Alcohol use at a frequency of 1–2 times per week (beer and wine/liquor each Z ≈ 1.0) is another behavioral factor that, while moderate, is associated in the literature with disrupted sleep continuity and next‑day sleep complaints. Taken together—late bedtimes, evening cardiovascular activation, and elevated mood/anxiety symptoms—these elements favor a relatively higher (worse) PSQI score.

Summary of signals consistent with better sleep quality
- Several objective and behavioral features argue in the opposite direction and suggest relatively good or stable sleep physiology. The participant’s nocturnal heart‑rate profile shows a robust nocturnal decline (large negative deviations from mesor across ~2:00–7:00am; e.g., −21 to −27 bpm deviations with Z-scores ≈ −1.2 to −1.6), consistent with consolidated, physiologically restorative sleep and intact nocturnal parasympathetic dominance. Circadian-summary metrics indicate strong and regular daily structure: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.53, Z = 1.0), intradaily variability is low (0.43, Z = −0.81), amplitude is relatively large (14.65, Z = 1.25), and 24‑hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z = 1.06) — together these point to a stable, well-entrained circadian rhythm, which is generally protective for sleep quality. The participant’s sleep timing and duration are also consistent night‑to‑night (sleep start SD ≈ 35 minutes, Z = −1.06; sleep duration SD ≈ 35 minutes, Z = −1.50), indicating low variability in the sleep schedule, a pattern typically associated with better objective sleep continuity. Frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.07–1.23) is another positive behavior for sleep maintenance.

Balanced interpretation and likely PSQI position relative to the study sample
- Integrating the multimodal evidence yields a mixed but interpretable picture. Objective physiology and circadian regularity are generally favorable: consistent nightly schedules, low intra‑day fragmentation, strong circadian amplitude, and a pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate nadir all suggest consolidated, restorative sleep physiology. However, subjective‑oriented risk factors (late habitual sleep timing near 02:00, evening cardiovascular activation, weekly alcohol consumption, and non‑trivial depressive and anxiety symptomatology) increase the likelihood of worse subjective sleep reports. Because the PSQI primarily captures subjective sleep quality and because depressive/anxiety symptoms in this sample show substantial positive correlations with PSQI (CES‑D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40), the psychosocial and evening-activation signals likely tilt the participant’s overall PSQI above what would be expected from the objective circadian physiology alone.
- Compared to the study population mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the combined evidence suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean (i.e., somewhat poorer sleep quality than average). The elevation is not unambiguous or extreme given the protective objective circadian features; a reasonable inference is a modestly higher PSQI score (above 6.72) rather than a very high outlying score.

Key caveats and considerations
- Correlations between many wearable features and PSQI in the sample are small or mixed, so the inference should be treated as probabilistic rather than definitive. Objective nocturnal physiology and regularity reduce the probability of severe objective sleep fragmentation, but subjective complaints (which drive PSQI) are more sensitive to mood and evening arousal. If clinical decisions or interventions are contemplated, targeted follow‑up assessments of sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep components (sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction) would refine the estimate; behavioral interventions that address late‑night activation (timing of alcohol use, evening stimulation, and pre‑sleep arousal) and mood symptoms could be expected to yield the largest improvements in subjective sleep quality."
79167,"Summary of objective sleep and physiological markers: Wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of about 8 hours 11 minutes (Z = +1.25) with a median sleep start near 23:31 and no habitual napping. Night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 87 minutes) and start time (SD ≈ 65 minutes) are modest but not extreme (Z-scores ≈ -0.3 to -0.4). The participant’s aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate trough (largest deviations −18 to −21 bpm between ~2:00–4:00 AM) and a clear morning rise (notably +5–12 bpm between 6:00–11:00 AM), and a relatively low resting heart rate (52.7 bpm, Z = −0.65). These features—sustained nightly sleep duration, an identifiable nocturnal cardiovascular nadir, low resting heart rate, and absence of naps—are generally consistent with physiologic patterns expected in people with reasonably consolidated sleep.

Evidence suggesting relatively good sleep quality (predictors of lower PSQI): Several behavioral and self-report indices point toward lower sleep disturbance risk. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = −1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = −1.71), high subjective health satisfaction (Z = +2.05), elevated happiness (Z = +1.64) and above-average self-esteem (Z = +1.24). Exercise frequency is high (≥ three times/week; Z ≈ +1.1 to +1.6 across items), screen- and sedentary-time are minimal, and mean daily naps are zero. Many of these measures have non-trivial correlations with PSQI in the study (e.g., CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), and the participant’s low scores on these risk measures therefore favor a relatively low PSQI (better subjective sleep quality).

Evidence suggesting factors that could increase sleep disturbance (predictors of higher PSQI): Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart-rate show some indications of reduced rhythmic robustness. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.28, Z = −1.07), amplitude is reduced (7.58, Z = −1.03), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z ≈ −0.87). Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.65, Z = +0.74). Collectively these features point to a blunted and less stable daily rhythm in heart rate across days, which can be associated with sleep timing irregularity or circadian misalignment and thus with worse sleep in some populations. That said, the correlations between these specific circadian metrics and PSQI in the sample are small to modest (mostly near zero to −0.11), so their predictive weight is limited relative to stronger psychosocial correlates.

Holistic synthesis and comparative statement: Balancing the lines of evidence, the participant shows multiple protective indicators for sleep quality—long median nightly sleep, low resting heart rate and clear nighttime cardiovascular dip, minimal napping, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, frequent exercise, and high subjective health/happiness—that together make it more likely that their global sleep quality (PSQI) is better than average in this sample. Contrastingly, some measures of circadian regularity are blunted (lower interdaily stability and amplitude, higher intradaily variability), which could elevate sleep disturbance risk, but these circadian markers show relatively small correlations with PSQI in the study and are only modest deviations. On balance, and with appropriate caution because an actual PSQI score is not provided, the overall pattern is most consistent with a PSQI below the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73, SD = 2.16)—that is, likely better-than-average sleep quality relative to this sample.

Caveats and uncertainty: This inference is probabilistic. Some circadian rhythm irregularities could reflect situational factors (e.g., variable schedule during an academic semester) that might intermittently worsen sleep even if median duration is high. Correlations between many wearable circadian metrics and PSQI are small in the sample, so objective circadian irregularity should be treated as a potential (not definitive) risk factor here. If available, the participant’s actual PSQI total score or sleep-efficiency metrics from the device would reduce uncertainty and allow a firmer conclusion."
22455,"Summary: The multimodal data indicate a mixed sleep profile with several signals that typically accompany reduced sleep quality alongside a number of protective features. Wearable-recorded median nightly sleep time is short (6 hr 7 min; Z = -1.33), sleep duration is variable across nights (SD = 142 min; Z = +0.94), and objective circadian rhythm metrics show reduced amplitude (Amplitude Z = -1.52) and lower interdaily stability (Z = -0.90). Concurrent self-report data show elevated perceived stress (PSS score 30; Z = +2.28) and high evening screen use (TV, internet, music each 3–4 hours; TV Z = +2.54). Taken together, these features point toward sleep that is shorter, more irregular, and more vulnerable to disturbance than the average participant in the study sample.

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep (higher PSQI): Short median sleep duration and above-average night-to-night variability are both associated with worse subjective sleep. Elevated perceived stress (large positive Z) aligns with increased likelihood of sleep complaints. Behavioral factors that correlate positively with poorer PSQI — high evening/late-day screen exposure (television/internet/music) and low interdaily stability and circadian amplitude in heart-rate rhythms — further support risk for fragmented or non-restorative sleep. The aggregated hourly heart-rate profile includes an unusually large early-morning elevation relative to the participant’s mesor (5–6am deviation Z = +6.20 and 6–7am Z = +4.31), which may reflect pronounced morning arousal or activity after awakenings; when present in aggregate this pattern can be associated with a compressed sleep window or early-morning activation that reduces perceived sleep quality. The combination of short sleep, variable timing, reduced circadian robustness, and high stress is consistent with factors that tend to raise PSQI scores.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep (lower PSQI): Several protective signals counterbalance the above risks. The participant reports little to no use of alcohol or recreational/nonprescribed drugs, which reduces a common source of sleep disruption. Habitual exercise frequency is above the study median (exercises alone three or more times per week; Z ≈ +1.07), and nap frequency is low (mean daily naps 0.13; Z = +0.70 but small absolute), both of which are generally favorable for nocturnal sleep consolidation. Self-report measures show low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.31), modest depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = -0.14), relatively high happiness (Z = +1.64) and health satisfaction (Z = +1.96), and a relatively low resting heart rate (53.8 bpm; Z = -0.52) — each of which tends to be associated with fewer subjective sleep complaints in many samples. The median sleep start time (~23:20) is not extremely late and sleep-timing variability is only modest (start-time SD Z = -0.37), which can mitigate some circadian misalignment effects.

Physiological/circadian interpretation: Cosinor and nonparametric heart-rate rhythm metrics indicate a lower-amplitude, less-stable circadian signal (low amplitude, low interdaily stability, modestly elevated intradaily variability). Lower amplitude and stability are commonly linked with poorer sleep continuity and increased sleep complaints, whereas the relatively low MESOR and low resting heart rate are consistent with a physically fit profile that can be protective. The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show strong nocturnal heart-rate suppression during typical sleep hours (large negative deviations around 1–4am) and a pronounced rebound in the early morning (large positive deviations at 5–7am). This pattern suggests consolidated nocturnal physiological sleep but relatively sharp activation on awakening; if awakenings are occurring late in the night or if awakening is abrupt, subjective sleep quality can be adversely affected despite physiological sleep depth earlier in the night.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Balancing the risk and protective features, the overall profile most closely aligns with a PSQI that is above the population mean (worse sleep than the average study participant). Key drivers of this inference are objectively short median sleep duration (≈6:07), elevated night-to-night variability, reduced circadian amplitude and stability, high perceived stress, and high evening screen exposure — factors that have nontrivial associations with higher PSQI scores in this dataset. Protective factors (regular exercise, low substance use, low anxiety/depression scores, high happiness and health satisfaction, and a relatively normal sleep-start time) reduce the likelihood of very poor sleep but do not fully offset the combination of short, irregular sleep and high stress. Compared with the study population mean PSQI of 6.73, this participant’s pattern is most consistent with a PSQI somewhat above that mean rather than substantially below it."
57443,"Summary conclusion
Considering the full set of self-report and wearable-derived metrics, the participant’s pattern is mixed: objective behavioral and circadian indicators derived from the wearable point toward relatively good and stable sleep, while self-report symptom measures (particularly depressive symptoms and elevated perceived stress) point toward risk for worse subjective sleep. Integrating these lines of evidence, the participant’s overall sleep quality as inferred from the data is likely near or slightly below the study sample mean PSQI (i.e., similar to or marginally better than the sample mean PSQI of 6.73), with a notable discrepancy between objective stability and psychosocial risk factors that could increase subjective sleep complaints.

Features suggesting higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality)
Several self-report measures that correlate positively with higher PSQI scores indicate risk for poorer sleep. The CES-D score of 19 (Z = 0.59) is elevated and has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r = 0.50), which implies that depressive symptom burden may be associated with more severe perceived sleep problems. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92; correlation with PSQI r = 0.20), and trait anxiety is at a mid-to-elevated level (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13; correlation r = 0.40). Together these affective factors are the strongest psychosocial signals in the dataset supporting a greater likelihood of worse subjective sleep (higher PSQI). A mildly elevated resting heart rate (61.2 bpm, Z = 0.36; correlation r = 0.12) and small positive correlations between some nocturnal heart-rate features and PSQI (e.g., early-morning deviations with small positive r-values) also marginally support physiological arousal that could be linked to worse sleep for some individuals.

Features suggesting lower PSQI (better sleep quality)
Wearable sleep and circadian metrics provide several signals consistent with relatively good sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 14 minutes (Z = 0.06), essentially at the sample mean, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is low (SD = 42 minutes, Z = -1.33), which is a robust protective feature associated with better sleep quality. The participant shows high interdaily stability (0.50, Z = 0.75) and an elevated autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.46, Z = 1.15), indicating a consistent day-to-day circadian structure; amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is above average (Amplitude = 12.91, Z = 0.69), which is typically associated with healthier circadian regulation and lower sleep disturbance in this sample (amplitude correlation r = -0.11). The absence of naps, very low substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs), normal BMI (21.2), and reasonable health satisfaction are additional behavioral and health features that tend to be linked with better objective sleep outcomes.

Integrated interpretation and likely PSQI placement relative to the sample
Objectively, the participant exhibits a stable circadian profile and consistent sleep duration with low night-to-night variability—characteristics that typically translate to lower (better) PSQI scores compared with peers. Subjectively and psychosocially, however, elevated depressive symptoms and perceived stress (both positively correlated with PSQI, especially the CES-D) increase the likelihood of more severe self-reported sleep problems. Given the relative strengths of these two domains in the data (strong objective stability and adequate duration versus meaningful but not extreme affective symptoms), the most parsimonious inference is that the participant’s overall sleep quality would be near the study sample mean PSQI and plausibly slightly better (i.e., a PSQI at or modestly below the population mean of 6.73). However, there is a realistic probability that subjective PSQI could be higher than objective indicators predict, driven by depressive symptoms and stress. In short: objective wearable metrics point toward somewhat better-than-average sleep, while self-report affective burden raises the risk that the participant’s subjective PSQI might approach or exceed the sample mean.

Key caveats
This synthesis treats wearable-derived sleep regularity and duration as indicators of likely objective sleep health and treats self-report affective scales as predictors of subjective sleep complaints; the PSQI itself is subjective, and the correlation patterns here indicate that depression and stress are among the strongest predictors of higher PSQI in this dataset. The analysis is probabilistic rather than diagnostic: it highlights risk and protective factors and estimates relative placement against the sample mean (6.73) rather than providing a definitive PSQI score."
94579,"Summary: Multi-modal data from self-report and wearable sources describe a profile of relatively late, irregular sleep timing combined with signs of elevated affective symptoms and otherwise health-supportive behaviors. The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 24, Z = +1.11) and above-average trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = +0.27), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40). Wearable sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 h 38 min (Z = -0.69, shorter than the sample mean) and a very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 242 min, Z = +3.21). Bedtimes are late (median sleep start ≈ 02:08) with substantial night-to-night variability in sleep start time (SD = 153 min, Z = +1.54). Circadian summary metrics indicate a discernible daily rhythm in heart rate (amplitude and MESOR in the typical range; acrophase ~4:17 PM) and moderately high interdaily stability (0.49, Z = +0.67).

Evidence pointing toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several convergent indicators support an interpretation of elevated sleep disturbance. Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are among the strongest survey correlates of worse PSQI in this sample, and the participant’s scores are above the population mean (CES‑D Z = +1.11; STAI modestly above mean). Nightly sleep is shorter than average and highly inconsistent: the median duration is below typical recommendations and night-to-night variability in duration is extreme (SD Z = +3.21), a characteristic that is strongly associated with poorer subjective sleep. Late median sleep onset (~02:08) and large variability in sleep start time (Z = +1.54) are consistent with delayed and irregular sleep timing, factors that commonly worsen sleep quality and increase PSQI. Wearable-derived hourly heart rate deviations show less pronounced decreases around the first half of the night (e.g., midnight–1am deviation less negative than later night), and several overnight hourly deviations have small positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., 3–4am r ≈ 0.23), which may indicate periods of greater nocturnal physiological arousal that align with poorer sleep reported in the sample.

Evidence pointing toward better sleep quality (lower PSQI): There are also objective and behavioral features that tend to protect sleep. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising three times a week or more; Z-scores for exercise behaviors +1.07 to +1.58), low alcohol and drug use, no daily naps (Z = -0.86), and relatively high health satisfaction (Z = +0.55). Resting heart rate is low (57.6 bpm, Z = -0.07) and wearable cosinor metrics show a clear circadian amplitude and an interdaily stability above the sample mean (Z ≈ +0.67), indicating the presence of a reasonably structured day–night pattern in cardiovascular activity. These features (regular daytime activity, fitness, low substance use) generally correlate modestly with better sleep and may buffer some negative effects of late timing.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Balancing all evidence, the pattern is most consistent with sleep quality that is worse than the study population mean (i.e., a higher PSQI score than the sample average of 6.73). The strongest contributors to this inference are elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety (high PSQI correlates), a late median sleep onset and very large variability in both sleep timing and duration (highly predictive of poor subjective sleep), and wearable indications of nocturnal physiological changes that modestly correlate with PSQI. Protective factors — frequent exercise, low substance use, no naps, and a clear circadian amplitude/interdaily stability — are present and likely moderate the degree of impairment, but they do not fully counterbalance the combined effects of mood symptoms and marked sleep irregularity. In summary: relative to the study sample, the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean (worse than average), with irregular timing and affective symptom burden being the most salient drivers of that elevation."
29257,"Summary of physiological and behavioral patterns:
Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics indicate a participant with a clear day–night heart rate rhythm but with some features of irregular timing. The cosinor MESOR (72.96 bpm) and resting heart rate (59.2 bpm) are close to the study mean, while circadian amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude = 8.46; Z = -0.75), and interdaily stability is relatively low (Interdaily Stability = 0.26; Z = -1.23). Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a robust nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations 2–7 AM) consistent with consolidated sleep episodes, and an acrophase in the late afternoon (5:43 PM), which is typical for active daytime physiology. Self-report and trait measures are generally favorable: low depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D = 2, Z = -1.18; STAI = 31, Z = -1.02), above-average self-esteem (Z = 1.1), reasonable health satisfaction (Z = 0.72), and minimal napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86).

Evidence suggesting relatively poorer sleep quality (factors associated with higher PSQI):
Several features are consistent with factors that typically elevate PSQI scores. Bed timing is late: the median sleep start time is 01:32:30, which may increase vulnerability to sleep disturbance and social/chronobiological misalignment. Night-to-night variability in total sleep time is high (sleep duration SD = 151 minutes; Z = 1.14), and this variability has a modest positive correlation with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.21), indicating that inconsistent sleep duration likely contributes to poorer subjective sleep. Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm is low (Z = -1.23), suggesting irregular day-to-day timing of activity and physiology; reduced stability and a blunted circadian amplitude (Z = -0.75) are both features associated with impaired sleep consolidation or poorer subjective sleep. Social/behavioral correlates that could contribute include weekly beer consumption (1–2×/week; Z = 1.01) and extended time spent listening to music (>4 hours; Z = 2.06) — while correlations with PSQI are small in the sample, these behaviors may be temporally aligned with late bedtimes and nocturnal arousal for this individual. A small positive correlation between elevated nocturnal heart-rate deviations (notably 2–5 AM windows) and PSQI (r up to ~0.23) suggests that instances of higher physiological arousal during the night are associated with worse subjective sleep in the cohort; the participant’s hourly profile does show modest elevations at midnight and some earlier-night hours relative to the mesor.

Evidence suggesting relatively better sleep quality (factors associated with lower PSQI):
Other data indicate elements that tend to protect sleep quality. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long at 7 hours 49 minutes (Z = 0.79), which generally supports restorative sleep and is associated with lower PSQI scores when combined with consolidated sleep. The participant has essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0), which reduces opportunities for homeostatic disruption of nocturnal sleep. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough, and intradaily variability is not elevated (Intradaily Variability = 0.46; Z = -0.6), consistent with consolidated rest periods rather than highly fragmented circadian activity. Psychological resources are favorable: very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, positive self-esteem, and reasonable health satisfaction — psychological well-being that typically corresponds to lower subjective sleep disturbance. The 24-hour autocorrelation of heart-rate rhythm is above average (Autocorrelation at 24 Hours Z = 0.81), indicating a persistent 24-hour structure to physiology that can support consistent sleep quality despite variability in specific bedtimes.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI:
Taken together, the profile contains both countervailing signals. The participant achieves a healthy median total sleep duration and shows physiological markers of consolidated nocturnal rest and preserved 24-hour structure, which argue for relatively good sleep. Against that, the participant’s late median sleep onset and elevated night-to-night variability in sleep duration, along with low interdaily stability and reduced circadian amplitude, are established contributors to worse subjective sleep quality. Because several of the metrics most strongly linked to poorer PSQI (irregular timing, high variability) are present but the person retains relatively long average sleep and low symptom burden, the overall balance places this participant near the study sample mean rather than clearly better or worse. In other words, inferred sleep quality for this participant is near the population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73). The available correlations in the sample are generally modest, so the inference is that the participant’s sleep quality is neither substantially below nor substantially above the cohort average but occupies an intermediate position that could be vulnerable to worsening if sleep timing irregularity increases.

Key actionable targets suggested by the pattern (brief):
If one were to prioritize factors most likely to lower PSQI, reducing night-to-night variability and shifting sleep timing earlier or stabilizing bedtime timing would be the most directly indicated targets given this participant’s pattern of late median sleep start and high sleep-duration variability."
49539,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian patterns: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 20 minutes (Z = 0.18), a low night-to-night duration variability (SD = 36 minutes, Z = −1.47), a late median sleep start time (01:45 AM) with relatively low variability in start times (start-time SD = 39 minutes, Z = −0.96), and essentially no daytime napping (mean naps = 0.0, Z = −0.86). Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively low overall mesor (mean heart rate; Z = −1.57) and a low resting heart rate (47.8 bpm, Z = −1.23), an amplitude close to the cohort average (Z = 0.19), and an acrophase in the late afternoon/early evening (≈5:26 PM). Interdaily stability is modestly above average (Z = 0.75), but intradaily variability is a pronounced outlier (Z = 2.01), and there is a single hourly aggregate heart-rate deviation that is extreme relative to the sample (one hour with deviation Z = 4.79), indicating a reliably timed period of elevated cardiovascular arousal.

Features that tend to indicate higher PSQI (worse sleep quality): The participant’s median sleep onset near 01:45 AM represents a substantially delayed sleep schedule relative to typical collegiate sleep timing and is a common correlate of poorer subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. The high intradaily variability (Z = 2.01) suggests fragmentation or frequent transitions between activity and rest across the day, a circadian pattern that has been associated with worse sleep continuity and higher PSQI scores in group analyses. The presence of an unusually large, consistently timed heart-rate spike (Z = 4.79) also points to a recurring period of elevated physiological arousal; if this spike occurs in the late evening or near the intended sleep period it could contribute to sleep initiation or maintenance problems. Several small positive correlations in the dataset (e.g., variability in sleep duration and sleep-start variability correlations ~0.18–0.20) are consistent with these elements being modestly associated with higher PSQI in the cohort.

Features that tend to indicate lower PSQI (better sleep quality): Objective sleep quantity is adequate by conventional standards (median ~7 h 20 min) and is slightly above the cohort average (Z = 0.18). Night-to-night regularity of sleep duration and start times is better than average (negative Z-scores for SDs), which typically protects against poor subjective sleep. The participant reports minimal depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D Z = −1.07; STAI Z = −1.81) and low substance use, both psychosocial conditions that are usually associated with better sleep reports. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate and a modest mesor suggest good cardiovascular fitness and lower basal arousal, which are also associated with better sleep quality. Interdaily stability is modestly elevated (Z = 0.75), indicating a degree of day-to-day regularity that supports sleep health. Self-reported lifestyle indicators (limited evening screen time, minimal napping, low alcohol/drug use) further favor better subjective sleep.

Integrated appraisal and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows several objective and subjective features that support relatively good sleep quality (adequate average sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, few naps, low mood/anxiety symptoms, low resting heart rate, and modest day-to-day regularity). Countervailing signals—chiefly the late habitual sleep onset (~1:45 AM), a marked elevation in intradaily variability (Z = 2.01), and a pronounced, consistently timed hour of elevated heart rate (Z = 4.79)—represent meaningful risks for sleep disturbance, particularly around sleep initiation or continuity. Taken together, the weight of the objective and self-report indicators suggests the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely at or modestly better than the study sample average (i.e., their inferred PSQI is near to or below the population mean PSQI = 6.73). This conclusion should be read as probabilistic: the late sleep timing and the pronounced intradaily variability are notable, actionable features that could shift subjective sleep quality upward (worse) under stress or schedule changes, even though current measures mostly align with relatively lower PSQI values.

Caveats: These inferences combine cross-sectional, aggregated wearable metrics, and single-time self-report inventories; correlations with PSQI within the cohort are generally small for many metrics, and temporal context (e.g., whether the high HR hour occurs just before bedtime) is not provided. If clinical or intervention decisions are contemplated, targeted assessment of sleep latency, night-time awakenings, daytime functioning, and the timing of the observed HR spike would clarify whether the late timing and intraday fragmentation are producing meaningful subjective sleep impairment."
63904,"Summary: The multimodal data portray a pattern of short, late-timed nocturnal sleep embedded in a context of elevated internalizing symptoms but relatively regular daily physiological rhythms. Wearable-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 5 hours 49 minutes (Z = -1.69) with a median sleep start time near 01:34 AM and modest night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 30 minutes, Z = -1.61). Self-report measures indicate substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 30, Z = 1.74; CES-D ↔ PSQI r ≈ 0.50) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53, Z = 1.16; STAI ↔ PSQI r ≈ 0.40). Circadian summary metrics from heart rate show moderate-to-good day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.53, Z = 1.0; autocorrelation at 24h Z ≈ 1.06) and a typical daytime acrophase (≈ 3:36 PM), with pronounced overnight reductions in heart rate consistent with consolidated physiological rest.

Factors that point toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): 
- Short objective sleep duration: the median sleep length (~5 h 49 min) is well below typical recommendations and is substantially lower than most of the study sample (Z = -1.69), which is a strong behavioral indicator of poor sleep opportunity. 
- Late sleep timing: a median sleep onset near 1:34 AM suggests delayed sleep timing that often co-occurs with perception of poorer sleep and daytime impairment. 
- Elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety: high CES-D and STAI scores (Z = 1.74 and 1.16 respectively) are both positively correlated with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.50 and 0.40), making them among the most salient psychosocial drivers of poorer sleep quality here. 
- Low social-trust and low self-reported happiness/self-esteem: very low interpersonal trust (Z = -2.07), low happiness (Z = -1.61) and relatively low self-esteem (Z = -1.15) are associated in the sample with worse PSQI (negative protective correlations), and these psychosocial vulnerabilities plausibly exacerbate sleep complaints. 
- Low physical activity participation: near-absence of reported exercise and sports (Zs around -1.1 to -1.9) aligns with behavioral risk for worse sleep in the literature.

Factors that point toward relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI):
- Regular circadian structure: higher-than-average interdaily stability (Z = 1.0) and positive autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z ≈ 1.06) indicate a consistent daily rhythm in heart rate across the recording period, which is usually protective for sleep continuity and timing. 
- Low night-to-night variability and few naps: sleep duration variability is low (SD ≈ 30 minutes, Z = -1.61) and reported mean daily naps = 0 (Z = -0.86), both of which suggest consistent sleep opportunity across nights and may reduce fragmentation or perceived instability in sleep. 
- Wearable nocturnal physiology consistent with consolidated rest: aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines in heart rate (largest negative deviations 1–6 AM), consistent with a consolidated sleep episode physiologically; resting heart rate (~60.5 bpm, Z ≈ 0.28) is within a typical range. 
- Low substance and recreational drug use: no reported alcohol or recreational drug use (Zs negative) removes an important behavioral contributor to sleep disturbance.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample mean PSQI: Weighing the evidence, the strongest contributors to likely elevated PSQI are the short total sleep time and late sleep timing combined with substantial depressive and anxiety symptom burden—each of which is robustly associated with worse PSQI in this sample (particularly CES-D). These risk factors outweigh the protective signals from a relatively regular circadian pattern and low night-to-night variability. Therefore, the overall pattern is most consistent with a sleep quality level above the population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73). In other words, relative to the study sample this participant is likely to report worse-than-average sleep quality.

Practical implication for interpretation: physiologic rhythm regularity and the absence of substance use are positive features that could support interventions, but the combination of chronically short, late-timed sleep and elevated depressive/anxious symptoms is the primary driver of expected higher PSQI and subjective sleep impairment in this case."
20335,"Summary: The multimodal data portray a participant with a mix of risk and protective features for sleep quality. Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 35 minutes (Z = -0.74) and a consistently late habitual sleep onset (median start time 01:53), with relatively low night-to-night variability in start time (SD 27 minutes, Z = -1.24). Circadian summary measures indicate a well-structured rhythm in heart-rate (interdaily stability = 0.57, Z = 1.33; amplitude Z = 0.90; autocorrelation at 24h Z = 0.90). Self-report inventories show low depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D Z = -1.18; STAI Z = -1.81), high self-esteem (Z = 1.66), good health satisfaction (Z = 1.30), regular exercise (exercised alone three times/week or more, Z = 1.07), and low napping frequency. Taken together, these elements indicate a participant with strong circadian regularity and favorable psychological functioning but a late, somewhat short sleep schedule.

Features that suggest poorer sleep quality (likely to increase PSQI): 
- Habitual late sleep timing: the median sleep onset just before 2:00 AM is substantially delayed relative to typical collegiate schedules and is a recognized risk factor for sleep complaints and shorter total sleep opportunity. 
- Shorter-than-recommended nightly duration: median sleep duration of ~6.6 hours is below common adult recommendations and is associated with worse PSQI components in many samples (duration Z = -0.74). 
- Elevated late-evening physiological arousal: wearable hourly heart-rate deviations show a very large positive deviation at 12–1 AM (mean deviation +23.9 bpm, Z = 3.66) and positive deviations in late evening hours (e.g., 6–7 PM, 11–12 AM). The pronounced HR elevation around midnight suggests behavioral or physiological activation in the late evening period (e.g., cognitive/emotional arousal, social/entertainment activities) that may interfere with sleep initiation and perceived sleep quality. 
- Leisure and sedentary engagement late in the day: self-report indicates above-average time on sedentary hobbies and evening media/gaming (sedentary hobby Z = 2.01; video games Z = 1.71), behaviors that often co-occur with late bedtimes and can reduce sleep opportunity or sleep efficiency.

Features that suggest better sleep quality (likely to decrease PSQI):
- Strong circadian regularity and rhythmicity: interdaily stability is relatively high (0.57, Z = 1.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation is above average (Z = 0.90), indicating consistent day-to-day timing of activity and rest that typically supports sleep consolidation and lower sleep disturbance. Sleep start time variability is low (SD Z = -1.24), which is generally protective for sleep quality. 
- Favorable psychological profile: very low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D and STAI well below sample mean) and high self-esteem and health satisfaction—these have medium associations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.49; STAI = 0.40) so the participant’s low symptom burden weighs substantially toward better subjective sleep. 
- Physical fitness / cardiovascular indicators: a relatively low resting heart rate (55 bpm, Z = -0.37) and regular exercise are consistent with better sleep efficiency and resilience to sleep disturbance in some studies. Low frequency of naps (mean daily naps 0.08) also reduces fragmentation of nocturnal sleep opportunity.

Physiological timing and heart-rate profile interpretation: the cosinor-derived circadian parameters (MESOR ~78 bpm, amplitude Z = 0.90, acrophase ~6:06 PM) and the pattern of hourly deviations indicate a well-defined rhythm with an evening peak in cardiovascular activity. The very large positive deviation at midnight stands out as discrepant from otherwise nocturnally lower heart-rate values; since the participant typically initiates sleep around 1:53 AM, the midnight HR elevation likely reflects late-evening activity or arousal prior to sleep rather than fragmented nocturnal physiology. Overnight hours (1–7 AM) show negative deviations from mesor (lower heart-rate), consistent with consolidated sleep-related physiology once sleep is obtained.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16): weighing the evidence, the participant displays several protective features that are strongly related to better PSQI in this sample—particularly low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, strong interdaily stability, consistent sleep timing, and regular exercise. Offsetting these are clear risk indicators: a late habitual bedtime, somewhat short nightly sleep duration, and late-evening physiological activation likely linked to evening behaviors. On balance, the data indicate overall sleep quality that is near the study population mean but modestly better than average (i.e., slightly below the population mean PSQI). In other words, the participant’s PSQI-related risk is not markedly elevated relative to peers, although the late sleep timing and limited sleep duration represent actionable targets to further reduce sleep complaints."
35031,"Summary — The participant’s data show a mixed profile: objective, wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular markers point toward circadian irregularity and elevated physiological arousal, whereas self-report mental-health indices and total sleep time suggest relatively preserved subjective functioning and adequate sleep duration. Key large deviations from the study sample are an elevated resting heart rate (75.5 bpm; Z = +2.06), markedly reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -1.85), low interdaily stability (Z = -1.81) and low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = -1.87). At the same time median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 3 min; Z = +1.08) and self-report measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms are below sample means (CES-D Z = -0.76; STAI Z = -1.41).

Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI) — Several objective indicators point toward features typically associated with higher PSQI scores: (1) circadian rhythm disruption and low day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.19, Z = -1.81; autocorrelation24h Z = -1.87; reduced amplitude Z = -1.85), which are commonly linked to fragmented or inefficient sleep; (2) a comparatively high resting heart rate and high mesor (RHR Z = +2.06; mesor Z = +1.13), which can reflect elevated sympathetic tone or incomplete nocturnal recovery; and (3) elevated intradaily variability (Z = +1.16) and substantial variability in sleep onset (sleep start SD ≈ 96 minutes), both consistent with irregular sleep timing and within-day fragmentation. The hourly heart-rate deviations also show notable evening/late-night positive departures from the mesor (e.g., ~+8–+10 bpm around 10:00–12:00 AM), which is compatible with later physiological arousal or activity near usual sleep onset. Moderate alcohol use and substantial evening social activity (both Z ≈ +0.9–1.0) could further contribute to later bedtimes or nighttime arousal and thus to worse subjective sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with better sleep quality (lower PSQI) — Other features argue for relatively preserved sleep: median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 3 min, Z = +1.08) and naps are infrequent (mean daily naps 0.14, Z = +0.82), both of which tend to be associated with fewer reported sleep problems. Self-reported psychological burden is low-to-moderate (low CES-D and STAI scores, PSS Z = -0.98), and health satisfaction is near the sample mean (Z ≈ +0.13); lower depression/anxiety and lower perceived stress often predict better subjective sleep. Regular, even if modest, physical activity (exercising 1–2×/week) and limited use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs are additional behavioral factors that would tend to support better sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample mean PSQI — Balancing the convergent evidence, the objective circadian and cardiovascular signals (large-magnitude z-scores for resting heart rate, amplitude, interdaily stability and autocorrelation) are most suggestive of physiologic and behavioral patterns that commonly accompany worse sleep quality, despite the participant’s relatively long total sleep time and low self-reported mood symptoms. Given the combination of pronounced circadian irregularity and elevated nocturnal/evening heart-rate elevation together with variable bedtimes, the overall inference is that this participant’s sleep quality is likely somewhat worse than average in this sample. In terms of the study’s PSQI distribution (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16), the participant’s profile is best described as near to slightly above the population mean PSQI (i.e., somewhat poorer sleep quality than the sample average), rather than clearly well below it. This conclusion is probabilistic and tempered by the modest direct correlations between many individual metrics and PSQI in the dataset; thus objective circadian dysfunction and elevated resting heart rate are the primary drivers of the inference toward worse-than-average sleep.

Limitations and caveats — The evidence is mixed, and objective and subjective measures sometimes diverge (long objectively measured sleep but physiological signs of arousal and circadian disruption). Correlations between many individual metrics and PSQI are small, so the inference should be treated as an integrative, probabilistic judgment rather than a definitive PSQI score."
88185,"Summary of objective sleep behavior: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration of 6 hours 37 minutes (Z = -0.70), with a median sleep start time of about 02:25 AM and night-to-night sleep duration variability of ~62 minutes (Z = -0.87). The participant takes essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). These metrics indicate a habitual short sleep episode and a markedly delayed sleep schedule relative to typical collegiate timing, with moderately low variability in total sleep time across nights.

Circadian and physiological patterning: Heart-rate–based circadian features are relatively robust. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.57, Z = 1.33), amplitude is high (14.05, Z = 1.06), and the cosinor acrophase is in the late afternoon (around 5:00 PM), consistent with a consolidated daytime activity peak and stable day-to-day structure. Resting heart rate is low–normal (57.3 bpm, Z = -0.10). Hourly aggregate HR deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM, reaching ~-26 bpm at 6–7 AM) and consistent daytime positive deviations around midday and afternoon; this pattern is typical of intact nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence and a strong day–night contrast.

Psychological and lifestyle context: Self-report measures indicate low depressive and trait-anxiety symptom burden (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66; STAI = 29, Z = -1.22), above-average self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.82), relatively high current happiness (Z = 1.64), low alcohol and drug use, and regular solitary exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.07). Listening to music is a prominent leisure activity. Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS Z = -0.44). These psychosocial and behavioral indicators are generally associated with better subjective sleep quality in the study sample (many show negative correlations with PSQI or low correlations).

Factors that point toward higher PSQI scores (worse sleep quality)
- Short median sleep duration (~6 h 37 min; Z = -0.70). Short habitual sleep is a common contributor to worse PSQI components (sleep duration, sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction).
- Late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:25 AM). Delayed sleep timing can contribute to perceived poor sleep quality and mismatch with daytime obligations, increasing PSQI global score via difficulties with sleep latency or daytime dysfunction.
- Some residual night-to-night variability in sleep start time (SD ~88 minutes, though Z = 0.11 near the cohort mean), which can exacerbate subjective sleep complaints when combined with late timing.

Factors that point toward lower PSQI scores (better sleep quality)
- Strong circadian regularity and amplitude (interdaily stability Z = 1.33; amplitude Z = 1.06), and a clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir; these features are associated with consolidated sleep and lower PSQI in the cohort (amplitude and stability have small negative correlations with PSQI).
- Low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and relatively high well-being (CES-D and STAI well below sample means; happiness and self-esteem above average). Given moderate positive correlations between affective symptoms and PSQI in the sample (e.g., CES-D r ≈ 0.49), the participant’s low symptom burden is a protective factor.
- Low substance use and regular exercise (exercising alone ≥3×/week, minimal alcohol/drug use), both of which are behavioral profiles that tend to relate to better sleep quality in population analyses.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Weighing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile. Objective physiology and circadian metrics indicate strong rhythmicity and intact nocturnal cardiovascular decline—features that tend to support good sleep consolidation—while psychosocial and lifestyle measures are generally favorable and protective. In contrast, the participant’s habitual sleep is delayed and somewhat short in duration, which are relevant risk factors for higher PSQI. Taken together, the net pattern suggests overall sleep quality that is close to the study sample average rather than markedly better or worse. Therefore, relative to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s inferred sleep quality is most consistent with being near the population mean (neither clearly substantially above nor substantially below it).

Notes on uncertainty and practical implications: The wearable-derived signals support physiological sleep consolidation but do not capture subjective components of sleep quality (e.g., perceived restfulness, sleep disturbances) that can drive PSQI differences. If a more definitive estimate of the participant’s PSQI is needed, integrating their subjective sleep complaint items (sleep latency, sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction) or administering the PSQI directly would provide clearer classification. Behavioral targets that could reduce the likelihood of elevated PSQI are modest extensions of sleep opportunity (earlier sleep timing, slight increase in total nightly sleep) given the current late schedule and below-recommended duration."
35344,"Indicators consistent with relatively poor sleep quality (predicting a higher PSQI) are prominent in the self-report data. The participant reports high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 28, Z = 1.53) and high trait anxiety (STAI = 62, Z = 2.05); in this sample these measures have substantial positive correlations with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40, respectively), which means higher symptom burden on these scales is strongly associated with worse reported sleep. Lower self‑reported happiness and relatively low self‑esteem (RSES Z = -1.57), together with a modestly elevated perceived stress score (PSS Z = 0.65), further align with patterns that tend to co-occur with poorer subjective sleep. Behavioral factors that weakly favor poorer sleep (small positive PSQI correlations) include regular alcohol use at the 1–2 times/week level (Z ≈ 1) and greater time spent watching video content (Z ≈ 0.64). Physiologically, resting heart rate is somewhat elevated relative to the study sample (RHR = 63.8 bpm, Z = 0.67) and some early-night/early-morning hourly heart-rate deviations show small positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., 2–4 AM deviations correlate ~0.20–0.23), which could reflect nocturnal arousal that is associated with worse sleep reports.

Conversely, several objective behavioral and circadian features point toward relatively good sleep (predicting a lower PSQI). Wearable-derived sleep duration is substantial: median nightly sleep of 7 hours 47 minutes (Z = 0.74) is longer than the sample mean and is generally consistent with adequate sleep opportunity. Night-to-night variability in both sleep duration (SD = 92 minutes, Z = -0.21) and sleep start time (SD = 61 minutes, Z = -0.48) are not elevated relative to the cohort, and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86), all of which reduce behavioral sources of sleep disruption. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate a moderately regular rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.44, Z = 0.25) with relatively low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.56, Z = 0.10) and a normal-seeming acrophase in the mid-afternoon; additionally, overnight aggregate heart‑rate deviations show clear nocturnal dipping (large negative deviations between ~12 AM and 6 AM), which is physiologically consistent with consolidated sleep.

When integrating these lines of evidence, the strongest single contributors to an elevated PSQI in this profile are the marked affective symptoms (depression and anxiety) and related subjective well‑being measures, since those scales have the largest sample correlations with PSQI and are substantially elevated for this participant. Objective wearable indicators (adequate total sleep time, low napping, reasonable circadian stability and nocturnal HR dip) weigh in the opposite direction and suggest that sleep opportunity and sleep consolidation are relatively preserved. Because PSQI is a subjective index that captures perceived sleep quality and includes items sensitive to mood and daytime functioning, the high depressive/anxiety symptom burden argues that the participant’s reported sleep quality is likely worse than would be expected based on wearable sleep duration alone.

Overall judgment relative to the study sample: the pattern of strong affective symptoms together with modest signs of physiological arousal makes it most likely that this participant’s PSQI would be above the population mean (population mean = 6.72). That is, despite objectively adequate and reasonably regular sleep timing and duration, the participant’s elevated depression/anxiety and related subjective distress make poorer self-reported sleep (PSQI > 6.72) the more probable outcome in this dataset."
31175,"Summary overview: The multimodal dataset presents a mixed profile of sleep-related behaviors and physiology. Wearable-derived sleep statistics show an unusually long median nightly sleep duration (9 h 34 min; Z = +2.96) accompanied by very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 249 minutes; Z = +3.37). Circadian features derived from heart rate point to reduced overall circadian amplitude (Amplitude Z = −0.81) and a lower mesor (Mesor Z = −1.28) alongside modestly below-average interdaily stability (Interdaily Stability Z = −0.16) but unusually low intradaily variability (Intradaily Variability Z = −1.73). Self-report measures show moderate perceived stress (PSS = 24; Z = +0.65), normative depressive symptom levels (CES-D = 12; Z = −0.14), modest trait anxiety (STAI = 40; Z = −0.13) and generally positive health satisfaction (Z = +0.63). Taken together, the pattern contains elements that plausibly increase Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score and elements that plausibly decrease it; overall, the balance of evidence suggests sleep quality is likely slightly worse than the study sample average (population mean PSQI = 6.72), though not dramatically so.

Evidence consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The single strongest objective indicator associated with poorer sleep quality is the very high variability in nightly sleep duration (SD = 249 min, Z = +3.37). Large night-to-night swings in sleep amount degrade sleep regularity and are commonly associated with higher PSQI scores; the dataset’s small positive correlation between sleep duration SD and PSQI (r ≈ 0.20) is consistent with that interpretation. Moderate perceived stress (PSS Z = +0.65) and weekly alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor both reported 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ +1.0) are additional lifestyle/psychological factors that typically relate to worse subjective sleep. Reduced circadian amplitude and lower mesor of heart rate can reflect blunted daily physiological rhythms; blunted amplitude has been associated in prior work with more fragmented or less restorative sleep and may therefore contribute to higher PSQI. Evening recreational behaviors (watching video content ~1–2 hours; internet/music use 2–3 hours) and relatively high social activity (socializing 3–4 hours; Z = +1.74) may also extend evening arousal or delay sleep timing on some nights, which would increase PSQI components linked to sleep latency, disturbances or inefficiency.

Evidence consistent with relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Several objective and behavioral indicators point toward preserved restorative physiology and sleep-promoting habits. Median nightly sleep time is substantially long (9 h 34 min; Z = +2.96), and average daily naps are minimal (mean naps = 0.08/day), suggesting the participant generally obtains ample nocturnal sleep rather than relying on daytime sleep. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.8 bpm; Z = −0.04 relative to sample, absolute value consistent with good cardiovascular conditioning), and intradaily variability in heart rate is low (Z = −1.73), which implies limited within-day fragmentation of activity/rest states — a pattern usually associated with consolidated sleep. Frequent exercise and sports (reported three times a week or more; exercise Z ≈ +1.07, sports Z ≈ +1.58) are behavioral supports for sleep quality, and the participant reports few recreational drug or non-prescribed drug exposures. Together these features support lower PSQI risk.

Physiological and circadian interpretation: Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs (strong negative deviations overnight) and daytime peaks mid-afternoon (acrophase ~3:34 PM), indicating a preserved day–night pattern of cardiovascular activity. However, the reduced amplitude and lower mesor suggest the daily extent of heart-rate variation is compressed relative to the sample, which can reflect either high baseline parasympathetic tone (e.g., athletic conditioning) or a blunted circadian drive. Interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z = −0.16), which together with the very large sleep-duration SD indicates inconsistently timed sleep across days despite intra-day consolidation. In other words, physiological sleep depth indices look favorable on many nights (clear nocturnal HR troughs, low fragmentation), but timing and duration are irregular across the recording period — a combination that often produces mixed subjective sleep reports and intermediate PSQI scores.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population: Balancing the opposing signals — protective features (ample median sleep, low intradaily variability, regular daytime activity via exercise, low napping) against risk factors (extremely high night-to-night variability in sleep duration, moderate stress, reduced circadian amplitude, some evening screen/social behaviors and weekly alcohol use) — the participant’s profile most consistently aligns with a PSQI score that is near to slightly above the study sample mean. Stated succinctly: inferred overall sleep quality is slightly worse than the population mean PSQI = 6.72 (i.e., “above the population mean”), driven primarily by marked variability in nightly sleep duration and moderate psychosocial stress, even though many physiological and behavioral markers point to preserved consolidated sleep on individual nights. This interpretation is cautious: objective and subjective indicators are mixed, so the participant may experience nights of restorative long sleep interspersed with nights of poorer sleep regularity that increase average PSQI."
58793,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of behavioral, subjective, and physiological indicators relevant to sleep quality. Several objective wearable measures point to a consolidated, regular sleep-wake pattern (long median nightly sleep, low nap frequency, strong circadian amplitude and day-to-day autocorrelation), while self-report measures (notably trait anxiety, modestly lower happiness and self-esteem) and some markers of day-to-day variability suggest potential vulnerability to poorer subjective sleep. Balancing these pieces, the aggregate pattern is most consistent with sleep quality close to the study population average — probably near the mean PSQI, with a plausible tilt toward slightly better-than-average sleep rather than clearly poorer sleep.

Factors suggesting relatively poorer sleep (likely to push PSQI higher)
- Trait anxiety: The participant’s STAI–Trait score is 46 (Z = 0.46) and the STAI–PSQI correlation in this sample is moderately positive (r ≈ 0.40). Elevated trait anxiety is a well-established correlate of greater subjective sleep disturbance; in this dataset it is one of the stronger survey-based predictors of PSQI.  
- Affective/self-concept indicators: Self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (score 3.0, Z ≈ −0.53) and self-esteem is also below average (RSES = 33, Z ≈ −0.73); both measures correlate negatively with sleep quality in the sample (i.e., lower happiness and self-esteem are associated with worse PSQI). Although not large effects individually, they add to psychological risk for disturbed sleep.  
- Some behavioral/circadian irregularity: Sleep start time variability is elevated (SD ≈ 104 minutes, Z ≈ 0.46) and intradaily variability of the heart-rate rhythm is modestly elevated (intradaily variability = 0.61, Z ≈ 0.46). Greater variability and fragmentation of daily patterns are associated with worse subjective sleep in many samples and here show small positive correlations with PSQI.  
- Marked morning cardiovascular activation: The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviation shows an unusually large positive deviation in the 8–9 AM hour (≈ +30 bpm relative to mesor, Z ≈ 3.5). Such an elevated morning heart-rate spike can reflect pronounced morning physiological arousal or brisk activity transitions; if experienced as physiological stress it may contribute to daytime symptoms that are captured by PSQI components (sleep disturbance, daytime dysfunction).

Factors suggesting relatively better sleep (likely to push PSQI lower)
- Long and consolidated nocturnal sleep: Median nightly sleep duration is long (9 h 2 min; Z ≈ +2.3) and daily napping is minimal (mean naps ≈ 0.07/day). Longer nocturnal sleep and low nap burden typically correspond to fewer objective sleep interruptions and less daytime sleepiness, which should act to lower PSQI score; in this sample the correlation of duration with PSQI is small, but the magnitude here is notable.  
- Robust circadian structure: Circadian heart-rate metrics indicate a relatively strong rhythm — amplitude is elevated (≈ 13.9, Z ≈ +1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is comparatively high (≈ 0.45, Z ≈ +1.06). These features imply consistent timing of activity and rest across days, which generally supports sleep continuity and sleep quality.  
- Favorable physiological baseline and healthy behaviors: Resting heart rate is low (≈ 58.7 bpm), BMI is in the normal range (~21.5), alcohol and drug use are minimal, and exercise frequency is high (exercising alone and with others three or more times per week; Z ≈ +1.1 to +1.2). Health satisfaction is also relatively high (score 6/7, Z ≈ +1.3). These factors are associated with better sleep-related outcomes in the literature and in this sample show small negative correlations with PSQI (protective effect).  
- Low depressive symptom burden and minimal naps: CES-D score is low–moderate (10, Z ≈ −0.34; classification “not depressed”) and mean nap frequency is negligible; both characteristics reduce the likelihood that elevated PSQI is driven by mood disorder or daytime compensatory sleep.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Taken together, the participant presents a mix of protective physiological and behavioral characteristics (long consolidated sleep, strong circadian amplitude and 24-hour regularity, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, low napping) alongside psychosocial risk indicators (elevated trait anxiety, lower happiness and self-esteem, and moderate sleep timing variability). The strongest single survey predictor present here is trait anxiety (moderate positive PSQI correlation in this sample), which increases the probability of worse subjective sleep, but multiple objective markers point in the opposite direction.

Given these competing signals, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s overall sleep quality is close to the study sample average — likely “near the mean” PSQI — with a reasonable possibility of being slightly better than average (i.e., a PSQI modestly below the sample mean of 6.73), rather than substantially worse. This conclusion reflects the large positive circadian and behavioral indicators of consolidated sleep and health, tempered by anxiety-related risk and some day-to-day timing variability. Uncertainty remains; direct PSQI scores or repeated subjective sleep symptom reports would refine this estimate and help resolve the influence of anxiety-related perceptions on reported sleep quality."
96689,"The participant’s self-report and trait measures present a mixed psychological profile that is relevant to sleep. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) while trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56); anxiety has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.40), indicating that higher trait anxiety would be expected to relate to worse subjective sleep. Global self‑esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11), and perceived stress is somewhat below the sample average (PSS Z = -0.44); both of these features are aligned with lower subjective sleep disturbance in the study correlations. The participant reports relatively low health satisfaction (score 2.11, Z = -1.61), and somewhat lower current happiness (Z = -0.53), which could increase vulnerability to sleep complaints even when depressive symptoms are minimal.

Objective wearable and sleep-behavior metrics indicate several strengths in sleep quantity and circadian organization. Median nightly sleep duration (7 h 18 m, Z = 0.14) is within a range typically associated with adequate restorative sleep, and night-to-night variability in total sleep time is low (SD = 38 minutes, Z = -1.42), a feature that correlates modestly with better PSQI in this sample. The participant shows a consistent sleep onset time (median start ≈ 01:55 AM with low start-time SD of 29 minutes, Z = -1.19), and no habitual naps (Z = -0.86); regular timing and limited napping are both factors generally associated with better sleep consolidation. Circadian features derived from heart rate are comparatively robust: a relatively large amplitude (14.98, Z = 1.36), positive interdaily stability (0.50, Z = 0.75), and a clear nocturnal decline in heart rate (substantial negative deviations from mesor overnight) all point to a well‑entrained rhythm. In this dataset larger amplitude and greater stability tend to associate with better PSQI (amplitude r ≈ -0.11; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.06), so these physiological markers are supportive of comparatively good sleep quality.

At the same time, there are several indicators that could contribute to higher (worse) PSQI scores. The participant’s typical sleep onset is late (approximately 1:55 AM), which can be associated with circadian misalignment relative to conventional daytime demands and may produce daytime dysfunction or subjective sleep complaints even when total sleep time is adequate. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI Z = 0.56) and, in this study, shows a substantial positive correlation with PSQI; this suggests anxiety could increase sleep latency, nighttime awakenings, or subjective sleep disturbance. Low engagement in physical activity (exercise frequency Z-scores ≪ 0) and low health satisfaction may also contribute indirectly to poorer sleep quality over time, although the direct correlations between exercise measures and PSQI are small in this sample. Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.65, Z = 0.74), which can reflect fragmentation of activity/rest and is sometimes linked to disrupted sleep-wake organization; in this study intradaily variability has little association with PSQI, but it remains a potential risk factor when combined with late timing and anxiety.

Balancing these lines of evidence, the strongest objective indicators favoring good sleep are adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, consistent sleep timing, absence of naps and substances, and robust circadian amplitude with a clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir. The strongest indicators pointing toward poorer sleep are the late habitual sleep onset and the presence of elevated trait anxiety, together with low health satisfaction and minimal exercise. Because the objective sleep quantity and regularity markers are relatively favorable and several physiological circadian features are robust, while psychosocial risk factors (notably anxiety and late timing) are moderate rather than extreme, the overall profile is most consistent with sleep quality that is near the study sample average or modestly better than average.

Explicit comparison to the study sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16): synthesizing wearable and survey data, the participant’s sleep appears likely to fall near or slightly below (i.e., marginally better than) the population mean PSQI rather than substantially above it. That is, available evidence suggests their PSQI would likely be close to the sample mean but trending modestly toward better sleep quality, with the caveat that elevated trait anxiety and late sleep timing could produce subjective complaints not fully captured by the wearable metrics."
33657,"Summary: The combined self-report and wearable data portray a mixed sleep profile. Objective sleep time is near-sufficient in duration, but circadian irregularity, delayed sleep timing, and some behavioral and affective signals point toward compromised subjective sleep quality. When weighing the available indicators, the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely somewhat worse than the study sample average — i.e., above the population mean PSQI (mean = 6.73).

Factors that point to relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): 
- Depressive symptom burden is notable (CES-D = 16; Z = 0.28), and this measure has a moderately strong positive correlation with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.49). Elevated depressive symptoms are a robust predictor of worse self-reported sleep quality and therefore increase the likelihood of a higher PSQI.  
- Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:42), which is commonly associated with difficulties initiating or consolidating sleep and with poorer subjective sleep. The participant also naps more than typical for the sample (mean daily naps ≈ 0.26; Z = 2.23), and nap frequency shows a small positive correlation with PSQI; increased napping can reflect and/or maintain daytime sleepiness and fragmented nighttime sleep.  
- Circadian rhythm measures indicate reduced day-to-day regularity and greater within-day fragmentation: interdaily stability is relatively low (0.35; Z = −0.49) while intradaily variability is elevated (0.65; Z = 0.74). Elevated intradaily variability (rhythm fragmentation) is conceptually and empirically linked to poorer sleep quality and may contribute to subjective complaints even when total sleep time is adequate.  
- Behavioral context includes relatively high recreational alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2× weekly; Z ≈ 1), and an unusually high amount of time in a “sedentary hobby” (Z = 3.19). Both factors can reduce sleep drive or fragment sleep; although their sample-level correlations with PSQI are small, their presence supports risk for worse subjective sleep.  

Factors that point to relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI):
- Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 5 minutes (Z = −0.13), near the sample average and within commonly recommended ranges; variability of sleep duration across nights is lower than average (SD ≈ 63 minutes; Z = −0.85), which typically supports more restorative sleep. These objective duration metrics argue against severe insomnia-related short sleep.  
- Physiological signs of nocturnal rest are present: hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir (substantial negative deviations overnight) and a pronounced daytime rise, indicating intact nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (51.2 bpm; Z = −0.83), which commonly reflects good cardiovascular fitness and is not itself a marker of poor sleep.  
- Self-report mood and stress indicators are mixed-to-favorable on some domains: trait anxiety is low (STAI = 37; Z = −0.43), perceived stress is not elevated (PSS score = 20; Z ≈ −0.44), and current self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.55 and 0.22, respectively). These protective psychosocial features reduce some likelihood of severely impaired subjective sleep.

Circadian and physiological synthesis: Cosinor-derived circadian metrics show a relatively low mesor (63.24 bpm; Z = −1.46) and reduced amplitude (7.12; Z = −1.18) with acrophase in mid-afternoon (~3:16 PM). Low amplitude and mesor indicate a blunted circadian signal in heart rate across the recording period, and combined with elevated intradaily variability and lower interdaily stability, this pattern points to a rhythm that is less robust and more fragmented than typical. Fragmentation and irregular timing are more consistently associated with worse subjective sleep than small differences in overall heart-rate level, so the circadian profile supports a risk of elevated PSQI despite normal total sleep time.

Overall interpretation and comparison to the sample mean: Taken together, objective sleep duration and nocturnal heart-rate dips are relatively normal and argue against severe objective sleep restriction; however, the combination of late sleep timing, elevated nap frequency, circadian irregularity/fragmentation, higher depressive symptoms, and some lifestyle features (frequent sedentary hobby time; weekly alcohol use) provides convergent evidence for impaired subjective sleep quality. Therefore the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being above the study population mean PSQI (worse than average), although not extreme on most single metrics. This profile suggests moderately elevated PSQI relative to the sample mean (6.73), driven more by timing, regularity, and affective factors than by marked short sleep duration."
36117,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian patterns: Wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 39 minutes and essentially no daytime napping. Sleep onset is late on average (median start time ~01:13 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈100 minutes) and in duration (SD ≈93 minutes). Circadian summary metrics derived from heart rate show a relatively robust and regular 24-hour structure: interdaily stability is elevated (value 0.55, Z = 1.16), autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (Z = 1.23), intradaily variability is low (Z = −1.94), and cosinor-derived amplitude and mesor are higher than the study mean (amplitude Z = 1.58; mesor Z = 2.04). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between about 3:00–6:00 AM), and resting heart rate is higher than average for the sample (72 bpm; Z = 1.65). Together these objective signals point to preserved circadian amplitude and a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline despite a relatively elevated baseline heart rate.

Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several features in the profile are associated with indicators of more disturbed sleep in prior work and in correlations within the sample. The participant’s average sleep start time is late (post-midnight), which commonly associates with shorter sleep opportunity relative to conventional schedules and with subjective sleep complaints; the start-time variability (≈100 minutes) also indicates some inconsistency in sleep timing that can degrade sleep quality. Resting heart rate and mesor are markedly elevated relative to the cohort (RHR Z = 1.65; mesor Z = 2.04), which can reflect increased physiological arousal or poorer cardiovascular recovery and shows a small positive correlation with PSQI within the sample. Self-reported depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28) are at a level that meets a conventional screening threshold and have a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in the cohort (r ≈ 0.49), suggesting affective symptoms that commonly co-occur with worse subjective sleep. High evening/late-night leisure (internet use >4 hours; socializing and sedentary hobby time very high) may also contribute to delayed timing and pre-sleep arousal; some of these behaviors show small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample.

Evidence consistent with better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Counterbalancing the above, objective metrics indicate several features typically associated with healthier sleep. Median total sleep time is substantial (≈7 h 39 min) and above the population average for many student samples, and daytime napping is essentially absent—both favorable for consolidated nocturnal sleep. Circadian regularity measures are consistent with a stable daily rhythm (high interdaily stability, high 24-hour autocorrelation, low intradaily variability), and nocturnal heart-rate reductions are robust in magnitude; these signatures generally associate with more consolidated, restorative nocturnal physiology and show, within the sample, weak negative or negligible correlations with PSQI. The participant’s reported levels of social engagement, trust, and current happiness are relatively high and self-esteem is elevated (Z ≈ 0.96), and these positive psychosocial features tend to associate with better subjective sleep in population studies.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Weighing the objective and self-report evidence together, the profile reflects a mixed picture. Protective features—adequate median sleep duration, minimal napping, low intradaily variability, and strong interdaily stability—support reasonably good sleep continuity and circadian regularity. Risk features—late average sleep timing with some night-to-night variability, elevated resting heart rate/mesor, and the presence of depressive symptoms—point toward factors that could elevate subjective sleep disturbance. Given the strength of the objective circadian regularity and the objectively adequate sleep duration alongside the more moderate severity of the risk features, the balance of evidence suggests that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely near or modestly better than the study sample mean rather than substantially worse. Stated relative to the sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the data are most consistent with a PSQI near the population mean or slightly below it (i.e., slightly better sleep quality than the sample average), although the presence of depressive symptoms and elevated resting heart rate introduce meaningful risk for higher subjective sleep disturbance.

Uncertainties and caveats: This inference integrates cross-sectional survey items and aggregated wearable summaries; causal direction cannot be established and some measures (e.g., self-report CES-D threshold, RHR elevation) could reflect transient stressors or fitness differences rather than chronic sleep pathology. The late timing of sleep onset may produce subjective dissatisfaction or impairment not fully captured by duration and circadian regularity metrics; conversely, strong regularity and adequate duration may buffer subjective sleep complaints. These ambiguities mean the participant’s true PSQI could plausibly be modestly higher or lower than the inference above, and direct PSQI measurement would be required for confirmation."
92515,"Overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of behavioral patterns—markedly late and relatively short nightly sleep episodes on wearable records—coexisting with generally favorable self-reported mood, low symptom burden, and reasonably stable circadian structure in heart-rate rhythms. Objective sleep behavior (wearable) is the most direct predictor of increased global PSQI in this case (short duration, late and somewhat variable bedtimes), while subjective and physiological indicators (low depressive/anxiety scores, low resting heart rate, moderate interdaily stability) provide countervailing evidence consistent with aspects of good sleep health or resilience. Below I summarize evidence that would tend to indicate poorer versus better sleep quality and then provide an integrative judgment relative to the study sample mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73).

Evidence suggesting relatively poor sleep quality (predictors of higher PSQI)
- Short nightly sleep: the wearable median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 55 minutes (Z = -1.58 relative to the study sample), well below typical recommendations and a robust behavioral predictor of worse subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. 
- Very late sleep timing: median sleep start time is ~02:57 AM, which is substantially delayed relative to conventional night schedules and is associated with later circadian phase and greater risk of sleep complaints. 
- Timing variability: sleep start time standard deviation ≈ 110 minutes (Z = 0.59) and a sleep-duration SD of 94 minutes indicate notable night‑to‑night variability in timing and amount, which is associated with poorer sleep consolidation and higher PSQI scores in population studies.
- Circadian amplitude and sleep continuity signals: cosinor amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude = 9.67, Z = -0.36), which can reflect blunted day–night differences in autonomic arousal and has been associated with fragmented or lower-quality sleep in some work. 
- Temporal heart-rate deviations around typical sleep hours show large negative departures from the mesor during early morning hours (3–6 AM), consistent with consolidated sleep at those hours but, given the late sleep onset, may reflect truncated sleep opportunity (i.e., sleep that ends early relative to circadian nadir or social obligations), which can degrade subjective sleep quality.

Evidence suggesting relatively good sleep quality (predictors of lower PSQI)
- Low mood and stress indicators: CES-D = 4 (Z = -0.97, “not depressed”), STAI trait = 36 (Z = -0.52, “not anxious”), and Perceived Stress = 19 (Z = -0.71) are all at or below sample averages; lower affective symptoms are consistently associated with better subjective sleep reports and lower PSQI scores.
- Positive subjective wellbeing and social factors: self‑reported happiness is elevated (score 5.0, Z = 1.64) and self-esteem is above average (Z = 0.4), both of which tend to protect against complaints about sleep. Trust and health satisfaction are not elevated but are not showing signals that would increase PSQI risk.
- Circadian regularity and daily structure: interdaily stability is slightly above average (value = 0.42, Z = 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (value = 0.41, Z = 0.73). These metrics indicate that heart-rate–based daily patterns are reasonably consistent from day to day (a structured rhythm), which is generally supportive of sleep health and lower subjective sleep disturbance.
- Low restorative physiology burden: resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, Z = -0.26), which can indicate good cardiovascular fitness and lower physiological arousal that would be compatible with restorative sleep. Napping is minimal (mean daily naps = 0.07), so daytime napping is unlikely to be a major contributor to nighttime sleep disruption.

Integrative interpretation and comparison to the sample mean PSQI
Balancing these signals, the strongest and most direct indicators in the wearable record point toward decreased sleep opportunity and irregular timing (short median sleep ~5:55; very late median sleep onset ~02:57; elevated night-to-night variability), which are reliable drivers of higher global PSQI scores. The participant’s favorable affective profile (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, relatively high happiness and self‑esteem), stable day-to-day heart-rate rhythm, low resting heart rate, and minimal napping reduce the likelihood that subjective sleep complaints will be as severe as the objective sleep restriction might predict, but they do not fully offset the behavioral impact of chronically short and late sleep. Taking the pattern as a whole, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with a level above the study population mean PSQI (i.e., worse sleep than average). In other words, given the combination of very short sleep duration and late, variable bedtimes alongside otherwise favorable psychological indicators, the net signal suggests a PSQI score that would likely fall above the sample mean of 6.73.

Notes and caveats
- Correlation coefficients in the dataset between individual measures and PSQI are generally small-to-moderate and should not be overinterpreted for single-case inference; the wearable sleep-duration and timing metrics are the most behaviorally proximate predictors of PSQI here. 
- The presence of good mood and low symptom scores suggests that any subjective sleep disturbance might be experienced with less affective distress, but objective deficits in sleep opportunity (duration/timing) remain the dominant concern for sleep health and daytime functioning."
49790,"Summary overview: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mixture of objective signs of adequate nightly sleep duration alongside behavioral and physiological features that are commonly associated with compromised sleep quality. Wearable-derived sleep duration is relatively long (median 8 hours 4 minutes; Z = +1.10) and naps are absent (mean daily naps = 0.0; Z = -0.86). At the same time the participant has a very late typical sleep onset (median sleep start 02:18 AM) and large night-to-night variability in bedtime (sleep start SD = 169 minutes; Z = +1.89). Circadian rhythm metrics show low day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.25; Z = -1.32; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.14; Z = -1.54) together with a reduced amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm (amplitude = 7.79; Z = -0.97). Resting and overall heart-rate levels are elevated (resting HR = 75.7 bpm, Z = +2.09; mesor = 88.8, Z = +2.03). I consider these elements jointly when weighing likely contributors to a higher versus lower PSQI score.

Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The participant’s late and irregular sleep timing is a salient risk factor for worse subjective sleep quality. A habitual sleep onset near 2:20 AM and a large SD of sleep start times (169 minutes, Z ≈ +1.9) indicate circadian and behavioral irregularity that often maps onto difficulties initiating or consolidating sleep and daytime dysfunction. Objective circadian metrics corroborate low regularity: interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are both low (Z ≈ -1.3 and -1.5), suggesting weak day-to-day rhythmic structure. Physiologically, the participant shows elevated baseline cardiovascular activity (resting HR and mesor both ≈ +2 SD above the study mean) and a reduced amplitude of the diurnal heart-rate cycle; elevated resting HR and blunted amplitude can reflect higher nocturnal arousal, lower cardiovascular fitness, or stress-related activation, all of which are associated with poorer sleep. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (0.57; Z = +0.17), and several nighttime hourly heart-rate deviations are correlated modestly with PSQI in the sample (highest hourly correlations ~0.20–0.23 around 2–4 AM), which is consistent with fragmented or physiologically aroused sleep periods.

Evidence consistent with better sleep quality (lower PSQI): The participant reports very low depressive and trait-anxiety symptom scores (CES-D = 3, Z ≈ -1.07; STAI‑Trait = 27, Z ≈ -1.41), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in this sample (CES-D correlation ≈ 0.50; STAI ≈ 0.40), so these low scores suggest lower risk for poor subjective sleep. Self-reported health satisfaction and trust are above the sample mean (health satisfaction Z ≈ +1.22; trust Z ≈ +1.47), and self-esteem is also elevated (Z ≈ +1.10); these psychosocial resources are associated with better sleep in the cohort (negative correlations with PSQI). Objectively, the participant obtains a longer-than-average nightly duration (median ~8 h), and naps are essentially absent—both factors that, in isolation, commonly relate to adequate sleep quantity and lower daytime sleepiness.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing these observations, the profile indicates adequate total sleep time but pronounced circadian irregularity, late timing, and elevated physiological arousal. Because subjective sleep quality (PSQI) in this cohort is sensitive both to mood/anxiety and to circadian/physiological disturbance, the participant’s low depression and anxiety scores reduce the likelihood of very poor PSQI, while the large bedtime variability, late timing, low interdaily stability, and high resting HR increase it. On balance, this pattern most closely maps to a PSQI level that is at or modestly above the study population mean. Stated explicitly: the participant’s inferred overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI of 6.72 (i.e., somewhat worse than the sample average), driven primarily by late/irregular sleep timing and elevated resting heart rate despite otherwise low affective symptom burden and adequate sleep duration.

Notes and caveats: Correlations provided in the dataset are modest and do not determine causation; wearable-derived duration does not capture sleep fragmentation or subjective sleep complaints captured by the PSQI subscales. The elevated resting HR and reduced circadian amplitude are objective signals that merit consideration alongside behavior (bedtimes, variability) when interpreting subjective sleep quality."
78657,"Summary of major behavioral and physiological patterns: Wearable data indicate a pattern of delayed and irregular sleep timing, with a median sleep onset near 03:38 AM and substantial night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 123 minutes, z = 0.88). Median nightly sleep duration (6 h 30 m) is below 7 hours (z = -0.85), and the participant records essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, z = -0.86). Circadian metrics show reduced day-to-day rhythm stability (interdaily stability = 0.31, z = -0.82), elevated within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.67, z = 0.88), and a relatively late acrophase for heart rate (≈ 6:50 PM). Hourly heart-rate deviations reveal modestly elevated cardiovascular activity in late evening/early night hours (e.g., +5 bpm at 12–1am, +3.4 bpm at 1–2am; z-scores for those hours are relatively high) followed by the expected deepening trough across the early morning — a pattern consistent with later evening physiological activation and sleep occurring during a circadian phase that is shifted later than typical.

Evidence consistent with higher (worse) PSQI scores: Several wearable-derived indicators that are associated with poorer subjective sleep quality converge for this individual. Sleep timing is markedly delayed (median start ≈ 03:38) and highly variable across nights (start-time SD high, z = 0.88), both features that tend to predict worse PSQI in the literature and in the study correlations (sleep start variability correlates positively with PSQI, r ≈ 0.18). Median sleep duration is below the recommended duration (6.5 h, z = -0.85), which is a common contributor to higher PSQI. Circadian regularity metrics also point toward risk: lowered interdaily stability (z = -0.82) and elevated intradaily variability (z = 0.88) indicate an irregular daily structure; such irregularity is commonly linked to worse subjective sleep and daytime impairment. Physiologically, the presence of relatively high evening heart-rate deviations and a late acrophase suggest elevated evening arousal or activity timing that could interfere with sleep consolidation and perceived sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with lower (better) PSQI scores: Several psychological and behavioral factors that typically protect against poor subjective sleep are present. Self-report measures show relatively low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, z = -0.14) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 38, z = -0.33); CES-D has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.49), so lower depressive symptom burden is a meaningful protective factor. Perceived stress is comparatively low (PSS = 17, z = -1.26), and resting heart rate is relatively low (53.4 bpm, z = -0.56), which can reflect higher cardiovascular fitness and is sometimes associated with better sleep. The participant reports regular physical activity (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; exercise z-scores > 1), a habitual behavior that is generally associated with improved sleep quality. There are also low levels of daytime napping, which reduces the likelihood of midday sleep fragmentation contributing to poorer nighttime sleep.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the strongest signals point toward sleep difficulty driven by late and irregular sleep timing and insufficient sleep duration — factors with direct mechanistic links to worse subjective sleep. Protective psychological and lifestyle features (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, low perceived stress, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, and little napping) mitigate some risk but do not fully offset the likely effects of chronically delayed and unstable sleep timing. Given the pattern and relative magnitudes of these indicators, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI score that is above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). In other words, the combined multimodal evidence suggests this participant is likely to report somewhat poorer sleep than the average person in the sample, driven primarily by late sleep timing and schedule irregularity rather than by mood symptoms or lack of physical fitness.

Implications for interpretation: The data suggest the principal drivers of elevated subjective sleep disturbance would be circadian timing and schedule irregularity rather than affective symptoms. Wearable heart-rate timing and high sleep-start variability are the most salient objective signals supporting that conclusion. These results should be interpreted as probabilistic indicators of sleep quality relative to the cohort mean rather than as a clinical diagnosis."
48154,"Summary of key behavioral and physiological observations: Wearable-recorded sleep duration is relatively long and consistent for this participant (median sleep = 8 h 3 min, Z = +1.08; sleep duration SD = 64 min, Z = -0.85). The participant generally does not nap (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Sleep onset is late on average (median sleep start ~01:03 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD = 72 min, Z ≈ -0.24). Circadian measures from heart rate indicate a relatively weak and blunted rhythm overall (interdaily stability = 0.26, Z = -1.23; amplitude Z = -0.71), and the cosinor MESOR is somewhat low (Z = -0.78). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (large negative deviations between ~1:00–7:00 AM) with elevated cardiovascular activity in the late afternoon/early evening (notably 5–6 PM, Z = +1.13). Self-report psychological and lifestyle measures favor good sleep-related functioning: low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07), low trait anxiety (STAI = 30, Z = -1.12), relatively high self-esteem and happiness (RSES Z = +1.66; happiness Z = +1.64), regular exercise (≥3x/week, Z = +1.07), low nap use, and no use of non-prescribed drugs.

Factors suggesting greater likelihood of poor sleep (higher PSQI): The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median start ~1:00 AM), which can contribute to evening-to-morning misalignment with daytime obligations and to subjective sleep complaints even when total sleep time is long. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced day-to-day regularity and a blunted amplitude (interdaily stability Z = -1.23; amplitude Z = -0.71), a pattern that is often associated with worse sleep quality and fragmentation. The intradaily variability is slightly above the sample mean (Z ≈ +0.10), consistent with some within-day fragmentation of physiological rhythms. Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (peak at 5–6 PM) may reflect later-day physiological arousal that can delay sleep onset. Modest alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2x/week) and multi-hour internet use (2–3 hours daily) could also contribute to later bedtimes or lowered sleep quality in susceptible individuals, though their correlations with PSQI in this sample are small.

Factors suggesting greater likelihood of good sleep (lower PSQI): The participant obtains relatively long nightly sleep with low variability in duration (median 8 h 3 min, Z = +1.08; duration SD Z = -0.85), which typically corresponds to fewer sleep complaints and better subjective sleep quality. They report no daytime naps, engage in regular exercise (which is associated with improved sleep), and show favorable mental-health indicators—very low depressive and anxiety scores and high self-esteem and happiness—which have moderate associations with better sleep in this cohort (CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI are both positive). Resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, Z = -0.26), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and generally associated with healthier sleep physiology. Sleep start time variability is only modest (SD Z ≈ -0.24), suggesting some stability in when sleep begins night-to-night despite the late average hour.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean PSQI: Balancing the evidence, the strongest protective signals are long and fairly stable sleep duration, absence of naps, frequent exercise, and robustly low depressive and anxiety symptoms—factors that, in this sample, are meaningfully associated with lower PSQI scores. The primary risk signals are the late habitual sleep onset and weakened circadian regularity (low interdaily stability and reduced amplitude), which elevate the chance of poorer subjective sleep or daytime impairment for some individuals. On balance, given the combination of substantial protective psychosocial and sleep-quantity indicators and only moderate circadian/timing risks, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being below the population mean PSQI (i.e., reporting better sleep than average in this sample). However, the late timing and blunted circadian regularity represent notable targets for behavioral modification if subjective sleep problems emerge or daytime functioning is affected."
21793,"Summary: The dataset presents a mixed but overall concerning picture for sleep quality. Behavioral and self-report indicators include elevated perceived stress (PSS = 27; Z = +1.47), modest trait anxiety (STAI = 43; Z = +0.17) and lower self-rated happiness and trust; these psychological factors associate positively with PSQI in the sample. Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a short median nightly sleep duration (6 h 9 min; Z = -1.29), a very late median sleep start time (03:36:45), substantial night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD = 130 minutes; Z = +1.04) and minutes of daily napping above the sample (mean naps = 0.33/day; Z = +3.05). Taken together, these features point toward circadian misalignment and fragmented sleep opportunity that are commonly linked with worse global sleep quality.

Factors consistent with relatively poorer sleep (higher PSQI): Several strong signals align with higher PSQI scores. The participant’s short median sleep duration (Z ≈ -1.3) and large variability in both sleep timing and duration are risk factors for perceived poor sleep (sleep duration SD correlation with PSQI = 0.20; sleep start SD correlation = 0.17). Frequent daytime napping (Z = +3.05) further correlates positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.16) and may reflect compensatory behavior for insufficient nocturnal sleep. Elevated perceived stress (Z = +1.47) and modestly elevated depressive/anxious symptom scores (CES-D = 15, STAI = 43), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), further support a constellation of psychological strain that commonly co-occurs with worse subjective sleep. Finally, daily recreation and media use patterns (e.g., relatively high evening music and TV/video use) may contribute to late bedtimes and pre-sleep arousal.

Physiological and circadian rhythm evidence also points toward disrupted sleep timing and arousal. Interdaily stability is low (0.17; Z = -1.98) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.15; Z = -1.45), indicating weak day-to-day regularity of the heart rate rhythm; intradaily variability is moderately elevated (0.68; Z = +0.95), consistent with frequent within-day transitions and lower rhythm consolidation. Cosinor amplitude is reduced (6.5; Z = -1.38) and mesor is below the sample mean (65.7 bpm; Z = -1.13), suggesting a relatively blunted 24-hour heart rate rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations show higher-than-mesor heart rate in the late-night window around midnight–2 AM (12–2 AM positive deviations) followed by a steep drop in early morning hours (3–7 AM strongly negative deviations). That pattern is compatible with delayed/late-night physiological arousal followed by a pronounced nocturnal nadir—an arrangement that is consistent with the participant’s very late median sleep start and may reflect delayed sleep timing and pre-sleep restlessness. Several of these night-hour deviations (e.g., 2–4 AM) show small positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (r up to ~0.22), reinforcing their relevance to subjective sleep quality.

Factors consistent with relatively better sleep (lower PSQI): There are a few protective features. The participant has a relatively low resting heart rate (54.2 bpm; Z = -0.47) and low overall mesor, which can reflect cardiovascular fitness or lower nocturnal physiological stress; these metrics have only small correlations with PSQI in the sample but are not indicators of poor sleep here. Substance use is minimal (alcohol use 1–2 times/month; no recreational or non-prescribed drug use), and exercise occurs at least occasionally (exercising alone 1–2 times/week), behaviors that generally support sleep health and are not prominent contributors to poor sleep for this person. Self-reported satisfaction with physical health is modestly positive (4.67 on 1–7; Z = +0.3).

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward disrupted and insufficient nocturnal sleep—late and irregular sleep timing, short median sleep duration, frequent napping, elevated perceived stress, and physiologic signs of late-night arousal and weak circadian stability. These features are more closely aligned with higher PSQI scores in the study sample. Relative to the study population mean PSQI (mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with an overall sleep quality level above the population mean (i.e., worse than average). The few protective signs (low resting HR, limited substance use, occasional exercise) do not outweigh the multiple indicators of circadian irregularity and sleep restriction."
37218,"Summary and overall inference:
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a constellation of features that, taken together, indicate sleep quality that is likely poorer than the study sample average. The participant’s median sleep onset is very late (03:56:30) and median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 1 m; Z = -1.45), while several psychological symptom scores that correlate positively with PSQI (CES-D = 24, Z = 1.11; STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) are elevated. Considering these multimodal signals and their known associations with PSQI in this sample, the participant’s overall sleep quality is best described as above the population mean PSQI (i.e., worse sleep than average; sample mean PSQI = 6.71).

Evidence pointing toward higher PSQI (worse sleep):
- Very late habitual sleep timing: the median sleep start at ~03:56 is an extreme delay relative to typical college schedules and is a strong behavioral contributor to reduced sleep opportunity and circadian misalignment, both of which are commonly associated with higher PSQI.  
- Short sleep duration and some variability: median duration of ~6 hours and a sleep-duration SD of ~91 minutes indicate restricted and somewhat inconsistent sleep opportunity (duration Z = -1.45), a pattern that tends to raise PSQI.  
- Elevated mood and anxiety symptoms: the CES-D score of 24 (Z = 1.11) and trait anxiety score of 49 (Z = 0.76) are both above average in the sample and have moderate positive correlations with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40, respectively), implying these psychological symptoms likely contribute substantially to poorer subjective sleep quality.  
- Low exercise engagement and high evening leisure: the participant reports little or no regular exercise (Z-scores strongly negative) and relatively high evening leisure (listening to music >4 hours, Z = 2.06; TV 1–2 hours, Z = 1.28). Low daytime activity and prolonged evening stimulation can both be associated with poorer sleep initiation and maintenance.  
- Physiological evening/night arousal and reduced circadian amplitude: aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively elevated cardiovascular activity in late evening and around midnight (e.g., 9–11 pm and 12–1 am positive deviations) and the cosinor amplitude is lower than average (amplitude = 8.83, Z = -0.63). Elevated evening arousal plus a blunted circadian amplitude are consistent with greater difficulty falling/staying asleep and are modestly linked to higher PSQI in this dataset.

Evidence pointing toward lower PSQI (better sleep):
- Low reported substance use and few naps: the participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use (Z-scores broadly negative) and essentially no daily naps (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). These behaviors reduce common contributors to sleep fragmentation and subjective poor sleep.  
- Reasonable circadian regularity: interdaily stability is above average (0.48, Z = 0.58) and intradaily variability is near the sample mean (0.55, Z ~ 0.03). These metrics suggest the participant’s daily heart-rate rhythm is relatively consistent across days, which can be protective for sleep consolidation despite the shifted timing.  
- Lower perceived stress: the PSS score is comparatively low (14, Z = -2.07), which—other things equal—would be expected to reduce sleep-disrupting cognitive arousal; however, the correlation between PSS and PSQI in this sample is modest (r ≈ 0.21), so the protective effect may be limited.

Integrated interpretation and caveats:
The dominant pattern is one of delayed sleep timing and compressed sleep opportunity combined with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and signs of physiological evening arousal; these factors converge to indicate a higher-than-average PSQI score for this participant (i.e., sleep quality worse than the sample mean of 6.71). Countervailing protective elements (no substance use, stable day-to-day rhythms, low reported stress, and no daytime napping) mitigate some risk but do not appear sufficient to offset the likely impact of late sleep timing and internalizing symptoms. Several objective circadian indicators point to a stable but phase-delayed rhythm (moderate interdaily stability, late acrophase at ~6:29 PM, low amplitude), which aligns with the observed late sleep onset and may explain persistent sleep restriction. Limitations include that hourly heart-rate values are aggregated across days (preventing day-level causal inference) and that some correlations with PSQI in the dataset are relatively small; thus, while the balance of evidence supports a conclusion of poorer-than-average sleep, the exact magnitude of PSQI elevation cannot be determined precisely from the provided inputs.

Areas to prioritize based on this profile:
If the analytic goal is to identify modifiable contributors, the most salient targets suggested by the data are (a) shifting sleep timing earlier (to increase sleep opportunity and reduce circadian misalignment), (b) reducing evening physiological/cognitive arousal (given elevated late-evening heart-rate deviations), and (c) addressing elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms that are moderately correlated with worse PSQI in this sample. These are offered as interpretation of the data rather than prescriptive recommendations."
17932,"Objective wearable data and sleep timing show a pattern of long, consolidated nocturnal sleep with a stable circadian structure. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 35 minutes (Z = +1.74 relative to the study sample), with a relatively low night-to-night variability in start time (SD 53 minutes, Z = -0.66) and in duration (SD 94 minutes, Z = -0.16). Nights are not offset by naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Heart-rate–based circadian metrics further support a regular rhythm: interdaily stability is elevated (0.54, Z = +1.08) and intradaily variability is low (0.37, Z = -1.24), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (0.52, Z = +1.65). Nocturnal heart-rate deviations show a large and consistent night-time reduction (hourly deviations down ~-18 to -25 bpm between ~2:00–8:00 AM), and resting heart rate and mesor are low (resting HR = 48.7 bpm, Z = -1.13; mesor = 66.6 bpm, Z = -1.01). Together these objective indicators (long sleep duration, low fragmentation, strong night-time autonomic downregulation, and stable day-to-day timing) point toward physiological and behavioral patterns that tend to be associated with lower (better) PSQI scores.

Self-reported trait and behavioral measures largely align with a lower risk of poor sleep. Depressive and trait-anxiety symptom scores are below the study mean (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14; STAI-Trait = 35, Z = -0.62), perceived stress is lower than average (PSS = 18, Z = -0.98), and self-rated health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = +0.97). Regular exercise is reported (exercising alone three times a week or more, Z = +1.07), and recreational drug use is absent. These psychological and lifestyle indicators are typically associated with better sleep quality; several of these measures have meaningful correlations with PSQI in the sample (for example, CES-D correlation with PSQI ≈ +0.50 and STAI ≈ +0.41), and in this participant the scores on those scales are not elevated.

Factors that could plausibly push PSQI upward (worse sleep) are present but modest. The participant’s habitual sleep start time is late (median start ≈ 01:23 AM), which can be associated with components of poor subjective sleep (e.g., sleep latency or daytime dysfunction) even when total sleep time is adequate. Alcohol consumption at the level of 1–2 times per week (beer and wine/liquor both reported) may affect sleep continuity or sleep architecture on consumption nights. Daily video-game time is elevated (1–2 hours; Z ≈ +2.47) and could reflect evening screen exposure or arousing late-night behavior for some individuals; however, the study correlations between these particular behaviors and PSQI are small in this sample. Finally, some self-report items (current happiness and interpersonal trust) are modestly below the sample mean, which could interact with sleep quality for some people, although corresponding symptom scores (depression/anxiety) are not elevated here.

Balancing the evidence, the strongest drivers in this multimodal profile are the objective indicators of long, regular, and physiologically restorative nocturnal sleep (high median duration, low intradaily variability, marked nocturnal heart-rate decline, low resting HR) together with low-to-moderate psychological symptom burden and regular exercise. These features carry more direct relevance and stronger measurement consistency with sleep quality than the more limited risk features (late bedtime, moderate alcohol use, recreational screen time). Given the available data and the direction/magnitude of key Z-scores, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being below the study sample’s mean PSQI (i.e., better sleep than the average participant). For context, the study mean PSQI is 6.71 (SD = 2.14); the pattern of objective sleep regularity and long duration in this case argues that their PSQI is likely lower than that group mean rather than above it.

Uncertainty and caveats: several associations between wearable metrics and PSQI are small in this sample, and subjective experience can diverge from physiological measures. The late habitual sleep onset could produce higher subjective sleep disturbance or daytime impairment for this individual despite objectively long sleep, so a definitive PSQI estimate would benefit from the participant’s actual PSQI score or additional self-report on sleep quality components (latency, disturbances, daytime dysfunction)."
81420,"Objective wearable sleep measures indicate a largely adequate total sleep duration but a markedly delayed and variable sleep timing. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 12 minutes (Z = 0.02), which is essentially at the study mean for duration, and mean daily naps were minimal (0.07 naps/day, Z = -0.02). However, the median sleep start time was very late (02:40:30) with a standard deviation of 93 minutes (Z = 0.22), indicating recurrent late bedtimes with moderate night-to-night variability. Nighttime heart rate deviations show modest elevation around midnight (12–1am: +4.11 bpm, Z = 0.85) followed by progressively larger nocturnal declines through the early morning (largest negative deviations ~6–7am, ~-14.8 bpm), consistent with a delayed sleep period but preserved nocturnal heart rate reduction once asleep.

Physiological circadian metrics point to reduced rhythm robustness. Interdaily stability was low (0.29, Z = -0.99) and amplitude from cosinor analysis was below the cohort mean (8.49, Z = -0.74), while mesor and resting heart rate were modestly elevated (mesor 78.34 bpm, Z = 0.6; resting HR 62.6 bpm, Z = 0.53). Lower interdaily stability and amplitude typically reflect less consistent timing and reduced day–night contrast in cardiovascular activity; together with a later-than-average acrophase (5:52 PM) these features are compatible with circadian phase delay and blunted circadian amplitude, both of which are empirical correlates of poorer subjective sleep quality.

Psychological and behavioral survey indicators that favor higher (worse) PSQI scores are prominent. Depressive symptoms were elevated (CES-D = 25, Z = 1.22) and trait anxiety was above average (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86); both scores have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40). Self-esteem was relatively low (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01), which in this cohort negatively correlates with sleep quality (r = -0.35). Alcohol use of beer at 1–2 times per week (Z = 1.01) is higher than average and, while only weakly correlated with PSQI here, can contribute to sleep disruption. The combination of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, modestly increased resting heart rate/mesor, and circadian irregularity all point toward factors that tend to elevate PSQI scores.

Conversely, several features are consistent with comparatively preserved sleep quantity and some protective behaviors. The participant maintains a near-average total sleep time across the recording period (median 7h12m), reports minimal daytime napping, and engages in regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z = 1.07), a behavior that is weakly associated with better sleep in this sample. Daytime activities and limited recreational screen time also do not indicate excessive evening stimulant exposure. The intradaily variability value is unusually low (0.31, Z = -1.66); interpreted cautiously, this could reflect consolidated rest–activity patterns on many days rather than highly fragmented rest, which would tend to be favorable for sleep continuity.

Weighing the evidence, the data suggest a mixed profile but one that leans toward poorer subjective sleep quality relative to the study population. Although total sleep time and low napping argue for adequate sleep quantity, the combination of late and variable sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (which have relatively strong sample correlations with PSQI), and modestly raised resting/mean heart rates are features typically associated with higher PSQI scores. Therefore, compared to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72, this participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being above the population mean (i.e., worse than the average participant), despite preserved average sleep duration.

Limitations and caveats: this inference relies on cross-sectional associations and aggregated wearable metrics rather than direct PSQI reporting for this individual. Objective duration can mask subjective sleep problems (difficulty initiating, fragmented sleep, nonrestorative sleep) that are more strongly tied to the elevated mood symptoms observed here. If the goal is clinical or interventional prioritization, the most actionable targets suggested by the profile are addressing late sleep timing and circadian regularity and evaluating mood/anxiety symptoms, as each has empirical links to improvements in sleep quality."
67709,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports substantial affective symptom burden that is relevant for sleep. Depressive symptoms are elevated (CES-D = 29, Z = +1.63) and trait anxiety is above average (STAI = 46, Z = +0.46); both scales show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (r ≈ 0.50 and r ≈ 0.40, respectively), indicating these symptoms are likely contributors to worse subjective sleep. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 26, Z = +1.19) and has a smaller positive association with PSQI (r ≈ 0.20). By contrast, self-reported happiness is modestly above the sample mean (Z = +0.55) and substance use is minimal; exercise with others is relatively frequent (Z = +1.23). Those latter features are plausibly protective against poor sleep, but their PSQI correlations are small in magnitude. Overall, the psychological profile provides multiple moderately strong indicators that subjective sleep quality may be poorer than average.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a long median sleep duration (8 h 16 m, Z = +1.34) but very late sleep timing and substantial irregularity. Median sleep start time is ~03:45 AM and night-to-night sleep duration variability is large (SD ≈ 173 minutes, Z = +1.65); start-time variability is also elevated (SD ≈ 98 minutes, Z = +0.33). In this sample, greater night-to-night variability in sleep duration and more irregular sleep timing are positively associated with PSQI (r ≈ 0.18–0.20), meaning such instability tends to co-occur with poorer sleep quality. The combination of long average sleep duration with very late and inconsistent sleep timing suggests delayed and irregular sleep schedules that may undermine sleep continuity or subjective sleep quality despite adequate total sleep time.

Circadian and heart-rate derived signals: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics show a modestly blunted mesor (MESOR ≈ 67.9 bpm, Z = −0.83) and a moderate amplitude (Z = +0.27); interdaily stability and intradaily variability are near or below the study mean (interdaily stability Z = −0.24; intradaily variability Z = −0.60), suggesting that heart-rate rhythms are present but not highly stable day to day. The acrophase is in the early evening (~6:15 PM), and hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations reveal a pronounced evening/early-evening peak (large positive deviation around 5–6 PM, Z = +2.76) and elevated late-evening heart rate (10–11 PM positive deviation, Z ≈ +1.09). Elevated evening autonomic arousal and a relatively irregular 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = −1.12) can be consistent with evening activity/arousal and variable schedules; these features are plausibly linked to difficulties with sleep initiation or maintenance. Resting heart rate is relatively low (≈53 bpm, Z = −0.56), a feature that is more typically associated with favorable cardiovascular fitness and is not strongly associated with worse PSQI in this sample.

Factors pointing toward poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (strongest psychological correlates), high perceived stress, very late habitual sleep timing (~03:45 AM), large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ~173 minutes) and start time, elevated evening heart-rate/physiological arousal, and modest daytime napping (mean daily naps Z = +0.82). Several of these features—especially depressive symptoms and anxiety—have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample and therefore are the most salient evidence for a relatively high PSQI score.

Factors pointing toward better sleep quality (lower PSQI): Long median sleep duration (≈8 h 16 m), low resting heart rate, low substance use, relatively frequent social exercise, and some indications of circadian amplitude (notably non-zero amplitude) are features that tend to co-occur with better sleep or may protect against very poor sleep. However, the sample-level correlations for these protective features with PSQI are generally small, so their influence on subjective sleep quality is likely weaker than the depressive/anxiety/stability risks described above.

Holistic comparison to the study population: Weighing the evidence, the balance favors a PSQI score above the study population mean (population mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16). The presence of elevated depressive symptoms (strongest single correlate), above-average anxiety and stress, and marked irregularity and lateness of sleep timing are the dominant influences and align with patterns associated with higher PSQI in this sample. Protective factors (long total sleep time, low resting HR, low substance use, social exercise) mitigate some risk but do not fully counterbalance the larger, better-correlated indicators of poor sleep. In summary, the data most consistently support an inference of sleep quality that is worse than the sample average (i.e., above the population mean PSQI).

Notes on interpretation and limitations: This inference integrates cross-sectional self-report correlates and aggregated wearable summaries; causal direction cannot be established and some associations in the dataset are small in magnitude. The wearable hourly heart-rate deviations are temporally aggregated (not day-specific) and therefore inform typical daily arousal patterns rather than night-to-night dynamics. Subjective PSQI was not provided directly, so the conclusion is probabilistic and should be interpreted as an informed estimate rather than a definitive measurement."
36552,"Summary assessment: The multimodal data present a mixed but overall slightly adverse sleep profile. Wearable-recorded sleep duration is shorter than the study sample average (median 6 h 23 min; Z = -1.00) and sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:28). Objective circadian markers show reduced rhythm robustness (low amplitude 7.46, Z = -1.07; low interdaily stability 0.29, Z = -0.99) and elevated fragmentation of activity rhythms (intradaily variability 0.72, Z = 1.23). Concurrently, there is a relatively elevated resting heart rate (64.3 bpm, Z = 0.73) and a pronounced daytime autonomic peak (largest aggregate HR deviation 3–4 pm = +19.9 bpm, Z = 1.99; acrophase 4:02 pm). These features together point toward physiological and behavioral patterns commonly associated with poorer sleep quality and greater sleep disturbance.

Evidence consistent with higher (worse) PSQI: Short nightly sleep duration and late sleep timing are primary objective indicators associated with worse self-reported sleep; the participant’s median sleep is about an hour below typical 7+ hour recommendations and their bedtime around 1:30 AM is late relative to many college schedules. Reduced circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability indicate a less robust and less regular 24-hour cardiovascular rhythm, which is frequently linked to sleep complaints. Elevated intradaily variability (fragmentation) and a higher-than-average resting heart rate are additional physiological signals that often co-occur with sleep disturbance. On the self-report side, trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) and above-average perceived stress (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) are both correlated with poorer PSQI in the sample and therefore serve as psychosocial contributors to elevated PSQI risk.

Evidence consistent with lower (better) PSQI: There are several countervailing factors that point toward preserved aspects of sleep health. Night-to-night sleep variability is relatively low (sleep duration SD = 49 min, Z = -1.17; sleep start SD Z = -0.75), indicating consistent sleep schedules despite late timing, and mean daily naps are essentially zero (Z = -0.86), which reduces the likelihood of fragmented nighttime sleep from daytime napping. The participant reports frequent solo exercise (three times/week or more; Z = 1.07), low substance use, relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 40), and above-average health satisfaction (Z = 0.55) — all factors that, in the broader sample, are associated with better sleep or resilience against sleep disruption. Many of the correlations between objective circadian metrics and PSQI in this dataset are modest in magnitude, so some objective abnormalities may not translate directly into very high subjective sleep disturbance for this individual.

Integrated conclusion relative to the study sample: Taking objective and self-report evidence together, the profile is most consistent with modestly worse sleep than the sample average. In statistical terms, the participant’s pattern of shorter sleep duration, late bedtimes, reduced circadian amplitude and stability, and elevated intradaily variability support an inference of a PSQI score above the study population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72). However, the low night-to-night variability, absence of naps, regular exercise, and limited substance use temper this inference, suggesting the participant’s sleep disturbance is likely moderate rather than extreme. Uncertainty remains because several relevant correlations with PSQI in the sample are small; accordingly, the conclusion is that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean (i.e., somewhat poorer than average) but not at the extreme upper end of the PSQI distribution."
16654,"Factors in the data that are most consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality (i.e., contributors that would tend to increase PSQI score): the participant’s habitual sleep timing is late, with a median sleep start of approximately 01:37 AM. A late sleep midpoint and late sleep onset are commonly associated with sleep complaints and can increase subjective sleep disturbance even when duration is adequate. Wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively elevated cardiovascular activity in the late-evening window (roughly 9–12 PM; e.g., 9–10 PM deviation +14.4, Z = 1.11; 10–11 PM +13.4, Z = 1.10; 11–12 AM +12.3, Z = 1.32), which may reflect higher physiological arousal in the hours leading up to the participant’s bedtime and could interfere with sleep initiation or sleep quality. Alcohol use at a frequency of 1–2 times per week (beer and wine/liquor each Z ≈ 1.0) is another behavioral factor that can fragment sleep or reduce sleep continuity for some individuals. Finally, some small positive correlations between variability metrics and PSQI (e.g., sleep-duration SD correl. ≈ 0.20) indicate that any remaining irregularity in sleep could modestly worsen reported sleep quality.

Factors that are most consistent with relatively better sleep quality (i.e., contributors that would tend to lower PSQI score): objectively, the participant’s median nightly sleep duration is substantial—about 7 hours 46 minutes (Z = 0.73)—which is in the range typically associated with adequate restorative sleep. Night-to-night consistency is also strong: sleep duration SD = 55 minutes (Z = –1.04) and sleep-start-time SD = 30 minutes (Z = –1.17) indicate low intra-individual variability, and the participant reports essentially no napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = –0.86). Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show a well-structured rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.54, Z = 1.08; amplitude = 15.22, Z = 1.44), and the nocturnal heart-rate trough is pronounced (large negative deviations from mesor across 2–7 AM), both of which generally correspond to consolidated nighttime rest and lower sleep disturbance. Physiological markers such as a modestly low resting heart rate (59.7 bpm, Z = 0.18) and favorable self-report mental-health indicators (CES-D = 0.0, STAI–Trait = 34) further support lower risk of widespread sleep complaints. Social and activity patterns—frequent exercise with others (Z = 1.23) and several hours of socializing—also tend to correlate with better sleep regulation in young adults.

Holistic synthesis and relative placement versus the study population: weighing objective wearable signals, behavioral habits, and self-report together indicates that the participant demonstrates multiple robust markers of sound sleep physiology and regularity (sufficient median duration, low night-to-night variability, strong interdaily stability and amplitude, minimal napping). These features point to a relatively low PSQI score compared with the study sample. Countervailing risks—principally a late habitual bedtime (~01:37 AM) and elevated late-evening physiological activation with modest weekly alcohol use—could increase subjective sleep complaints for some individuals but do not outweigh the substantial objective indicators of consolidated sleep in this case. On balance, the data most strongly support that this participant’s overall sleep quality is below the study population mean PSQI (i.e., better than average sleep quality relative to the sample mean of 6.73)."
29134,"Summary — overall pattern:
The participant shows a mixed profile across self-report, wearable-derived circadian metrics, and sleep behavior. Objective wearable data record a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 40 minutes (Z = 0.60), a low resting heart rate (55.4 bpm, Z = -0.33), and generally preserved day–night differences in heart rate, but a reduced circadian amplitude (9.21, Z = -0.51). Psychological self-report measures indicate relatively low depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14; STAI = 38, Z = -0.33), moderately high happiness and health satisfaction (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.55), and frequent social/physical activity (sports and group exercise Z > 1). Several behavioral features are notable for variability: night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 159 minutes, Z = 1.33) and especially variability in sleep start time (SD = 183 minutes, Z = 2.20) are elevated.

Factors consistent with poorer sleep quality (predicting a higher PSQI):
The most salient risk indicators for worse sleep quality are the irregular sleep timing and variable sleep duration. The participant’s median sleep start is relatively late (about 01:13 AM) and night-to-night variability in sleep onset is very high (SD Z = 2.20); sleep duration variability is also elevated (SD Z = 1.33). Both variability measures have positive correlations with PSQI in the study data (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.16; sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.19), indicating that irregular schedules in this sample are associated with worse subjective sleep. The cosinor-derived circadian amplitude is lower than average (Z = -0.51), which—given its modest negative correlation with PSQI in the sample—can be interpreted as a weaker circadian signal that may reduce sleep consolidation for some individuals. Weekly alcohol use at 1–2 times per week (Z ≈ 1) and a late habitual bedtime can also contribute to fragmented or lower-quality sleep in real-world contexts, even if their sample correlations with PSQI are small.

Factors consistent with better sleep quality (predicting a lower PSQI):
Several indicators point toward relatively good sleep-related risk factors. Median sleep duration is above the sample average (7 h 40 m, Z = 0.60), and daytime napping is infrequent (mean naps 0.12/day, Z = 0.61 but low absolute value), both of which typically support better nocturnal sleep. Physiological markers and lifestyle factors consistent with better sleep include a relatively low resting heart rate (55.4 bpm, Z = -0.33), frequent physical activity (sports and exercising with others Z > 1), and low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D and STAI both below the study mean). Self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are above average (Z ≈ 0.55), and these positive psychosocial features have negative correlations with PSQI in the sample (e.g., self-esteem r ≈ -0.36), suggesting protective effects on subjective sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population:
Weighing the evidence, the participant presents a combination of protective factors (adequate median sleep duration, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, low mood/anxiety) and risk factors (notably large variability in sleep onset and duration and a late typical sleep start). Because variability in sleep timing is a strong behavioral determinant of perceived sleep problems while most psychosocial and physiological indicators align with better sleep, the net picture is mixed but leans toward overall sleep quality that is close to or modestly better than average for this sample. Compared with the study population mean PSQI of 6.71, the data are most consistent with an inferred PSQI near or slightly below the population mean (i.e., near the mean or modestly better sleep quality than average). This conclusion emphasizes that while overall sleep quantity and health-behavioral supports are favorable, reducing night-to-night variability in sleep timing would be the most direct behavioral target to potentially improve subjective sleep quality."
24029,"Summary overview: The participant’s data show a mixed profile in which substantial psychological distress and some markers of circadian/behavioral irregularity coexist with several protective health behaviors and physiological signs of fitness. Self-report measures are notable for elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 21, Z = 0.8), elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and very high perceived stress (PSS = 30, Z = 2.28). These three self-report scales have the largest positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.50, STAI r ≈ 0.40, PSS r ≈ 0.20), making them the most salient psychological predictors of poorer sleep quality in this profile. Physical health behaviors that typically protect sleep—regular exercise (exercising alone and with others three times/week or more), absence of alcohol/other substance use, and no daytime napping—are present and argue for some resilience in sleep-related behavior.

Evidence suggesting relatively poorer sleep (factors likely to raise PSQI): Psychological distress is the clearest contributor to predicted worse sleep—CES-D, STAI and PSS are substantially elevated relative to the study sample and these scales correlate positively with PSQI. Objective and circadian metrics provide additional indications of vulnerability: intradaily variability (0.70, Z = 1.09) is elevated, consistent with greater within-day fragmentation of heart-rate rhythms and less consolidated activity–rest structure, and sleep timing variability is moderate (sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes; duration SD ≈ 102 minutes). These variability measures have modest positive correlations with PSQI (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18), implying that irregular sleep timing and variable duration may contribute to worse subjective sleep. Median sleep duration (6 h 46 m, Z = -0.52) is below the sample mean, which can contribute to poorer sleep quality even though its direct correlation with PSQI is small. Behaviorally, relatively large time spent in sedentary hobbies, video games, and extended music listening (high Z-scores) may be associated with later or less restorative evening routines, potentially worsening sleep despite the lack of direct timing data.

Evidence suggesting relatively better sleep (factors likely to lower PSQI): Several objective and behavioral indicators favor better sleep. The participant reports no alcohol or drug use and no daily naps—behaviors that typically support nocturnal sleep consolidation. Exercise frequency is above average (Z ≈ 1.1–1.6 for exercise and sports), a well-established protective factor for sleep. Wearable physiology also shows features consistent with intact nocturnal down-regulation: the overnight aggregate heart-rate deviations show large negative departures from the mesor during the core night hours (e.g., around -20 to -24 BPM between midnight and 4 AM; several of these values have strongly negative Z-scores), indicating a robust nocturnal heart-rate decline. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42), which commonly reflects better cardiovascular fitness and is often associated with healthier sleep physiology. Interdaily stability (0.42, Z = 0.09) and cosinor amplitude (11.5, Z = 0.23) are near the sample mean, indicating a generally present circadian structure despite elevated intradaily variability.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the sample mean PSQI: Balancing these sources, psychological distress (depression, trait anxiety, high perceived stress) and moderate-to-high within-day/circadian fragmentation and sleep-timing variability together point toward worse subjective sleep quality for this participant than for the average study participant. Protective factors—regular exercise, no substance use, absence of naps, clear nocturnal heart-rate decline, and low resting heart rate—mitigate but do not fully counterbalance the strong psychological risk signals. On balance, the evidence indicates the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI score (i.e., worse than average). Relative to the study sample mean PSQI = 6.73, the profile is more consistent with an elevated PSQI (above the mean) rather than near or below the mean, primarily driven by high depressive and anxiety symptoms and elevated intradaily rhythm fragmentation and sleep-timing variability."
35361,"Summary and overall inference
Across self-report, behavioral, and wearable physiology, the participant shows a pattern more consistent with relatively good sleep quality than with poor sleep quality. Circadian and cardiovascular markers indicate a well-entrained daily rhythm and clear nocturnal downregulation of heart rate; behavioral and survey data show limited mood symptoms, low substance use, and regular exercise — all factors that typically accompany lower PSQI scores. Considering the study sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely below the population mean PSQI (i.e., better than the average participant), though the inference is probabilistic and should be treated with caution given the modest size of many metric–PSQI correlations.

Evidence consistent with relatively low (better) PSQI
- Circadian structure and regularity: The participant’s interdaily stability is high (0.59, Z = +1.49) and intradaily variability is low (0.37, Z = −1.24). These values indicate a consistent day-to-day pattern and relatively little fragmentation of heart-rate-based activity across the day, features that are typically associated with better subjective sleep quality. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderately positive (0.41, Z = +0.73), supporting regular daily rhythms.
- Robust nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation: Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced negative deviations overnight (largest at 4–5 AM: −28.41 bpm, Z = −1.71) and lower mesor (67.79, Z = −0.84) with an elevated amplitude (13.48, Z = +0.87). This pattern — clear nocturnal dipping and a substantive day–night amplitude — is physiologically consistent with consolidated, restorative sleep and lower nocturnal arousal.
- Favorable behavioral and mental-health profile: The participant reports low depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 7, STAI-T = 38; both Z-scores below the sample mean), above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction, minimal substance use, and frequent exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more; Z = +1.07). These psychosocial and lifestyle features commonly predict better sleep and likely contribute to a lower PSQI.
- Objective sleep stability and quantity: Median nightly sleep duration is near 7 hours (6 h 56 m; Z = −0.31) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD = 61 minutes; Z = −0.91). Sleep start time variability is modest (SD = 73 minutes; Z = −0.21) and the participant reports essentially no daytime napping. Consistent sleep duration and timing stability generally favor better sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with relatively high (worse) PSQI
- Late habitual sleep onset: Median sleep start time is around 00:57 (approximately 1:00 AM). Later habitual bedtimes can increase risk for certain PSQI components (e.g., longer sleep latency, daytime dysfunction) for some individuals, particularly if combined with early wake obligations. The available data do not show clear, large impairments, but the late start time is a potential contributor to reduced sleep opportunity in some contexts.
- Sleep duration modestly below ideal threshold: Although near seven hours, the median duration is slightly below many recommended targets for young adults and is below the sample mean (Z = −0.31). If this shortfall is paired with high daytime demands, it could modestly elevate PSQI components related to sleep duration or daytime functioning.
- Small but non-negligible correlations: Several metrics show modest correlations with PSQI in the study sample (for example, depressive symptoms CES-D r ≈ 0.49, stress r ≈ 0.20, and some hourly heart-rate deviations r ≈ 0.18–0.22). In this participant these measures are generally favorable (low CES-D, moderate stress), but the presence of these associations in the sample cautions against overconfidence; small shifts in mood or stress could have measurable effects on the PSQI.

Integrated interpretation and caveats
Putting the pieces together, the wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate metrics (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, clear nocturnal HR dipping, elevated amplitude) and the favorable self-report profile (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high exercise, low substance use, good health satisfaction) point toward sleep quality that is better than the study population average. The main signals that could push in the opposite direction are the relatively late median sleep onset and a median duration just under seven hours; these are moderate, not large, negative signals in the context of the other data. Many of the individual metric–PSQI correlations in the dataset are small, so conclusions should be considered probabilistic rather than definitive.

Final statement
Based on the available multimodal evidence, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistently inferred to be below the study population mean PSQI (i.e., better than average). This inference is supported chiefly by robust circadian regularity, pronounced nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation, low symptom burden, and favorable lifestyle behaviors; it is tempered by the participant’s relatively late sleep onset and a median sleep duration just under seven hours."
49086,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian physiology: The participant’s wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 18 minutes with relatively few naps (mean daily naps 0.07). Sleep timing is markedly delayed: the median sleep start time is 02:19 AM (SD of start times ≈ 78 minutes), indicating a consistent late-night sleep schedule. Heart rate–based circadian summary metrics are broadly typical but not strongly robust: MESOR (≈69.5 bpm) and amplitude (~9 bpm) are slightly below the study mean (Z ≈ -0.6 for each), interdaily stability (0.39) and intradaily variability (0.52) are near the cohort average, and the cosinor acrophase is early evening (≈5:43 PM). Resting heart rate is low relative to the sample (56.3 bpm, Z ≈ -0.22), which is commonly associated with higher cardiovascular fitness and lower physiological arousal at baseline.

Objective signals and behaviors that point toward poorer sleep quality (factors likely to raise PSQI): The late habitual sleep onset (median ≈ 02:19 AM) is a salient risk factor for reduced sleep quality by several PSQI components (sleep latency, efficiency, and daytime dysfunction associated with late schedules). There is evidence of elevated physiological arousal around midnight: the aggregate deviation from MESOR at 12–1 AM is relatively high (≈+9.8 bpm, Z ≈ +1.66), which may reflect pre-sleep activation and could contribute to difficulty initiating sleep or fragmented early sleep. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is nontrivial (SD ≈ 107 minutes), and that irregularity is often linked to worse subjective sleep. Lifestyle factors that can worsen sleep quality include minimal regular exercise (responses indicate “not at all” for exercise, with large negative Z-scores relative to the sample) and moderate weekly consumption of wine/liquor (1–2 times per week; Z ≈ +0.94). Self-rated health satisfaction is relatively low (Z ≈ -0.7), which, in this sample, modestly associates with higher PSQI.

Objective signals and behaviors that point toward better sleep quality (factors likely to lower PSQI): The participant’s median total sleep time is within a healthy range (>7 h), which is protective against poor global PSQI scores. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.3 bpm), and the deep overnight heart rate reductions across the early-morning hours (large negative deviations from MESOR between ~2–7 AM) suggest consolidated physiological sleep once it is achieved. Psychological self-report also favors better sleep: depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) are substantially below the sample mean (Z ≈ -1.3 and -1.0 respectively), and higher self-esteem (Z ≈ +1.1) should be considered protective — in this dataset depression and anxiety show the strongest positive correlations with PSQI, so low scores on those measures are an important mitigating factor. Low daytime napping and modest intradaily variability also reduce the likelihood of pronounced fragmented sleep.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population: The data present a mixed but coherent picture. The participant benefits from adequate total sleep time, low resting heart rate, minimal depressive and anxiety symptoms, and low nap frequency — all features that would tend to lower PSQI. Counterbalancing these strengths are a consistently delayed sleep schedule, elevated pre-sleep physiological activation (notably around midnight), and meaningful night-to-night duration variability, together with low exercise and some alcohol exposure — features that would tend to increase PSQI. Taking the relative magnitudes and known correlations into account, the net profile suggests an overall sleep quality that is close to the study sample’s average. In other words, the participant’s inferred global sleep quality is near the population mean PSQI (population mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16); if anything it may be modestly better (slightly lower PSQI) because of the strong protective signal from low mood/anxiety and adequate total sleep time, but it does not appear to be markedly different from the cohort average.

Clinical and behavioral implications to consider: The most actionable targets to potentially improve subjective sleep quality are timing and pre-sleep arousal — shifting sleep onset earlier and reducing physiological/behavioral activation in the hour before the current habitual sleep time (e.g., stimulus control, wind-down routines, limiting evening alcohol and arousing activities) could reduce sleep latency and night-to-night variability. Increasing regular daytime physical activity would also be expected to have incremental benefits for sleep consolidation and perceived sleep quality in this participant, given the currently minimal exercise levels."
95490,"Overview: Across self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological measures, the participant shows a mixed pattern of sleep-related risk and protective features. Several behavioral and trait indicators point toward factors that are commonly associated with worse subjective sleep quality (higher PSQI), including late and variable sleep timing, elevated trait anxiety, and reduced day-to-day regularity in heart-rate–based circadian measures. At the same time, the participant has physiological signs of consolidated nocturnal cardiovascular down-regulation, a median nightly sleep duration near 7 hours, low daytime napping, regular exercise, and absence of recreational or non-prescribed drug use—features that tend to support sleep. Taken together, the evidence is most consistent with sleep quality somewhat worse than the sample average (i.e., a PSQI likely above the study population mean of 6.73), although not at an extreme level.

Evidence pointing toward higher (worse) PSQI: Behavioral and trait measures that predict poorer sleep are prominent. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) and moderate perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) are both positively associated with PSQI in the sample (STAI correlation ≈ 0.40; CES-D correlation ≈ 0.49), and anxiety-related arousal is a common contributor to sleep disturbance. Sleep timing is late and somewhat irregular: median sleep start time is 01:11 AM with a sleep-start SD of ~101 minutes (Z ≈ 0.40), indicating frequent shifts in bedtimes; inconsistent bedtimes are associated with worse subjective sleep. Nightly sleep duration is slightly below the sample mean (median 6 h 56 min, Z = -0.30) and shows non-trivial night-to-night variability (duration SD ≈ 103 minutes), which correlates modestly with worse PSQI in the study (r ≈ 0.20). Circadian-structure metrics derived from heart rate provide convergent evidence of instability: low interdaily stability (0.23, Z = -1.48) and low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = -1.12) indicate poor day-to-day regularity of cardiovascular rhythms—patterns that have been linked to sleep complaints. Intradaily variability is mildly elevated (0.60, Z = 0.39), suggesting some fragmentation of activity/rest within days. Weekly alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week) and a BMI in the overweight range (26.95) are additional contextual factors that can detract from sleep quality for some individuals.

Evidence pointing toward lower (better) PSQI: Several objective and behavioral features argue for at least partially preserved sleep physiology and sleep-supportive habits. Wearable heart-rate traces show substantial nocturnal reductions (nighttime hourly deviations from mesor of roughly -8 to -16 bpm across the 2–7 AM window), consistent with consolidated nocturnal autonomic down-regulation that typically accompanies meaningful sleep depth and continuity. Mean daily naps are rare (0.07/day), reducing the likelihood that daytime sleepiness reflects excessive daytime napping. The participant exercises regularly alone (three or more times per week, Z = 1.07), a behavior associated with improved sleep in many studies. The absence of recreational and non-prescribed drug use further reduces common sources of sleep disruption. The participant’s CES-D score (14) falls in the non-depressed range and the mesor and resting heart rate are only modestly elevated (resting HR 61.4, Z = 0.39), not suggesting pronounced physiologic hyperarousal across the recording period. Overall median nightly sleep duration just under 7 hours is within a range that supports adequate sleep for many adults, mitigating extreme sleep-deprivation effects.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the sample mean PSQI: Balancing risk and protective signals, the profile indicates greater likelihood of subjective sleep difficulties than the average study participant. Key drivers of this inference are the late and inconsistent sleep timing, low interdaily stability of circadian-heart-rate rhythms (Z = -1.48), and elevated trait anxiety—each of which has moderate-to-meaningful associations with PSQI in the sample and with subjective sleep disturbance in the broader literature. Countervailing evidence (objective nocturnal heart-rate declines, near-7-hour median duration, low napping, and regular exercise) suggests that sleep is not severely disrupted across all domains and that physiological sleep consolidation is present on many nights. Overall, the participant’s inferred sleep quality is best described as above the population mean PSQI (i.e., worse than average) but not at an extreme level; this pattern is consistent with intermittent or moderate subjective sleep complaints rather than pervasive severe insomnia.

Notes on interpretation and limitations: Correlations provided with PSQI are sample-level guides and do not determine individual outcomes; wearable-derived circadian metrics are summary measures aggregated across the semester and therefore describe typical profiles rather than night-to-night dynamics. The combination of late/variable bedtimes and elevated anxiety/stress presents the most actionable targets for improving subjective sleep quality (consistent scheduling, anxiety reduction strategies), whereas objective nocturnal physiology and regular exercise indicate intact sleep capacity on many nights."
90079,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant displays a pattern of objectively short and irregular sleep timing combined with modest psychosocial stress—features that converge on poorer sleep quality. Median wearable-recorded sleep was 5 hours 54 minutes (Z = -1.59), with a late median sleep onset near 01:53 AM and substantial night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 138 minutes) and start time (SD = 104 minutes). Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate further indicate weak day-to-day structure (interdaily stability = 0.21, Z = -1.65) and relatively high fragmentation of activity across the day (intradaily variability = 0.75, Z = 1.44), while cosinor amplitude is lower than typical (amplitude = 6.53, Z = -1.37). These objective features—short mean sleep, late and variable timing, low interdaily stability, and reduced circadian amplitude—are canonical behavioral and physiological correlates of elevated global PSQI scores.

Evidence consistent with relatively high PSQI (poorer sleep): The participant’s consistent short sleep duration (<6 hours) and late average sleep onset are both strongly characteristic of increased sleep complaints and daytime dysfunction in population studies. High sleep-duration variability and large variability in sleep start times undermine sleep regularity and are associated with worse subjective sleep. The circadian-derived profile—reduced 24-hour stability, elevated intradaily variability, low amplitude, and low autocorrelation at 24 hours—points to an attenuated and irregular circadian signal, which commonly co-occurs with poorer perceived sleep quality. Psychosocially, perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65) and depressive symptoms are nonzero (CES-D = 14); the CES-D has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.49), indicating that even subclinical mood symptoms could contribute to worse sleep. Resting heart rate is modestly higher than the sample mean (65.6 bpm, Z = 0.89), which can reflect greater physiological arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness and relates modestly to PSQI here (r ≈ 0.12).

Evidence consistent with relatively low PSQI (better sleep): Several protective features are present. The participant reports minimal or no alcohol and recreational drug use, low daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.07), and some regular physical activity (exercising 1–2 times per week), all of which reduce risk for sleep disruption. Self-reported anxiety (STAI trait = 38) and depressive symptom level are not in a clinically depressed or anxious range per classification, and self-rated health satisfaction is near the sample mean; these stable self-report indicators lessen the likelihood that severe mood or anxiety pathology is the primary driver of sleep problems. Wearable heart-rate profiles do show the expected overnight reductions in heart rate (hourly deviations negative across the typical sleep window), suggesting the participant does reach nocturnal physiological down-regulation consistent with consolidated sleep at least some nights.

Physiological and circadian interpretation: The participant’s aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nighttime reductions (largest negative deviations in the 1–6 AM window) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:54 PM). This pattern indicates a preserved diurnal rhythm in cardiovascular tone but one with diminished amplitude and weaker day-to-day consistency. In practical terms, the body’s circadian signal exists but is blunted and temporally shifted relative to typical daytime activity/rest cycles. The combination of late habitual sleep timing (~1:53 AM) and low interdaily stability suggests behavioral timing (e.g., late bedtimes or variable schedules) is a dominant factor contributing to the reduced sleep quantity and irregularity.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s profile is more consistent with poorer than average sleep quality. Objective markers (short median sleep duration, late and variable sleep timing, low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, and low circadian amplitude) are strong indicators of elevated PSQI scores, and psychosocial stress provides additional support for worse subjective sleep. Although protective factors (low substance use, low napping, modest exercise, absence of clinical depression/anxiety) mitigate some risk, they do not fully counterbalance the objective circadian and sleep-shortening signals. Compared to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s multimodal profile indicates sleep quality likely above the population mean (i.e., poorer sleep than average). Note that many individual correlations with PSQI in this dataset are modest; thus, conclusions rely on the convergent pattern across multiple modalities rather than any single metric."
22842,"Summary overview:
Across self-report and wearable-derived data the participant shows a mixed profile: relatively long median nightly sleep duration (7 h 51 m) and low resting heart rate that are typically protective, but pronounced late and variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:56 AM; sleep-start SD = 164 min, Z = 1.79), elevated depressive and trait-anxiety scores (CES-D = 20, Z = 0.7; STAI = 46, Z = 0.46), and an elevated rate of daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.28, Z = 2.4). When these modalities are combined and weighted by their known relationships to subjective sleep quality, the pattern is most consistent with overall sleep quality that is worse than the study sample mean PSQI (population mean PSQI = 6.71). The strongest contributors to that inference are the depressive symptom burden (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI), along with unstable and delayed bedtimes.

Features that indicate higher PSQI score (poorer sleep quality)
- Affective and cognitive vulnerability: CES-D (20, Z = 0.7) and STAI-trait (46, Z = 0.46) are both above the sample mean and have the largest positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40). These relationships are sizeable and indicate that higher depressive and anxiety symptoms are likely to be associated with worse subjective sleep quality for this participant. Lower self-esteem (RSES Z = -0.31) and lower current happiness (Z = -0.53) are also aligned with this direction given their negative correlations with sleep quality, adding psychosocial risk.
- Irregular, delayed sleep timing and variability: The participant’s median sleep start is very late (≈02:56 AM) and sleep start time variability is high (SD = 164 min, Z = 1.79). Increased variability in sleep timing and later bedtimes are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality, and here sleep-start variability shows a positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.17). High night-to-night variability in total sleep (duration SD = 133 min, Z = 0.73, r ≈ 0.20) further points to inconsistent sleep, which is often experienced as lower-quality sleep.
- Daytime napping: Mean daily naps are elevated (0.28, Z = 2.4) and correlate positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.16). Frequent naps can fragment sleep–wake consolidation and are associated with worse subjective sleep in cohort data.
- Behavioral markers consistent with arousal late at night: Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively elevated heart rate around midnight–2 AM (e.g., 1–2 AM deviation +2.76, Z = 1.49) compared with deeper troughs later in the night. Relative nocturnal elevations in cardiovascular tone around typical sleep onset are compatible with partial physiological arousal at bedtimes, which can impair sleep initiation or subjective sleep quality.

Features that indicate lower PSQI score (better sleep quality)
- Adequate nocturnal duration and nocturnal physiological descent: Median sleep duration is near 7 h 51 m (Z = 0.83), which is well within recommended ranges and typically supportive of better subjective sleep. Wearable heart-rate-derived features show a pronounced nocturnal decline (large negative deviations from mesor in early morning hours, e.g., 5–7 AM ~ -18 bpm), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest physiology rather than highly fragmented night-time wakefulness.
- Physical health and lifestyle supports: Resting heart rate is low (54.2 bpm, Z = -0.47), which commonly reflects cardiovascular fitness and is weakly associated with better sleep. The participant reports frequent individual exercise (three times a week or more, Z = 1.07) and low substance use (alcohol and drugs reported at very low frequencies), both of which are typically protective against poor sleep. High self-rated health satisfaction (Z = 0.88) also correlates with somewhat better sleep outcomes in the sample.
- Low intradaily variability and moderate circadian structure: Non-parametric circadian metrics (intradaily variability = 0.46, Z = -0.6; interdaily stability = 0.30, Z = -0.9) are not extreme in the direction of fragmentation; amplitude and MESOR are modestly lower than population mean (amplitude Z = -0.67; MESOR Z = -0.63) but the overall pattern still shows a clear daily trough and peak (acrophase ~6:03 PM), which supports some preservation of circadian rhythm.

Integrated interpretation and relative comparison to the sample mean PSQI:
Balancing these sources, the most influential signals pointing toward worse subjective sleep are elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (strongest correlations with PSQI), the very late and inconsistent sleep timing (large Z for sleep-start variability), and frequent naps. Protective signals—adequate median sleep duration, strong nocturnal heart-rate decline, regular exercise, low substance use, and lower resting heart rate—mitigate risk but do not fully counterbalance the psychosocial burden and timing irregularity. Taken together, the multimodal evidence supports an inference that this participant’s overall sleep quality is likely above the sample mean PSQI (i.e., poorer than the average participant in this cohort). This inference reflects the relatively large associations between mood/anxiety measures and PSQI in the dataset and the pronounced circadian/timing irregularity despite acceptable total sleep time.

Uncertainty and considerations:
This conclusion is probabilistic rather than definitive because a direct PSQI score for the participant is not provided here. Several objective markers (sleep duration, nocturnal heart-rate decline, fitness) favor good sleep and could reflect nights of consolidated sleep; however, subjective sleep quality typically tracks mood, anxiety, and schedule regularity quite closely, and those factors are moderately elevated here. If more weight were placed on nocturnal physiological consolidation alone, the inferred PSQI would be closer to the population mean; given the full multimodal profile, “above the population mean” (worse sleep) is the more consistent interpretation."
14279,"Summary and overall comparison to the study sample
Across the available multimodal measures, the participant’s profile contains more features that align with relatively good sleep quality than with poor sleep quality. Objective wearable measures show a robust, high-amplitude circadian pattern and a median nightly sleep duration substantially above the sample mean; self-report symptom scores for depression and trait anxiety are low. Taken together, these patterns are most consistent with an overall PSQI score that is below the study sample mean (population mean PSQI = 6.72), i.e., the participant’s sleep quality appears to be better than average in this sample.

Evidence indicating relatively good sleep quality (factors that would predict a lower PSQI)
- Sufficient and regular sleep quantity: wearable-derived median sleep duration is 8 hours 11 minutes (Z = 1.24), indicating longer-than-average nightly sleep in this cohort—typically associated with better subjective sleep quality. Nightly nap use is negligible (mean daily naps = 0.07), so daytime sleep likely does not fragment nighttime sleep consolidation.
- Robust circadian organization: cosinor and nonparametric circadian features indicate a pronounced daily rhythm (amplitude = 14.2, Z = 1.11) with modestly elevated interdaily stability (0.48, Z = 0.58) and a relatively high autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.42, Z = 0.81). These features point to a consistent day–night structure in physiology, which is generally associated with better sleep continuity and quality.
- Physiological indicators of nocturnal rest: aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show substantial nighttime reductions (e.g., ~–17 to –22 bpm across the 2–6 AM window), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and low nocturnal physiological arousal.
- Low affective symptom burden: self-report depression (CES-D = 5, Z = –0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = –0.33) are low relative to the sample; lower mood/anxiety levels are correlated in this dataset with better sleep and therefore support a lower PSQI estimate.
- Resting physiology within a healthy range: resting heart rate ~59 bpm (Z = 0.10) and a relatively stable sleep start time (median 00:17, sleep start SD = 66 minutes, Z = –0.37) are not strongly indicative of physiological or behavioral disturbance to sleep.

Evidence indicating relatively poorer sleep quality (factors that would predict a higher PSQI)
- Later sleep timing and some night-to-night variability: median sleep start near 00:17 (about 12:15 AM) and a sleep-start SD of ~66 minutes indicate a tendency toward relatively late bedtimes with moderate night-to-night variability; later and irregular timing can be associated with worse subjective sleep quality for some people.
- Intradaily variability and exercise/social patterns: intradaily variability is above the sample mean (0.62, Z = 0.53), and some recreational behaviors (e.g., weekly wine consumption reported as 1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94) could disrupt sleep for sensitive individuals. Although correlations in this dataset are small, these behavioral factors can elevate PSQI in some contexts.
- Small physiological–PSQI associations during early night: several hourly heart-rate deviations during the 2–4 AM window have small positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (correlations up to ~0.23). While the participant’s absolute nocturnal heart-rate reductions are large (indicating rest), those same magnitudes in the sample are modestly associated with worse PSQI, so this is an ambiguous signal that warrants cautious interpretation rather than a definitive indicator of poor sleep.
- Moderate variability in total sleep: the standard deviation of sleep duration (~93 minutes) shows some night-to-night fluctuation—slight variability that, if experienced as irregular, can contribute to poorer subjective sleep for some individuals (though the participant’s Z = –0.19 indicates this is near average for the cohort).

Integrated interpretation and practical implications
Taken together, the strongest, most consistent indicators (above-average nightly sleep duration, low affective symptom burden, pronounced circadian amplitude and reasonable interdaily stability, and clear nocturnal heart-rate reductions) point toward sleep quality that is better than the average participant in this study sample. Countervailing signals—later bedtimes with modest variability, somewhat elevated intradaily variability, and isolated behavioral factors such as weekly wine use—are relatively small in magnitude and do not outweigh the primary evidence for preserved sleep. Therefore the balance of evidence supports concluding that this participant’s inferred PSQI would likely fall below the population mean of 6.72 (i.e., relatively lower PSQI, indicating better-than-average sleep quality in this cohort). If clinical or intervention decisions are being considered, focusing on sleep-timing regularity (reducing night-to-night variability and earlier bedtimes where feasible) and monitoring the impact of evening alcohol could further reduce the remaining risk factors for poorer subjective sleep."
28327,"Summary of objective sleep and circadian physiology:
Wearable-recorded sleep metrics indicate a generally sufficient sleep quantity: median nightly sleep duration was 7 h 37 m (Z = +0.54), with relatively few naps (mean daily naps 0.12, Z = +0.61). Median sleep start time was late (00:54) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 68 minutes, Z ≈ -0.33) and sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 88 minutes, Z ≈ -0.29). Circadian features derived from heart rate show a pronounced day–night amplitude (amplitude = 14.01, Z = +1.04) and a moderate level of interdaily stability (0.49, Z = +0.67), with acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:17 PM). Resting heart rate was near the sample average (≈ 60 bpm, Z = +0.24). Hourly mean deviations from mesor show the expected large heart-rate nadir across the early-morning sleep window (roughly −20 to −22 bpm in the 4–7 AM range) and prominent elevations in the early evening (notably 6–8 PM, with Z-scores up to +2.24). There is also some elevation in the late-evening hour prior to midnight (11 PM–12 AM: +12.7, Z = +1.38).

Features that suggest relatively poorer sleep quality (likely to raise PSQI):
Psychological symptom burden is a prominent risk context for impaired sleep. Depressive symptoms are markedly elevated (CES‑D = 33, Z = +2.05), and trait anxiety is high (STAI = 58, Z = +1.65); in this sample both measures show substantial positive correlations with PSQI (CES‑D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating these are among the strongest predictors of higher (worse) PSQI scores. Low self‑esteem (RSES Z = −1.71), low self‑reported happiness (Z = −1.61), and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ −1.86) further align with the pattern of psychosocial risk factors that correlate with worse sleep in the study sample. Physiologically, elevated intraday variability in heart-rate rhythms (intradaily variability = 0.69, Z = +1.02) and pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (6–8 PM and around 11 PM) point to greater within‑day fragmentation and higher evening arousal; both patterns are plausibly linked to difficulty initiating or consolidating sleep and therefore to higher PSQI. Routine alcohol use at the level reported (beer or wine 1–2×/week) and late median sleep onset (around 1 AM) are additional behavioral factors that can contribute to subjective sleep disruption for some individuals.

Features that suggest relatively better sleep quality (likely to lower PSQI):
Several objective and behavioral indicators are consistent with at least adequate sleep health. Median nightly sleep duration is slightly above the study mean (7 h 37 m, Z = +0.54), and naps are uncommon, which supports consolidated nighttime sleep. Interdaily stability is modestly positive (Z = +0.67) and the circadian amplitude is relatively large (Z = +1.04), both of which indicate a reasonably robust and entrained circadian signal on average—features generally associated with more regular sleep timing and better sleep consolidation. Resting heart rate is within a typical range (≈60 bpm), recreational drug use is absent, and the participant reports some regular physical activity (exercise 1–2×/week), which are protective behavioral features for sleep. Objective variability in sleep timing and duration is not extreme (SDs modestly below sample average), which argues against extreme night-to-night instability as the primary driver of poor sleep.

Holistic integration and comparison to the study population mean PSQI:
Weighing psychological, behavioral, and physiological data together produces a mixed but coherent picture. Objective wearable data indicate adequate average sleep duration, reasonable circadian entrainment, and relatively low napping—factors that tend to reduce PSQI. In contrast, the participant’s elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both with substantial positive correlations to PSQI in the sample), low self‑esteem/happiness, and evidence of elevated evening physiological arousal are strong, convergent indicators that subjective sleep quality and sleep-related distress are likely worse than average. Given the magnitude of the mood/anxiety elevations (CES‑D Z ≈ +2.05; STAI Z ≈ +1.65) and their relatively large correlations with PSQI in this sample, the overall balance of evidence favors an inference that this participant’s global sleep quality is likely above the population mean PSQI (i.e., poorer sleep than average). In other words, although objective sleep duration and circadian amplitude are not severely disrupted, the psychosocial profile and evening arousal make it likely that the participant’s PSQI would fall above the study mean of 6.72.

Clinical/research implications (concise):
For study interpretation, treat objective duration and circadian robustness as protective features but treat elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and elevated evening arousal as primary contributors to elevated PSQI. If the aim is to improve sleep quality, interventions that target evening physiological/cognitive arousal (e.g., stimulus control, evening relaxation or cognitive strategies) and co‑occurring mood/anxiety symptoms would be likely to yield the biggest impact on global sleep quality for this participant."
52302,"The wearable-derived circadian profile indicates a coherent day–night pattern with a clear afternoon/evening heart rate peak (acrophase ~5:17 PM), a moderate-to-high amplitude (12.34, Z = 0.50) and a robust nocturnal heart rate dip (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–6:00 AM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.5 bpm, Z = -0.67), and the mesor is slightly lower than the sample mean (71.9, Z = -0.28). These features are consistent with preserved physiological sleep–wake contrast and cardiovascular fitness across the recording period.

Indicators that would be expected to increase the PSQI (i.e., reflect poorer sleep quality) center on timing irregularity and pre-sleep/trait factors. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (01:07 AM) and sleep timing is variable (sleep start SD ≈ 103 minutes, Z = 0.43), while sleep duration variability is also elevated (median duration 8 h 6 min but SD ≈ 123 minutes, Z = 0.51). Reduced interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm (0.37, Z = -0.33) and only modest 24-hour autocorrelation (0.34, Z = 0.14) point to day-to-day schedule inconsistency. Behavioral habits that can interfere with sleep consolidation—above-average evening screen and media engagement (TV/video and internet use, elevated Z-scores) and moderate evening socializing—also appear in the self-report data. Trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17), and trait anxiety in this sample correlates positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.40), suggesting a psychological pathway by which worry or hyperarousal could impair subjective sleep quality. Finally, small positive correlations between night-time hourly heart-rate deviations (notably around 2–4 AM) and PSQI imply that the degree of nocturnal physiological change may be associated with worse subjective sleep in this cohort.

Countervailing evidence consistent with relatively good sleep (lower PSQI) includes objectively long median sleep duration (8 h 6 min; Z = 1.14), low average resting heart rate (suggesting cardiovascular recovery), a clear circadian amplitude and nocturnal dip (features tied to consolidated nocturnal sleep), and minimal use of alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs (all “not at all,” Z-scores strongly negative). Self-report measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and perceived stress (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17) are not elevated, and reported happiness and health satisfaction are slightly above sample means; these psychosocial strengths are generally protective for sleep. Some regular physical activity is reported (exercise 1–2 times weekly), which may also support sleep consolidation despite being infrequent.

Integrating the multimodal evidence, the participant’s profile is mixed: sleep quantity and physiological sleep–wake contrast are favorable, but timing irregularity, late sleep onset, and modest trait anxiety are risk factors for poorer subjective sleep. On balance, the available data suggest overall sleep quality close to the study sample average, with a small tilt toward worse-than-average subjective sleep. Compared to the study population mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the pattern of elevated timing variability and late bedtimes—despite long total sleep and good physiological recovery—makes it most consistent with a PSQI near the population mean or marginally above it (i.e., slightly poorer sleep than the sample mean). This conclusion assumes the relative weighting of subjective timing/variability and trait anxiety in driving PSQI; uncertainty remains because many indicators (duration, resting physiology, low substance use) point in the opposite direction."
46418,"Objective, wearable-derived features of sleep and circadian physiology indicate a pattern consistent with relatively good and stable sleep. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 44 minutes (Z = 0.69), with a low night-to-night duration standard deviation (64 minutes, Z = -0.84) and no recorded naps (Z = -0.86). Circadian rhythm metrics from heart rate show high interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and low intradaily variability (0.30, Z = -1.73), a relatively large cosinor amplitude (15.07, Z = 1.39), and a normal mesor and resting heart rate. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected overnight reductions in heart rate and pronounced daytime/evening elevations, consistent with consolidated nighttime rest and a well-entrained 24-hour pattern. Together these objective indicators point to consistent timing, sufficient duration, low fragmentation, and robust circadian organization — all features that are typically associated with lower (better) PSQI scores.

In contrast, several self-report and behavioral features suggest factors that could elevate subjective sleep complaints. The participant endorsed a CES-D score of 18 (Z = 0.49), indicating elevated depressive symptoms; CES-D in this sample correlates positively with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49), so depressive symptom burden is a notable risk factor for poorer perceived sleep. The participant’s habitual sleep start time is late (median start ≈ 01:49), which can be associated with circadian misalignment and daytime impairment even when total sleep time is adequate. Weekly alcohol use (beer/wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0) and evening leisure (watching TV/videos 1–2 hours; Z = 1.28) are additional behavioral correlates that have small positive associations with worse PSQI in this sample. Lower health satisfaction (score 2.67, Z = -1.2) and a moderate perceived stress score (PSS = 22) further represent psychosocial factors that have been linked to increased sleep complaints.

When weighing objective and subjective evidence together, the balance favors relatively preserved objective sleep quality and circadian regularity, but with psychosocial and behavioral vulnerabilities that could raise subjective sleep disturbance. The strongest single signal for elevated PSQI-like complaints is the participant’s depressive symptom score (CES-D), which shows the largest positive correlation with PSQI in the provided data. However, multiple strong objective protective factors (adequate median sleep time, low variability, robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily fragmentation, no naps, and frequent exercise) argue against marked global sleep impairment as measured across the recording period.

Overall, taking both domains into account, the participant’s inferred sleep quality most plausibly lies near to or modestly better than the study population mean PSQI (study mean = 6.71). In other words, the participant’s data are consistent with PSQI at or slightly below the population mean (i.e., somewhat better than average), but there is sufficient psychosocial risk (notably elevated depressive symptoms, late bedtimes, and routine evening behaviors) that could drive higher subjective PSQI scores. This pattern suggests relatively good objective sleep with potential for subjective complaints; targeted assessment of sleep-related daytime functioning and subjective sleep quality (the PSQI components reflecting sleep disturbances, latency, and daytime dysfunction) would clarify the degree to which the psychosocial factors are affecting perceived sleep."
93002,"Summary: The available multimodal data indicate a mixed sleep profile with several behavioral and psychological signals that commonly co-occur with poorer subjective sleep, but also with physiological signatures consistent with an intact, robust circadian rhythm and good cardiovascular fitness. Objective wearable metrics show relatively short and variable nocturnal sleep with late bedtimes, while heart-rate–derived circadian measures show above-average stability and a strong nocturnal decline in heart rate. Self-report measures identify modest symptom burden on mood and anxiety scales and low self-rated well-being, which — by their published correlations with PSQI in this sample — are meaningful contributors to PSQI variance. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests sleep quality that is worse than the average study participant.

Evidence that would tend to increase PSQI (poorer sleep quality)
- Sleep timing and quantity: Median sleep duration is 6 h 28 m (Z = -0.88), and median sleep start time is late (01:16 AM) with moderately high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 120 min, Z = 0.43; sleep-start SD = 103 min, Z = 0.43). Shorter-than-average duration, late sleep onset and elevated night-to-night variability are each associated with higher PSQI in population studies, and the dataset’s internal correlations (sleep variability r ≈ 0.20; nap frequency r ≈ 0.17) point in the same direction.
- Nap behavior and irregularity: Mean daily naps (0.18/day; Z = 1.21) are higher than typical in the sample; more frequent napping is correlated with higher PSQI here and may indicate insufficient or fragmented nocturnal sleep.
- Psychological factors: CES-D score = 14 (Z ≈ 0.07) and STAI–Trait = 40 (Z ≈ -0.13) indicate some depressive symptomatology and elevated trait anxiety; in this dataset both CES-D and STAI show moderately strong positive correlations with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40, respectively), so these self-reported affective factors are likely to drive higher PSQI scores. Lower self-esteem (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87), lower current happiness (Z = -0.53), and modest perceived stress (PSS = 22, Z = 0.10) also align with the pattern of subjective distress that tends to accompany worse sleep (several of these scales correlate with PSQI in the expected direction).
- Low evening/behavioral buffers: Exercise frequency is low overall (exercising alone 1–2×/month; some group exercise 1–2×/week), and evening internet use is higher than average (2–3 hours, Z = 0.85). Limited regular physical activity and evening screen time are behavioral factors that often contribute to poorer sleep onset and continuity.

Evidence that would tend to decrease PSQI (better sleep quality)
- Robust circadian structure: Heart-rate circadian metrics indicate relatively strong day-to-day rhythm—interdaily stability = 0.49 (Z = 0.67) and 24-h autocorrelation = 0.42 (Z = 0.81). These higher-than-average stability metrics usually correspond to more consolidated sleep timing and better subjective sleep in group-level analyses (internal correlations are small but in the protective direction).
- Clear nocturnal cardiovascular decline and low resting HR: Aggregated hourly HR deviations show pronounced night-time reductions (e.g., −23 to −27 bpm between ~3–6 AM; several night hours Z < −1), and resting heart rate is low (48.25 bpm, Z = −1.18). A large nocturnal HR trough plus low resting HR are consistent with good parasympathetic predominance during sleep and with physiological sleep depth/quality in many samples.
- Reasonable circadian amplitude and daytime activation: MESOR and amplitude (amplitude Z = 0.30) show a measurable day–night contrast and an acrophase in mid-afternoon (~3:48 PM), suggesting a typical timing of daytime physiology that supports nocturnal sleep pressure. Low substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs) is also a protective behavioral factor for sleep continuity.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean PSQI
- Balancing the evidence: Behavioral and psychological indicators that are robustly associated with higher PSQI in this sample—shorter median sleep, late and variable sleep timing, higher nap frequency, and elevated scores on mood/anxiety measures (CES-D and STAI have the strongest correlations with PSQI in the dataset)—outweigh the protective physiological signs (strong interdaily stability and a pronounced nocturnal HR dip). In other words, physiological circadian integrity and low resting HR suggest the body is capable of consolidated sleep, but behavioral timing, variability, and affective state are the more salient predictors of subjective sleep problems in this dataset.
- Relative to the sample mean PSQI (mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16): The pattern of findings is most consistent with a PSQI above the population mean (i.e., poorer sleep quality than average). The combination of sub-7-hour median sleep, late habitual bedtimes, elevated variability and napping, and affective symptoms that correlate fairly strongly with PSQI supports this classification.

Key caveats
- The heart-rate values are temporally aggregated and do not provide night-to-night temporal trends; therefore physiological inferences are about overall circadian structure rather than specific nights with disturbance. Also, correlations reported in the dataset are associative and do not establish causality.

Clinical/research implications (brief)
- Interventions or monitoring focused on evening routines and sleep timing regularity (earlier, more consistent bedtimes; reduced evening screen time), behavioral strategies to reduce daytime napping, and addressing affective symptoms (anxiety/depressive symptoms) would be the most theoretically actionable targets given the observed pattern. The participant’s strong circadian stability and low resting HR suggest that behavioral changes could efficiently translate into improved subjective sleep quality."
56543,"Summary: The multimodal data paint a mixed but coherent picture in which the participant maintains a relatively consistent, late-timed sleep/wake pattern with physiological signs of evening arousal and concurrent elevations in self-reported mood symptoms. Several psychosocial and physiologic indicators that are strongly associated with poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI) are present — most notably elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms and high perceived stress — while several behavioral and circadian features are consistent with preserved regularity and some protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use, low napping).

Features that point toward poorer sleep quality
- Short, late sleep timing: Wearable-derived median sleep duration is 6 h 26 min (Z = −0.94), which is below the sample mean and commonly associated with worse subjective sleep quality. The median sleep start time is very late (about 02:22 AM), which is a strong behavioral contributor to disturbed sleep timing and daytime impairment. Sleep start time variability is only moderately elevated in absolute terms (SD ≈ 60 min, Z = −0.5), indicating the late timing is relatively stable rather than randomly variable.
- Elevated mood and stress symptoms linked to PSQI: The CES-D score (18; Z ≈ 0.49) and trait anxiety score (STAI = 50; Z ≈ 0.86) are above the sample mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D correlation ≈ 0.49, STAI ≈ 0.40). Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 25; Z ≈ 0.92), and stress has a positive association with worse PSQI in the sample; together these symptom elevations are credible risk factors for higher subjective sleep disturbance.
- Physiological arousal in the evening: Aggregate heart-rate deviations show large positive elevations in late evening hours (notably 10–11 PM with a deviation of +44 bpm and Z ≈ 5.94, and 9–10 PM also elevated). The participant’s MESOR and resting heart rate are higher than the study mean (Mesor ≈ 82.3, Z ≈ 1.14; resting HR = 68 bpm, Z ≈ 1.17). Elevated evening heart rate and higher baseline cardiac tone suggest increased pre-sleep physiological arousal that could delay sleep onset and degrade perceived sleep quality.
- Circadian fragmentation markers modestly elevated: Intradaily variability (0.59, Z ≈ 0.32) is slightly above average, consistent with some within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology; autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.28, Z ≈ −0.36), which can reflect weaker day-to-day repeatability in the overall rhythm and can be associated with worse sleep.

Features that point toward better sleep quality or protective behaviors
- Relative stability of daily schedule: Interdaily stability is above the sample mean (0.49, Z ≈ 0.67), indicating reasonably consistent timing of rest–activity across days. Sleep duration standard deviation is lower than the sample mean (SD ≈ 71 min, Z ≈ −0.67), and sleep start time variability is not large; these patterns suggest the participant’s schedule is regular (albeit late) rather than erratic, which can be protective for some aspects of sleep quality.
- Low napping and low substance use: Mean daily naps are minimal (≈0.1/day, Z ≈ 0.31) and the participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use; both factors reduce the likelihood that daytime substances or compensatory naps are driving poor nighttime sleep.
- Physical activity and other positive lifestyle factors: The participant reports exercising alone three times per week or more (Z ≈ 1.07), which is modestly protective for sleep. Reading time and self-reported health satisfaction are relatively high (reading time Z ≈ 4.24; health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.88), which may reflect routines or health behaviors that support sleep maintenance.

Circadian/physiological synthesis
The cosinor-derived acrophase is in the early evening (≈6:44 PM), with a MESOR and resting HR above average and a modest amplitude, indicating a shifted but structured cardiac rhythm. The pronounced elevation in heart rate during late evening hours (especially 10–11 PM) suggests a mismatch between physiological arousal and the late behavioral sleep onset (≈02:22 AM): rather than showing a physiological wind-down before bedtime, the pattern shows sustained evening activation that could prolong sleep latency. Nighttime heart-rate deviations become markedly negative relative to the mesor across the overnight period (midnight to morning), consistent with expected nocturnal fall in heart rate once sleep is achieved; however, the pre-sleep period appears physiologically activated, which aligns with the participant’s late sleep onset and with the mood/stress profile.

Holistic comparison to the study population mean PSQI
Weighing the evidence, the balance of risk factors (short sleep duration, very late sleep timing, elevated evening heart rate, and above-average depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) outweighs the protective indicators (stable timing, low substance use, regular exercise). Therefore the participant’s overall sleep quality, as inferred from the combined self-report and wearable data, is likely poorer than the average study participant. In terms of the study sample’s PSQI distribution (mean = 6.72, SD = 2.16), the available data suggest this participant’s sleep disturbance is above the population mean (i.e., a higher PSQI score than average), consistent with a moderate degree of subjective and physiological sleep disturbance relative to the sample.

Caveats
These inferences integrate cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable metrics and rely on correlations within the study sample; they do not establish causality. The hourly heart-rate values are temporally aggregated and should be interpreted as habitual diurnal physiology rather than night-by-night dynamics."
89142,"Summary of primary sleep-related signals (objective and subjective): Wearable-recorded sleep is characterized by a short median nightly duration (5 hours 50 minutes; Z = -1.68) and a late median sleep onset time (≈01:02). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively high (SD ≈ 123 minutes; Z = 0.51), and sleep start times show moderate variability (SD ≈ 60 minutes; Z = -0.49). These objective patterns point to habitual short sleep and inconsistent sleep opportunity across the semester. At the same time, wrist-derived circadian metrics show a modestly preserved 24-hour structure (interdaily stability = 0.45, Z = 0.33) and relatively low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.44, Z = -0.74), and hourly heart‑rate deviations indicate a robust nocturnal heart‑rate nadir. These latter features are consistent with an intact circadian timing signal and consolidated physiological quiescence overnight.

Evidence indicating factors likely to increase PSQI (poorer sleep): The combination of short median sleep duration (<6 hours) and pronounced night-to-night variability are both typical contributors to worse subjective sleep quality and insomnia symptoms; the duration deficit (Z = -1.68) is a substantial departure from the sample mean. Behavioral factors that commonly impair sleep are present: a late habitual bedtime (~1:00 AM) and frequent evening engagement in stimulating activities (video gaming shows an elevated usage Z = 1.71; reading time is high, Z = 2.28 — which may be protective or stimulating depending on timing/content). Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66) and low self‑esteem and lower self-reported happiness (self‑esteem Z = -0.87; happiness Z = -0.53) are also present; these affective trait signals have nontrivial correlations with PSQI in the study (STAI r ≈ 0.40; CES‑D r ≈ 0.49 for depressive symptoms, though CES‑D here is near the sample mean). Low satisfaction with personal health (health satisfaction Z = -2.45) also aligns with higher PSQI in the sample. Collectively, short sleep, late and variable bedtimes, and elevated trait anxiety/self-reported poorer health are the strongest set of signals in favor of a higher PSQI score.

Evidence indicating factors likely to decrease PSQI (better sleep): Several objective and subjective features are consistent with relatively preserved sleep regulation and lower subjective disturbance. Circadian rhythm measures indicate a coherent 24‑hour structure (interdaily stability slightly above the mean and low intradaily variability), and aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a clear nocturnal dip, both of which are associated with consolidated sleep and better perceived sleep continuity. Resting heart rate is low (45.6 bpm, Z = -1.49), which often reflects good cardiovascular fitness and physiologic parasympathetic predominance overnight — factors that can support sleep quality. The participant reports essentially no substance use (alcohol, recreational/non-prescribed drugs all reported as ""not at all"") and reports extremely low perceived stress (PSS = 0, Z = -5.88), both of which are protective against sleep disturbance. These protective signals mitigate, to an extent, some of the adverse indicators listed above.

Integrated interpretation and relative weighting: Putting the signals together, the objectively short and inconsistent sleep opportunity and the elevated trait anxiety/self‑reported low health satisfaction are the most salient contributors pointing toward poorer sleep quality for this participant. Protective signals — low substance use, low perceived stress, preserved circadian structure, clear nocturnal cardiac quiescence, and low resting heart rate — are meaningful but generally address physiological capacity for consolidated sleep rather than behavioral opportunity (time in bed) and cognitive‑affective contributors to sleep perception. Given the magnitude of the short-sleep signal (median <6 h, Z = -1.68) and the presence of late / variable bedtimes combined with elevated anxiety, the balance of evidence favors a higher PSQI score than the sample average.

Conclusion relative to the study population mean: Considering the full multimodal profile, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI level above the population mean (population mean PSQI = 6.73). The short median sleep duration, late and variable bedtimes, and affective trait elevations carry relatively greater weight than the protective physiological and low-stress reports, making an above‑mean PSQI the more likely outcome in this sample. Caveats: wearable heart‑rate and cosinor metrics are aggregated across days and cannot disambiguate cause–effect or day‑to‑day context; self-report measures may under- or over-report symptoms; and some protective and risk signals (e.g., low resting HR despite reported lack of exercise) are internally inconsistent and should be interpreted cautiously."
24898,"Objective wearable data indicate a relatively well-structured circadian and nocturnal physiological profile. Heart-rate cosinor parameters show a pronounced amplitude (Z = +1.64) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:05 PM), and interdaily stability is high (0.65, Z = +1.99), while intradaily variability is low (0.34, Z = -1.45). Together these features imply a consistent, high-amplitude daily rhythm with low within-day fragmentation. The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a robust nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations between ~1:00–5:00 AM, Zs ≈ -2 to -1.5), and resting heart rate is relatively low (49.4 bpm, Z = -1.04). Night-to-night variability in sleep start time and sleep duration is modest (SDs Z ≈ -1.07 and -0.88 respectively), and mean daily naps are effectively absent. These objective indicators (strong circadian stability, clear nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation, low fragmentation, consistent timing and few naps) are each typically associated with better sleep continuity and quality.

At the same time, several features point toward potential sources of elevated sleep disturbance. Median wearable-recorded sleep duration is 6 hours 14 minutes (Z = -1.18), meaning the participant sleeps less than the study average and may be exposed to chronic short sleep. The median sleep start time (00:54) is relatively late; evening timing and shorter total sleep can increase probability of subjective sleep problems. Self-report measures show some elevation in trait anxiety (STAI trait = 45, Z = +0.37) and perceived stress (PSS = 24, Z = +0.65), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in the sample and can contribute to sleep complaints (on-set/maintenance difficulties, nonrestorative sleep). Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES Z = -1.01), which has a negative correlation with sleep quality in the sample and could indirectly affect sleep-related cognitions or mood at night. Although substance use is minimal, these psychosocial factors represent plausible contributors to higher PSQI scores despite favorable physiological rhythms.

Several behavioral and lifestyle features are protective for sleep quality. The participant reports frequent exercise and sports (three times per week or more; exercise Z-scores > +1), low recreational drug and alcohol use, and high satisfaction with physical health; these behaviors typically support sleep consolidation and daytime functioning. The participant’s low nap frequency and relatively low variability in sleep timing also favor consolidated nocturnal sleep. Objective signs of cardiovascular fitness (low resting HR) and the strong nocturnal heart-rate nadir further support efficient physiological recovery during sleep. These elements counterbalance the shortened total sleep duration and psychosocial strain to reduce the likelihood of severe sleep fragmentation.

Integrating the multimodal evidence yields a balanced inference about overall sleep quality relative to the study population. The profile shows stronger-than-average circadian regularity and low fragmentation, but shorter-than-average sleep duration and modestly increased anxiety/stress. On balance, the indicators most strongly associated with poor PSQI (short duration and elevated anxiety/stress) are present but moderate in magnitude, whereas several robust objective markers (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, clear nocturnal HR decline, consistent timing, frequent exercise) point toward comparatively good sleep physiology. Therefore the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with a PSQI level below the study population mean (i.e., better than average sleep quality), though not without risk factors that could elevate subjective complaints. 

Clinical or research implications: monitoring and, if desired, targeting total sleep time (e.g., modestly advancing bedtime or increasing time in bed) and addressing anxiety/stress-related sleep behaviors would be the most direct ways to reduce residual risk for poorer subjective sleep quality, while maintaining the current regular schedule and exercise habits that appear to support restorative sleep."
74413,"Protective features consistent with relatively good sleep quality are prominent across both self-report and wearable-derived metrics. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 34 minutes (Z = 0.47), with a relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 42 minutes; Z = -1.34), indicating consistent total sleep time across the recording period. Self-reported measures show low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02), both of which are associated in the literature with better subjective sleep and with lower PSQI scores in this sample (CES-D correlates r ≈ 0.49 with PSQI, STAI r ≈ 0.40). Regular exercise (exercising alone three times/week or more; Z = 1.07), minimal substance use, very low daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.08), and modest recreational screen time also support consolidated nocturnal sleep. Physiologically, a relatively low resting heart rate (55.4 bpm, Z = -0.33) and a clear nocturnal heart-rate decline across the early-morning hours (largest negative deviations from mesor between ~3:00–7:00 AM) are consistent with normal overnight autonomic downregulation and fitness-related cardiac tone that typically accompany better sleep.

At the same time, several features point toward factors that could increase the likelihood of a higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality). The participant’s circadian structure based on heart-rate rhythms shows reduced interdaily stability (0.36, Z = -0.41) and elevated intradaily variability (0.76, Z = 1.51). Reduced interdaily stability indicates less consistent day-to-day timing of physiological rhythms, and higher intradaily variability indicates more fragmentation of activity–rest transitions; both features are plausibly linked to worse sleep continuity and subjective sleep complaints. The time of sleep onset is relatively late (median sleep start ~00:32) and the aggregate hourly heart-rate pattern shows an unusually high deviation from the mesor between 10–11 PM (+22 bpm, Z = 2.46) and a modest elevation around midnight (12–1 AM +7.4 bpm, Z = 1.32). Elevated evening heart rate and a late bedtime suggest physiological or behavioral evening arousal (e.g., heightened sympathetic tone, caffeine/exertion close to bedtime, or delayed sleep timing) that could impair sleep initiation or perceived sleep quality despite adequate total duration. The participant’s health satisfaction is relatively low (score 2.67, Z = -1.2), and a BMI of 27.1 may represent another small risk factor for sleep disruption in some individuals.

Interpreting the cosinor and aggregate hourly heart-rate results together: the participant exhibits an expected evening acrophase (18:27), modest amplitude (10.99 bpm) and a mesor of ~75 bpm with a robust nocturnal decline. These features show a typical circadian pattern overall, but the combination of elevated late-evening heart rate and high intradaily variability indicates that the timing and consolidation of activity are less rigid than in peers. Because the hourly heart-rate deviations are aggregated across days, they suggest a general tendency toward greater physiological activation in the late evening hours and more variable transitions between activity and rest states—patterns that can contribute to fragmented or less restorative sleep independent of total sleep time.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSQI (mean = 6.73, SD = 2.16): weighing the evidence, the participant demonstrates multiple strong protective signals (adequate and consistent sleep duration, low mood/anxiety symptoms, healthy lifestyle behaviors, low resting heart rate) alongside circadian/behavioral features that could elevate sleep complaints (high intradaily variability, reduced interdaily stability, elevated evening physiological arousal, relatively late sleep onset). Taken together, these data suggest overall sleep quality near the study population mean, with a slight tendency toward better-than-average sleep (i.e., PSQI likely near or modestly below the population mean). This conclusion is tentative: the circadian fragmentation and evening arousal are notable risk factors that could produce occasional or domain-specific sleep problems (sleep onset latency or sleep continuity) despite normal total sleep time. Correlations between many of these metrics and PSQI in the sample are modest, so the relative balance of protective versus risk features should be interpreted cautiously and, if desired, followed up with targeted questions about sleep onset, nighttime awakenings, and evening routines."
77789,"Summary of wearable sleep and circadian physiology:
The participant’s wearable-recorded sleep pattern is characterized by a relatively late habitual sleep onset (median sleep start ~01:19) and a median nightly duration of 6 hours 32 minutes (Z = -0.80), indicating shorter-than-average sleep relative to the study sample. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is notable: standard deviation of 166 minutes (Z = 1.49) reflects high inconsistency in how long the participant sleeps across nights. Circadian heart-rate features show a higher-than-average mesor (83.16 bpm, Z = 1.26) and elevated resting heart rate (68.7 bpm, Z = 1.25), but a reduced circadian amplitude (Z = -0.99), suggesting an overall higher baseline cardiovascular activation with a blunted day–night amplitude in heart-rate rhythm. Nonparametric circadian measures are mixed: interdaily stability is above average (Z = 0.67), indicating relatively consistent timing of the rhythm across days, while intradaily variability is slightly below average (Z = -0.39), indicating relatively low fragmentation within days. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough (strong negative deviations ~2–7am) but a small positive deviation around midnight (12–1am, +2.02), which is consistent with later sleep onset.

Self-report psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context:
On self-report measures the participant endorsed elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 20; Z ≈ 0.7) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; Z ≈ 0.17). Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES = 36; Z = -0.31). Perceived stress is lower than average (PSS Z = -0.44), and substance use is minimal (infrequent alcohol; no recreational or non-prescribed drugs). Physical activity is low (exercise frequency low to none; Z-scores negative), health satisfaction is below average (Z = -0.86), and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Academically the participant has very high grades (GPA values near 4.0). These survey measures carry known correlations with sleep quality in the study sample (e.g., CES-D correlated r ≈ 0.50 with PSQI; STAI r ≈ 0.40), which is relevant to interpretation.

Elements indicating greater likelihood of poor sleep quality (higher PSQI):
- Short median nightly sleep duration (6:32) and late median sleep start (~1:19 AM) are both commonly associated with worse subjective sleep quality and higher PSQI scores.  
- High night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 166 min; Z = 1.49) is positively correlated with PSQI in the sample (duration SD correlation ~0.20) and tends to worsen perceived sleep continuity and daytime functioning.  
- Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 20; correlated r ≈ 0.50 with PSQI) and higher trait anxiety (STAI = 43; r ≈ 0.40) are robust correlates of poorer sleep and would be expected to push PSQI upwards.  
- Physiological markers of elevated baseline autonomic activation — higher mesor and resting heart rate (both Z ≈ +1.25) — together with a blunted circadian amplitude (Z ≈ -0.99) may reflect increased physiological arousal and reduced circadian robustness, patterns that tend to associate with worse sleep quality in group-level data.

Elements indicating greater likelihood of better sleep quality (lower PSQI):
- Interdaily stability is relatively high (Z = 0.67), suggesting consistent day-to-day timing of rhythms, which is generally protective for sleep quality.  
- Intradaily variability is slightly below average (Z = -0.39), indicating less within-day fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm; low fragmentation can be associated with consolidated sleep.  
- Low frequency of naps, minimal substance use, and limited evening leisure screen exposure (self-reported minimal TV/videos and short internet usage) are behavioral features that commonly support better nocturnal sleep.  
- Perceived stress is lower than average (PSS Z = -0.44) and self-reported current happiness is above average (Z = 0.55), both of which can buffer sleep disruption even in the presence of depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and relative comparison to the study population:
Weighing the evidence, the most salient signals point toward elevated risk for poorer sleep quality relative to the study sample. The combination of late sleep timing, shorter median sleep duration, marked night-to-night variability, and the presence of elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are all individually and jointly associated with higher PSQI scores in the cohort (CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI are among the largest provided). Physiological signs of increased baseline cardiac activation (higher mesor and resting HR) and reduced circadian amplitude further align with worse subjective sleep in population-level associations. Protective features (relatively high interdaily stability, low intradaily fragmentation, minimal substance use, and low nap frequency) mitigate some risk but do not fully offset the multiple risk markers described above.

Based on the pattern and magnitude of these features, the participant’s overall sleep quality is most consistent with being above the population mean PSQI score (i.e., worse sleep than average in this sample). The sample mean PSQI is 6.73 (SD 2.16); while a definitive PSQI score for this participant is not provided here, the preponderance of risk indicators (shorter sleep, high variability, depressive symptoms, late timing, elevated resting HR) suggest an expected PSQI higher than the sample mean rather than near or below it.

Limitations and caveats:
This inference integrates cross-sectional wearable aggregates and self-report trait measures and relies on correlations from the study sample; it does not substitute for an actual PSQI score or clinical assessment. Some circadian and behavioral metrics (e.g., interdaily stability, low substance use) are protective and reduce certainty that sleep quality is uniformly poor on all nights. If precise classification is required, direct PSQI item scores or additional sleep diaries would reduce uncertainty."
88882,"Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics point to several objective patterns that would tend to increase the likelihood of poorer sleep quality. Median nightly sleep duration is brief (5 h 57 m; Z = -1.53), which is substantially below the study sample mean and is a robust contributor to worse PSQI scores in this dataset. The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (approximately 2:34 AM) — a consistently late sleep timing combined with a short total sleep window is a common driver of impaired subjective sleep quality. Nightly heart-rate timing shows a pronounced positive deviation from the mesor at 1–2 AM (mean deviation +14.1, Z = 3.10), suggesting elevated physiological arousal around the participant’s typical sleep-onset period; this elevated overnight arousal is concordant with signals of disturbed sleep and relates positively (though modestly) to PSQI in the sample. Nonparametric circadian summaries also point toward weaker day-to-day structure: interdaily stability is below average (0.34, Z = -0.57) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.23, Z = -0.78), while intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.63, Z = 0.60). Together, those circadian features indicate a relatively fragmented and less consistent 24-hour pattern of physiological activity, which is commonly associated with higher PSQI scores.

There are several objective features that mitigate the above concerns and are associated with relatively better sleep or sleep-related resilience. Resting heart rate is low (47.4 bpm; Z = -1.28), consistent with relatively high cardiovascular fitness — a trait that is generally linked to better sleep maintenance and lower daytime sleepiness. Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is not excessive: sleep start time standard deviation (≈40 minutes; Z = -0.95) and sleep-duration standard deviation (≈68 minutes; Z = -0.76) are both below the population mean, indicating that although the participant’s schedule is late, it is relatively stable across days (consistency can be protective for subjective sleep quality even when timing is late). Mean daily napping is minimal (0.08 naps/day), which reduces the likelihood that daytime napping is undermining nocturnal sleep.

Self-reported psychological and lifestyle measures further nuance the profile by supplying protective psychosocial factors. Scores for depressive symptoms (CES-D = 2; Z = -1.18) and trait anxiety (STAI = 28; Z = -1.31) are low; perceived stress is below average (PSS Z = -0.98), and self-reported happiness and self-esteem are relatively high (happiness Z = 1.64; self-esteem Z = 1.10). Regular exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07) and general satisfaction with health (Z = 0.55) are additional behaviors that typically correlate with better sleep quality. Alcohol use (beer 1–2x/week; Z = 1.01) is present at a modest level and may slightly increase risk for poorer sleep continuity for some individuals, but other substance use is minimal. Overall, the self-report domain contains more protective than risk signals for sleep disturbance.

Balancing these signals yields a nuanced interpretation. The strongest and most salient contributors to likely elevated PSQI are objective: substantially short median sleep duration, very late sleep timing, and evidence of overnight physiological arousal (especially the large 1–2 AM heart-rate deviation), together with lower interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation. These objective factors carry direct relevance to PSQI components (sleep duration, sleep latency/efficiency, and sleep disturbances). Protective influences — low mood and anxiety symptoms, regularity in schedule (albeit late), frequent exercise, low napping, and low resting heart rate — reduce some of the overall risk for poor subjective sleep and suggest that daytime function and mood are relatively preserved.

On balance, the integrated evidence indicates that this participant’s sleep quality is likely worse than the study population average. Compared to the sample mean PSQI of 6.73 (SD = 2.16), the participant’s pattern of short sleep duration, late sleep timing, and nocturnal physiological arousal point toward a PSQI level that is above the population mean. However, relatively low affective symptom burden, consistent (if late) timing, regular exercise, and low napping act as partial buffers against more severe subjective sleep impairment."
19245,"Summary of multimodal patterns: The participant’s data show a mixture of physiological, behavioral, and self-report indicators that point in opposing directions for sleep quality. Wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 hours 6 minutes; Z = +1.14), and resting heart rate and several overnight heart-rate features indicate robust cardiovascular recovery during the biological night. At the same time, the participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 26, Z = +1.32), high trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35), and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 27, Z = +1.47), all of which have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40; PSS r ≈ 0.20) and therefore represent important risk factors for poorer subjective sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): Several behavioral and physiological markers suggest vulnerability to disturbed sleep. The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (≈ 02:38 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability in sleep start (SD ≈ 125 min, Z = +0.92) and in sleep duration (SD ≈ 155 min, Z = +1.23). These irregular sleep-timing patterns and the elevated mean daily nap rate (0.27 naps/day; Z = +2.27) align with higher PSQI in the study (sleep timing variability and naps correlate positively with PSQI; SD of duration r ≈ 0.20, naps r ≈ 0.17). Circadian-regularity metrics also point toward weakened day-to-day structure: interdaily stability is below the cohort mean (value = 0.31, Z = -0.82), and autocorrelation at 24 h is slightly low (Z = -0.11), implying less consistent daily rhythming—features commonly associated with worse sleep continuity and subjective sleep complaints. Physiologically, the aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show unusually elevated evening and late-night heart rate relative to the participant’s mesor (notably 10–11 PM: +20.7, Z = +2.25; 11–12 AM: +16.7, Z = +1.98; 12–1 AM: +9.6, Z = +1.63). Elevated evening/nighttime heart rate deviations (and positive correlations for some night hours with PSQI up to r ≈ 0.23) are consistent with pre-sleep physiological arousal that can lengthen sleep latency or disrupt sleep continuity and therefore increase PSQI.

Evidence consistent with better sleep quality (lower PSQI): The wearable-recorded central tendency of sleep duration is longer than the sample average (median 8 h 6 min, Z = +1.14), which typically protects against some aspects of poor sleep quality and daytime impairment. Resting heart rate is low (49.6 bpm; Z = -1.02), and the overnight heart-rate troughs between ~3–7 AM are large negative deviations from mesor (e.g., 4–5 AM: -21.0), indicating preserved nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation that is generally compatible with consolidated sleep and good physiological recuperation. Behavioral health habits that tend to support sleep are present: regular exercise (exercised alone ≥3×/week; Z = +1.07) is relatively frequent and is modestly associated with lower PSQI in this cohort. Some non-parametric circadian measures (intradaily variability Z ≈ -0.25) do not indicate marked fragmentation of activity within days. These features mitigate, to some degree, the risks shown by the late timing and subjective symptom burden.

Integrative interpretation and relative comparison to the sample: When weighted holistically, the combination of (1) substantial internalizing symptom burden (depression and trait anxiety elevated and strongly correlated with PSQI), (2) late and irregular sleep timing with frequent napping, (3) reduced interdaily regularity, and (4) elevated evening heart-rate deviations suggests a net profile that is more consistent with higher subjective sleep disturbance than with good sleep. Protective elements (long average sleep duration, low resting HR, regular exercise, and intact nocturnal HR troughs) reduce the likelihood that objective sleep quantity is globally insufficient, but they do not fully offset the risks associated with timing irregularity, physiological evening arousal, and elevated mood/anxiety symptoms—factors that tend to raise PSQI. Compared to the study population mean PSQI (mean = 6.72), the overall pattern of evidence is most consistent with the participant having sleep quality above the population mean (i.e., worse than average), driven primarily by psychological symptoms, timing irregularity, and evening physiological arousal.

Magnitude and uncertainty considerations: Several of the strongest quantitative signals linking to higher PSQI in this participant are the elevated CES-D and STAI scores (both >+1 SD from the sample mean and with relatively high sample correlations with PSQI), the large Z-scores for evening heart-rate deviation (up to +2.25), and the high Z for nap frequency (+2.27). Conversely, the protective indicators (e.g., sleep duration Z ≈ +1.1; resting HR Z ≈ -1.0) are meaningful but have weaker sample-level correlations with PSQI. Because the dataset mixes objective and subjective indices and some associations are modest, the inferred designation (“above the population mean”) should be treated as a probabilistic interpretation rather than a definitive classification."
83748,"Summary of protective indicators (factors associated with lower PSQI / better sleep): The participant’s self-report profile and some wearable markers consistently point toward relatively good sleep-related functioning. Psychologically they report low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 9, Z = -0.45) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71); both scales show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), so these low scores are protective. High self‑esteem (RSES Z = 1.52) and above‑average current happiness (Z = 1.64) are also associated in the sample with better sleep (self‑esteem r ≈ -0.35, happiness r ≈ -0.27). Health behaviors that tend to support sleep are present: frequent exercise (three times/week or more; exercise Zs > 1) and minimal alcohol or recreational drug use. Wearable physiology is consistent with a relatively healthy cardiovascular profile (resting heart rate 55.3 bpm, Z = -0.34) and nocturnal declines in heart rate across the night (hourly deviations are substantially negative during the 1–6 a.m. window), which is typical of sleep periods and, in general, favorable for restorative sleep.

Summary of risk indicators (factors associated with higher PSQI / poorer sleep): Several behavioral and circadian signals suggest modest sleep vulnerability. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 54 min (Z = -0.35), slightly below 7 hours; although the direct correlation of median duration with PSQI in this sample is small (r ≈ 0.05), shorter sleep tends to contribute to poorer subjective sleep. Sleep duration variability is notable: SD ≈ 103 minutes (Z ≈ 0.05) and its correlation with PSQI is positive in the sample (r ≈ 0.20), indicating that night‑to‑night variability in sleep length could elevate perceived sleep problems. Circadian regularity measures show some attenuation of day‑to‑day structure: interdaily stability is modestly low (0.37, Z = -0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (0.22, Z = -0.87), consistent with weaker day‑to‑day rhythmicity; lower interdaily stability and autocorrelation have been linked to worse sleep quality in population studies. The wearable hourly heart rate profile shows relatively large positive deviations in the late evening (notably 11–12 a.m. deviation = +26.98, Z = 3.51) and strong evening peaks at 5–7 p.m.; elevated physiological activation in the late evening or near bedtime can interfere with sleep initiation and quality. Finally, median sleep start time is late enough (≈00:20) that, when combined with slightly short total sleep, this pattern may reduce total restorative sleep opportunity.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the strongest protective signals are favorable psychological status (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem and happiness), regular bedtimes (sleep start time SD ≈ 41 minutes, Z = -0.93), frequent exercise, low substance use, and a healthy resting heart rate and nocturnal heart‑rate suppression. The most prominent risks are modestly short median sleep (~6 h 54 min), elevated night‑to‑night duration variability (SD ≈ 103 min) and somewhat weakened circadian regularity (reduced 24‑h autocorrelation and lower interdaily stability), together with evidence of elevated late‑evening physiological activation. Taken together, these patterns suggest overall sleep quality that is somewhat better than the average in this study sample. Specifically, relative to the population PSQI mean of 6.73 (SD 2.16), the balance of protective factors and only modest physiological/behavioral risks indicates an inferred PSQI level likely below the population mean (i.e., better than average), though not by a large margin; the participant shows a generally healthy profile but with identifiable targets (reduce evening physiological arousal and decrease night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration) that, if addressed, could further lower subjective sleep complaints."
63347,"Indicators pointing toward relatively poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI): The participant’s sleep timing is late and variably timed—median sleep start at ~01:28 and a large night-to-night sleep-duration standard deviation (151 minutes; Z = 1.14) suggest irregular and delayed sleep schedules. Irregular timing and high night-to-night variability are associated here with worse PSQI (sleep start variability correlates r ≈ 0.18 with PSQI; duration variability r ≈ 0.20). Trait-level anxiousness (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37; PSQI correlation r ≈ 0.40) and modest depressive symptoms (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07; PSQI correlation r ≈ 0.49) are psychosocial features that have moderate positive associations with higher PSQI in this sample. Additional lifestyle features that tend to co-occur with poorer sleep include low exercise (no reported regular exercise; Z-scores strongly negative) and relatively low health satisfaction (3.22; Z = -0.78; PSQI correlation r ≈ -0.21), both of which are in the direction expected to increase sleep complaints. Finally, several wearable-derived evening heart-rate elevations (notably a pronounced aggregate deviation at 7–8pm, Z = 2.29) point to relatively high evening physiological arousal, which can impede sleep initiation when combined with late bedtimes.

Indicators pointing toward relatively better sleep quality (lower PSQI): The participant shows a number of objective and psychosocial markers that tend to protect sleep. Circadian rhythm measures indicate a robust 24-hour structure: relatively high amplitude (amplitude = 16.02, Z = 1.69) and strong day-to-day consistency (autocorrelation at 24 hours = 0.44, Z = 0.98; interdaily stability Z = 0.58). These features have been associated with better sleep consolidation and lower PSQI (amplitude correlation r ≈ -0.11). The hourly heart-rate profile shows a clear nocturnal trough (large negative deviations across 2–6 AM), consistent with consolidated physiological sleep and normal nighttime autonomic downregulation. Low intradaily variability (0.35; Z = -1.38) suggests relatively little within-day fragmentation of rhythms, another marker that generally aligns with better subjective sleep. Health-supportive behaviors are also present: minimal alcohol and recreational drug use, almost no daily naps, high self-esteem (Rosenberg = 40), and above-average reported happiness (current = 4.0; Z = 0.55) are all features that, in this sample, trend toward lower PSQI or neutral effects.

Integrated assessment and comparison to the study population mean: Weighing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile. Objective circadian robustness, a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate trough, minimal substance use, and positive psychosocial attributes (high self-esteem, modest happiness, strong academic performance) are protective. However, late habitual sleep timing, high night-to-night sleep-duration variability, elevated evening physiological arousal, low exercise, and moderately elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms point toward greater sleep disturbance. Given the balance—protective circadian physiology but psychosocial and behavioral risks that are reasonably strongly associated with PSQI—the overall inference is that this participant’s global sleep quality is likely modestly poorer than the average study participant. Stated relative to the study sample mean PSQI of 6.72 (SD = 2.16), the available multimodal evidence suggests a PSQI level above the population mean (i.e., somewhat worse sleep quality than typical participants), but not extreme—consistent with a small-to-moderate elevation relative to the sample distribution rather than a severe outlier.

Notes on uncertainty: Several important correlational effects in the dataset are modest in magnitude and multiple objective markers point in opposite directions, so this conclusion is probabilistic rather than definitive. The strongest drivers of the above-mean inference are the late and irregular sleep timing and the participant’s trait anxiety/depressive symptom signals; the strongest countervailing evidence is a robust circadian amplitude and clear nocturnal autonomic downregulation captured by wearable heart rate."
