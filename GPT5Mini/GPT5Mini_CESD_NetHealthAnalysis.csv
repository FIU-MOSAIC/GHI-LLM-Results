44869,"Summary of protective features
The participant shows several survey-based and behavioral features that tend to be associated with lower depressive symptoms in this sample. Self-esteem is at the top of the scale (Rosenberg = 40; Z = 0.26), and the self-report trait anxiety score is not elevated (STAI = 39; Z = −0.23). These two measures have strong sample correlations with CES-D in the expected directions (self-esteem r ≈ −0.71; STAI r ≈ +0.82), so the participant’s high self-esteem and lack of elevated trait anxiety are relatively strong protective signals. Additional modestly protective indicators include low reported substance use and a self-rated health satisfaction that is above average (health satisfaction Z = 0.55, correlated negatively with CES-D), and a relatively long median nightly sleep duration (median 8 h 26 min; Z = 1.55), which can be protective when sleep is regular and restorative.

Risk features that point toward higher depressive symptoms
There are several converging physiologic, sleep, and behavioral indicators associated with higher CES-D in this participant. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52), indicating disturbed sleep over the past month — a symptom cluster that correlates with higher depressive scores. Objective sleep is irregular: night-to-night sleep duration variability is very high (SD = 193 min; Z = 2.09) and sleep start time variability is elevated (SD Z = 1.63). Elevated variability in sleep timing and duration is associated in this sample with higher CES-D (sleep timing SD r ≈ +0.21; duration SD r ≈ +0.19). Physiology-based risk signals include an elevated resting heart rate (78.4 bpm; Z = 2.41) and a high MESOR for heart rate (MESOR = 88.34; Z = 1.97), both of which correlate modestly and positively with CES-D (r ≈ +0.19). Circadian-related metrics further suggest reduced rhythmic robustness: amplitude is lower than average (Z = −0.91) and intradaily variability (a measure of fragmentation) is elevated (Z = 1.16). These features (blunted amplitude, higher fragmentation, unstable sleep timing) are commonly associated with greater depressive symptom burden. Behaviorally, the participant reports very high time spent in sedentary hobbies (more than four hours; Z = 3.19) and above-average screen/media time (e.g., TV/videos Z = 1.91), combined with very low frequency of social or group exercise (exercise with others Z = −1.58). These lifestyle patterns are modestly correlated with higher CES-D in the sample and increase the risk profile when combined with poor sleep and elevated resting physiology.

Balanced integration and likely depressive symptom level relative to the sample
When weighing protective and risk features together, the dataset presents a mixed but tilted picture. Strong protective signals (high self-esteem, not-elevated trait anxiety, low substance use, reasonable health satisfaction) reduce the expected depressive symptom score, but a number of objective and subjective signals that are reliably associated with higher CES-D are also present and in several cases pronounced: disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), very high night-to-night sleep variability, elevated resting heart rate and MESOR, low circadian amplitude with increased intradaily variability, and unusually high sedentary hobby time. Several of these risk markers have moderate effect sizes in this sample (notably sleep variability and resting heart rate z-scores > 2; sedentary hobby Z ≈ 3.2), which increases their overall weight in a multimodal inference.

Taking the total pattern into account, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely slightly above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.28). This inference is based on multiple convergent risk indicators of sleep disturbance, circadian fragmentation, elevated cardiovascular baseline, and high sedentary behavior that outweigh — but do not overwhelm — the protective influence of high self-esteem and non-elevated trait anxiety. This is an inferred, probabilistic conclusion (not a direct CES-D score); uncertainty remains because we lack the participant’s explicit CES-D value and because some key correlates (e.g., self-reported happiness and trust) are only modestly shifted.

Notes on interpretation and uncertainty
These conclusions are intended as an integrative, research-oriented interpretation of multimodal signals rather than a clinical diagnosis. Strengths of the inference include concordant objective (wearable) and subjective indicators of disrupted sleep and elevated resting physiology; limitations include the absence of the participant’s explicit CES-D score in the provided data and the fact that some correlations in the sample are modest. If the goal is more precise estimation of depressive symptom level, obtaining the participant’s CES-D score or repeated mood assessments would substantially reduce uncertainty."
92552,"Summary
Over the semester the participant presents a mixed profile of behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived physiological signals. Several features converge on disrupted sleep timing and greater nocturnal physiological arousal, together with elevated trait anxiety—each of which is associated with higher depressive symptom scores in the study sample. At the same time, the participant also reports relatively high self‑esteem, a moderate degree of current happiness, and shows physiological markers (low resting heart rate and average-to-long total sleep duration) that tend to be protective or neutral in relation to depressive symptoms. Taking the whole pattern into account, the participant’s data are most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms that is above the study population mean (population mean CES-D = 13.3), but not at an extreme level (i.e., likely above the mean and more consistent with the upper half of the sample rather than the top quartile).

Features that converge with higher CES‑D risk
- Trait anxiety: The participant’s STAI trait score (45; Z = 0.37) is elevated and the STAI–CES‑D correlation in this sample is very strong (r = 0.81). This makes the anxiety scale one of the most potent contributors in the dataset to an increased likelihood of higher depressive symptoms.  
- Sleep timing irregularity and disturbed subjective sleep: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is 8 (classified as disturbed sleep; Z = 0.59), and the participant’s median sleep start time is very late (about 03:48). Late and irregular sleep timing is associated with worse mood outcomes; sleep start time variability (SD = 94 minutes, positive correlation with CES‑D ~0.22) and a high sleep-duration standard deviation (174 minutes; Z = 1.66; correlation ≈ 0.20) indicate inconsistent sleep across days, which is linked here to higher CES‑D. The participant also shows a modest daily nap frequency (mean 0.22; Z = 1.75) that is positively correlated with CES‑D (≈0.21).  
- Nocturnal physiological arousal: Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show unusually large positive deviations from the mesor in the late-night window (notably 12–3am and the 2–3am value with Z ≈ 4.0 and 16 bpm above the mesor). Nighttime elevations in heart rate (and small positive correlations of these nocturnal windows with CES‑D, up to ~0.16) are consistent with physiological hyperarousal during the hours when most people sleep and are associated in this sample with greater depressive symptoms.  
- Markers of lower health satisfaction and some behavioral patterns: Health satisfaction is below average (Z ≈ -0.78) and the participant reports limited group exercise and relatively little engagement in solitary sedentary hobbies like reading; these contextual lifestyle factors are modestly aligned with increased CES‑D in the sample.

Features that converge with lower CES‑D risk or are neutral
- Self‑esteem and current positive affect: The Rosenberg self‑esteem score is relatively high (Z = 0.82) and correlates negatively with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ -0.71). Current self‑reported happiness (score 4; Z = 0.55; correlation ≈ -0.46) is another significant protective factor. These two self-report indices are among the strongest signals in the data that counterbalance the risk factors described above.  
- Resting and baseline cardiovascular metrics: Resting heart rate and MESOR are both relatively low (resting HR = 48.8 bpm, Z ≈ -1.11; MESOR Z ≈ -1.49). Lower resting cardiac levels are not strongly associated with higher CES‑D in this dataset (correlations modest or positive but small), and in clinical interpretation they often indicate reasonable cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic autonomic arousal, which can mitigate risk.  
- Total sleep duration: Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 49 minutes (Z ≈ 0.79), which is in a typically sufficient range for many adults and is not in itself a strong indicator of greater depressive symptoms in this sample (correlation ≈ 0.0). In other words, although timing and variability are problematic, total sleep time is not consistently reduced and therefore does not strongly push the CES‑D estimate upward.  
- Other lifestyle measures: Alcohol use is somewhat above the sample mean (beer/wine 1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.0) but shows minimal correlation with CES‑D in this dataset; socializing time is near average and therefore not a clear risk or protective factor.

Circadian rhythm and aggregate physiological pattern (integrative)
- Circadian summary features show modest irregularity but not extreme disruption: interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.38, Z ≈ -0.24) and intradaily variability is slightly above average (0.59, Z ≈ 0.32). Amplitude is near the sample mean and acrophase is in the evening (≈ 8:48 PM). Together these non‑extreme circadian metrics indicate some day‑to‑day variability and higher within‑day fragmentation, consistent with irregular sleep timing and intermittent nocturnal activation, but they do not reflect a fully flattened or entirely arrhythmic pattern. Several of these circadian features have small correlations with CES‑D (mostly near zero), suggesting they are contributory but not determinative on their own.

Holistic assessment relative to the study population
Balancing the data, the strongest single signals favoring higher depressive symptoms are elevated trait anxiety (high correlation with CES‑D), subjective sleep disturbance with very late sleep timing and high night-to-night variability, and pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate elevations. Strong signals favoring lower depressive symptoms are relatively high self‑esteem and moderate current happiness, along with normal-to-long total sleep duration and low resting heart rate. Given the relative magnitudes and the very high STAI–CES‑D association in this sample, the composite pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean (13.3), but not at the extreme upper end of the distribution. A reasonable summary statement is that the participant likely falls above the population mean and plausibly in the upper half of the sample distribution (i.e., higher than median/mean but not necessarily above the 75th percentile).

Limitations
These interpretations are based on cross‑sectional correlations and aggregated wearable summaries; causal inferences cannot be made. Some individual metric values (e.g., the absolute self‑esteem score scaling) require careful interpretation in the context of instrument scaling. The hourly heart‑rate deviations are aggregated across the recording period and do not indicate which specific nights or contexts drove nocturnal elevations."
73158,"Summary interpretation
Overall, the multimodal profile for this participant is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.34). Multiple converging self-report and wearable indicators point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden (protective cluster), while a smaller set of behavioral and sleep features suggest some modest risk factors that warrant attention. Below I summarize the main protective and risk signals and then synthesize them into a holistic interpretation.

Protective indicators (tend to predict lower CES‑D)
- Self-report psychological measures: Trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = −1.71) is well below the sample mean and STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81), so this low anxiety score is a substantial protective signal. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg score = 50, Z = 1.66; CES‑D correlation r = −0.71), another strong protective factor. Current happiness is high (score = 5, Z = 1.64; r = −0.46), reinforcing low affective symptom loading. Perceived stress is below average (PSS = 19, Z = −0.71), which also tends to reduce risk.
- Health, lifestyle, and functioning: The participant reports high academic performance (GPAs ~3.9 across terms) and above‑average health satisfaction (5.33, Z = 0.8), both markers of preserved functioning. Substance use is absent, and participation in social exercise is relatively frequent (exercising with others three or more times per week, Z = 1.23), which is generally protective (exercise-with-others correlates negatively with CES‑D, r ≈ −0.23).
- Wearable-derived physiology and circadian integrity: Resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm, Z = −1.18) and the cosinor amplitude is within the typical range (amplitude Z ≈ 0.04). Non‑parametric circadian features indicate relatively low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.44, Z = −0.74) and interdaily stability close to average (0.39, Z = −0.16). The participant’s hourly heart‑rate profile shows a clear day–night contrast with deep nocturnal troughs and robust morning elevation (e.g., 6–7am deviation +14.97, Z = 4.41), consistent with an intact and consolidated circadian rhythm — a pattern usually associated with lower depressive symptomatology.

Risk indicators (tend to predict higher CES‑D or warrant caution)
- Short sleep duration and timing: Median nightly sleep is relatively short (6 h 11 min, Z = −1.25). Although the participant’s PSQI indicates subjectively good sleep (PSQI = 4, Z = −1.26), objectively short sleep duration is a modest risk factor for mood symptoms and for later changes in mood; sleep start time is around 23:35 with some night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 67 minutes).
- Limited engagement in some solitary/leisure activities: The participant reports minimal time in many solitary leisure activities (e.g., listening to music, reading, sedentary hobbies marked as “do not do”), which could reflect lower engagement in individually rewarding activities; correlations between these items and CES‑D in the sample are small, so this is a weak risk indicator rather than a strong one.
- Evening physiology and potential blunting: Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show notably reduced evening/nighttime cardiovascular activation (e.g., 9–11pm and late night hours with negative deviations and Z ≤ −2), which could reflect lower evening arousal. Correlations of these specific hourly values with CES‑D are small, so the signal is subtle rather than decisive.

Circadian and physiological synthesis
The participant shows preserved circadian structure in heart rate: a pronounced nocturnal trough, a strong morning rise (very large positive Z at 6–7am), and a midday acrophase near 1:01 PM. Mesor (mean heart rate) is below the sample mean (65.92, Z = −1.10) and resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm, Z = −1.18). Intraday variability is low (less fragmentation), and interdaily stability is near average. Together, these wearable signatures indicate coherent daily rhythms and relatively low physiological arousal at rest — a profile that, on balance, aligns with lower depressive symptom risk in the sample.

Holistic conclusion and relative placement vs. sample mean
Taking all data together — strong protective self‑report markers (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, low perceived stress), healthy functioning (high GPA, active social exercise, low substance use), and preserved circadian/physiological patterns — the preponderance of evidence supports an inferred CES‑D level below the study population mean of 13.34. The principal countervailing signals (objectively short median sleep duration and limited engagement in some solitary leisure activities, plus subtle evening blunting in heart‑rate deviations) are modest in magnitude and carry weaker correlations with CES‑D in this sample, so they do not outweigh the stronger protective indicators.

Notes and monitoring suggestions (interpretive caveats)
- The inference is probabilistic and relative to the study sample mean rather than a clinical diagnosis. Several objective and subjective measures converge on lower depressive symptom load, but short sleep and some behavioral omissions could represent early or situational risk factors; these would most usefully be monitored over time rather than taken as definitive evidence of elevated depressive symptoms.
- If longitudinal change is of interest, tracking objective sleep duration and variability, engagement in rewarding solitary activities, and any increase in trait anxiety or reductions in self‑esteem would be informative because these features could presage increases in CES‑D scores.

In summary: the multimodal profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean (i.e., relatively low symptom burden), with isolated, modest risk cues (short sleep duration and limited solitary leisure engagement) that warrant routine monitoring rather than immediate concern."
45963,"Summary and overall inference:
Taken together, the pattern of self-report and wearable-derived metrics indicates that this participant’s depressive symptom level is most consistent with being above the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.28). Several high-weighted psychosocial measures that correlate strongly with CES-D (notably trait anxiety and self‑esteem) and multiple indicators of sleep and circadian dysregulation provide converging evidence for elevated symptom burden relative to the sample. This inference is probabilistic and based on associations; it does not constitute a clinical diagnosis.

Factors in the data that are consistent with relatively higher CES‑D scores:
- High trait anxiety (STAI = 62; Z = 2.05) is a strong signal. The STAI score shows a large positive correlation with CES‑D in the study data (r ≈ 0.81), making it one of the most influential single predictors present.  
- Low self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 30; Z = −1.15) has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71), which similarly points toward greater depressive symptomatology.  
- Low current happiness (self-rated = 2.0; Z = −1.61) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 24; Z = 0.65) are additional self-report features that align with higher CES‑D (happiness r ≈ −0.46; stress r ≈ 0.28).  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep) combined with objective sleep schedule irregularity (median sleep start ≈ 01:56 AM and very high sleep start SD; Z = 2.89) indicate poor and inconsistent sleep timing. Sleep disturbance and irregular sleep timing are known to be associated with higher depressive symptoms and the dataset shows modest positive correlations between sleep variability and CES‑D.  
- Wearable circadian metrics showing markedly low interdaily stability (0.16; Z = −2.06) and low circadian amplitude (amplitude = 4.2; Z = −2.13) indicate reduced day‑to‑day regularity and blunted diurnal variation in heart‑rate rhythm. These features—circadian irregularity and blunted amplitude—are mechanistically and empirically linked to elevated mood symptoms and in this dataset align with higher CES‑D.  
- Elevated resting and average heart‑rate level (resting HR = 68.2 bpm; MESOR Z ≈ +1.07, resting HR Z ≈ +1.2) provide physiological evidence of higher baseline autonomic arousal, which in this sample correlates positively with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19).  
- Low satisfaction with physical health (Z ≈ −1.28) and a BMI in the overweight range also align with the pattern of higher symptom burden (health satisfaction correlates negatively with CES‑D, r ≈ −0.39).

Factors in the data that are consistent with relatively lower CES‑D scores:
- Objective sleep quantity is not extremely low: median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 40 min (Z ≈ −0.64), which is slightly below but near the study mean rather than grossly short. The participant has few naps (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08), which reduces the likelihood that daytime hypersomnolence is a dominant issue. These aspects mitigate, to some extent, the risk implied by sleep timing irregularity.  
- Engagement in structured activity and functioning indicators are relatively preserved: academic performance is high (GPAs consistently ≈ 3.6–3.98), and the participant reports participating in exercise with others and sports about 1–2 times per week—behaviors that, in this sample, tend to be associated with lower CES‑D.  
- Substance use and recreational drug use are minimal, which reduces one potential contributor to depressive symptoms.  
- Some wearable activity measures (for example, intradaily variability is low, Z ≈ −1.09) do not show patterns typical of marked rest–activity fragmentation; however, intradaily variability here correlates weakly and negatively with CES‑D in the sample, so its protective implication is limited.

Integrated interpretation and relative weighting:
The strongest single pieces of evidence in this case are the high trait anxiety and low self‑esteem, both of which have large study‑level correlations with CES‑D and are substantially deviant from the sample means (Z ≈ +2.05 and Z ≈ −1.15, respectively). These psychosocial signals are reinforced by disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5) and marked objective circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability and very low amplitude of heart‑rate rhythm), which together form a coherent pattern commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Physiologic indicators of higher baseline autonomic tone (elevated MESOR and resting HR) add further, though smaller, corroboration. Countervailing evidence (reasonable total sleep duration, preserved academic functioning, some social/exercise engagement, low substance use) reduces the likelihood that severe, global impairment is present, but these do not outweigh the stronger signals listed above.

Final statement comparing to the population mean:
On balance, the multimodal data indicate a level of depressive symptoms that is likely above the study population mean CES‑D score of 13.28. The inference rests primarily on high trait anxiety and low self‑esteem—measures with the largest correlations to CES‑D in this dataset—together with objective markers of circadian and sleep timing disruption and elevated baseline heart rate. Limitations include cross‑sectional associations, temporally aggregated heart‑rate summaries, and the fact that CES‑D was not directly provided here; therefore, this conclusion should be interpreted as a probabilistic risk assessment rather than a definitive measure."
22138,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of risk and protective signals for depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety and perceived stress are notably elevated, whereas objective sleep quantity, several circadian rhythm metrics, regular exercise with others, and academic functioning appear relatively favorable. When the available measures are weighed together, the balance of evidence suggests depressive symptom severity that is at or modestly above the study population mean (population mean CES-D = 13.3), but not clearly extreme; results should be interpreted as an intermediate level with mixed indicators rather than a definitive classification.

Factors consistent with relatively higher depressive symptom levels: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86), a variable that in this sample correlates strongly with CES-D (r = 0.81), making it the single strongest signal pointing toward higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65; correlation with CES-D = 0.28), and current self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53; correlation with CES-D = -0.46), both of which align with increased symptom burden. Low interpersonal trust (Z = -0.78, correlation with CES-D = -0.41) and relatively greater time spent on internet use and sedentary hobbies (internet Z = 0.85; sedentary hobby Z = 0.82; both modestly positively correlated with CES-D) further point in the same direction. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:15) and sleep onset timing is somewhat irregular (sleep start SD 121 minutes, Z = 0.83), and timing irregularity has a small positive correlation with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.22 for start-time SD), suggesting behavioral patterns that can be associated with higher symptoms. Finally, several wearable-derived cardiovascular indices show modest positive associations with symptom level (e.g., mesor and resting heart rate have positive correlations ~0.19), consistent with a pattern of somewhat elevated physiological arousal.

Factors consistent with relatively lower depressive symptom levels: The participant reports generally adequate and fairly regular sleep duration (median 7 h 32 min, Z = 0.43) and a PSQI score of 5 (Z = -0.8), indicating subjectively acceptable sleep quality relative to the sample; sleep-duration SD is lower than average (82 min, Z = -0.43), and mean daily naps are essentially absent (Z = -0.86), both of which are protective in this sample. Objective circadian rhythm features derived from heart rate also look robust: amplitude is relatively high (amplitude Z = 0.73), interdaily stability is modestly above average (Z = 0.50), and intradaily variability is lower than average (Z = -0.53). Those rhythm properties (higher amplitude and stability, lower fragmentation) are typically associated with fewer depressive symptoms in group-level analyses. Behavioral functioning indicators also suggest resilience: the participant reports exercising with others three or more times per week (Z = 1.23), a social and active behavior linked to lower symptom scores here (exercise-with-others correlation r = -0.23), and academic performance is high (GPAs in the high 3.6–3.9 range), indicating preserved cognitive and role functioning. Self-esteem is higher than the sample mean (self-esteem Z = 0.54), and in this dataset self-esteem correlates negatively with CES-D (r = -0.71), which is a strong protective factor.

Integration and conclusion: Several of the strongest single predictors in this dataset pull in opposite directions: trait anxiety (high and strongly predictive of higher CES-D) argues for symptom levels above the sample mean, while protective factors with substantial predictive weight—adequate sleep duration/quality, robust circadian rhythm metrics, frequent social exercise, and higher self-esteem—argue for lower symptom levels. Given the particularly strong correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D and the participant’s elevated STAI score, the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels that are near to moderately above the study population mean rather than markedly below it or at an extreme high. In summary: relative to the sample mean CES-D of 13.3, the participant’s inferred symptom level is best described as near or slightly above the population mean, reflecting a mixed profile of notable anxiety/stress risk alongside multiple behavioral and physiological supports."
31439,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms:
Several self-report and physiological metrics point toward features that, in the study sample, are associated with greater depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 49; z ≈ 0.76) and the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81), making this one of the most salient risk signals. The participant reports clinically meaningful sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score = 6; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), and wearable sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration below the sample mean (6 h 41 min; z ≈ −0.61) with substantial night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD = 110 minutes). Perceived stress is above the sample mean (PSS = 23; z ≈ 0.38; r ≈ 0.28), and self‑reported current happiness is lower than average (Happy = 3.0; z ≈ −0.53; r ≈ −0.46). Lower interpersonal trust (score = 2.5; z ≈ −1.42; r ≈ −0.41) also aligns with higher CES‑D in this sample. Physiologically, resting heart rate and MESOR are elevated (RHR = 78.2 bpm; MESOR = 91.4; both z ≈ 2.38), and MESOR shows a small positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), which together suggest higher tonic cardiovascular arousal that, in the sample, modestly associates with greater depressive symptoms. Finally, several behavioral markers (disturbed sleep, elevated trait anxiety, and reduced subjective well‑being) together are typically linked to higher CES‑D scores.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms:
At the same time, the dataset contains multiple markers associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Global self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg Self‑Esteem = 39; z ≈ 0.11) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ −0.71), a robust protective factor against depressive symptoms. Academic functioning appears intact (GPAs in the mid‑3.4–3.7 range), and daily social and recreational engagement is present (socializing ~1–2 hours, some exercise alone and with others ~1–2 times per week). Wearable circadian regularity is not markedly disrupted: interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.44; z ≈ 0.25) and 24‑hour autocorrelation is elevated (0.40; z ≈ 0.64), indicating a reasonably consistent day‑to‑day rhythm. Intradaily variability is lower than typical (0.37; z ≈ −1.24), which can reflect consolidated periods of activity and rest rather than frequent fragmentation. Low mean daily nap frequency (≈0.07; z ≈ −0.08) and limited use of recreational drugs are additional behavioral signs that can be protective in this sample.

Circadian and physiological synthesis:
The heart‑rate–based circadian profile shows a relatively high MESOR with reduced amplitude (amplitude = 9.24; z ≈ −0.50), producing a profile of elevated baseline cardiac activity and somewhat blunted day–night difference. This combination—higher MESOR/RHR and lower amplitude—has been associated in other work with sympathetic predominance or reduced circadian contrast and can relate to mood symptoms; in the present sample MESOR is modestly positively correlated with CES‑D while amplitude has a small negative correlation. Nighttime heart‑rate dips are present (hourly deviations of ~−14 bpm during the 2–5 AM window), which indicates preserved nocturnal lowering of cardiovascular activity on average, and the acrophase at ~4:05 PM is within a typical late‑afternoon peak. Overall, wearable circadian measures suggest a relatively regular daily schedule (moderate interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation) but with physiological signs of increased tonic arousal (elevated resting heart rate and MESOR) and somewhat blunted amplitude—features that provide mixed signals for depressive symptom risk.

Holistic assessment relative to the study sample:
Balancing the convergent lines of evidence, the participant shows a mix of risk and protective factors. The most influential risk signals are elevated trait anxiety (strongly associated with higher CES‑D), disturbed subjective sleep, elevated perceived stress, lower reported happiness and trust, and chronically elevated resting heart rate/MESOR. The strongest protective signal is high self‑esteem (strong inverse correlation with CES‑D), along with preserved daytime structure (reasonable interdaily stability, low intradaily fragmentation), intact academic performance, and some social/exercise engagement. Considering the relative magnitude of these factors and their correlations with CES‑D in this sample, the overall pattern is more consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.3). This conclusion is probabilistic and graded—there are clear protective strengths that mitigate risk—so a best summary is that the participant’s multimodal profile indicates a higher‑than‑average burden of depressive symptoms compared with the sample mean, rather than an extreme or deterministic level."
46558,"Summary statement
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a pattern of several protective markers (relatively high current happiness, higher self-esteem, generally good subjective sleep and health satisfaction, and a reasonably regular heart‑rate circadian rhythm) alongside a small set of behavioral risk markers (very low exercise and elevated sedentary / video‑game time, and a late median sleep onset). Integrating these cues, the balance of evidence points toward depressive symptom levels that are likely below the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.3), though not uniformly low and with some behavioral features that could modestly elevate risk.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES-D symptom burden
- Positive affect and self‑evaluation: The participant’s self‑reported current happiness is substantially above the sample mean (Happy Z = +1.64) and Rosenberg self‑esteem is above average (score 35, Z = -0.45 relative to the study distribution but the score itself is in the upper range of the scale). Given strong negative correlations between self‑esteem and CES‑D (reported correlation ≈ -0.71) and a moderate negative correlation between happiness and CES‑D (≈ -0.46), these self‑reports are robust indicators consistent with lower depressive symptoms. 
- Sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality: Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration (7 h 5 m, Z ≈ -0.12) and a PSQI total score at the clinical cutoff (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8, classified as “Good Sleep”) suggest generally adequate sleep duration and subjectively acceptable sleep quality. Low mean daily naps (0.0, Z = -0.86) and relatively low night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD = 58 minutes, Z = -0.98) further point to consistent sleep patterns, which are typically protective with respect to mood symptoms.
- Circadian regularity and physiological rhythm structure: Heart‑rate circadian features show relatively high interdaily stability (0.51, Z = +0.83) and a positive 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.41, Z = +0.73), indicating consistent day‑to‑day timing of activity/arousal. Intradaily variability is modest (0.59, Z = +0.32) and amplitude and mesor are near the sample mean. These features, together with no elevated resting heart rate (60.7 bpm, Z ≈ +0.3), indicate an organized circadian/physiological profile that typically corresponds with lower depressive symptomatology or resilience to mood disruption.
- Other protective markers: Relatively high health satisfaction (Z ≈ +0.8), low substance use, and some social time (socializing 2–3 hours, Z ≈ +0.95) are additional factors that typically relate to lower CES‑D scores.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES-D symptom burden
- Low physical activity and high sedentary recreation: The participant reports very infrequent exercise (exercised alone: less than 1–2 times a month, Z ≈ -1.18; exercised with others: not at all, Z ≈ -1.58) and high sedentary leisure, especially video‑game use (2–3 hours, Z ≈ +3.23) and other sedentary hobbies (2–3 hours, Z ≈ +2.01). Although correlations between these specific items and CES‑D are modest in the sample, limited physical activity and prolonged sedentary time are well‑documented behavioral risk factors for elevated depressive symptoms and may act to increase vulnerability over time.
- Late sleep timing: The median sleep start time is relatively late (01:14 AM). Late chronotype or delayed sleep timing can be associated with mood symptoms in some individuals; although total sleep duration and sleep regularity here appear adequate, later sleep timing can still relate to mood disturbance and social rhythm misalignment in some contexts.
- Perceived stress and other small risk signals: The participant’s perceived stress is slightly above the sample mean (PSS = 22, Z ≈ +0.1) and correlates positively with CES‑D (≈ +0.28). Several wearable correlates with CES‑D are small but point in risk directions (some overnight HR deviations and sleep timing variability show weak positive correlations with CES‑D), suggesting the potential for modest symptom burden under stress or sustained unhealthy behavioral patterns.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the stronger protective signals (notably high self‑reported happiness, relatively high self‑esteem, adequate sleep duration and quality, and a structured circadian heart‑rate rhythm) against the behavioral risk factors (very low exercise, high sedentary/video‑game time, and late sleep timing), the preponderance of evidence suggests that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D score of 13.3. This inference is supported by several high‑weight indicators that have strong sample correlations with CES‑D (especially self‑esteem and reported happiness) and by circadian regularity measures that tend to align with lower symptom burden. However, the behavioral risk pattern (especially the marked sedentary recreation and minimal exercise) represents a plausible pathway by which depressive symptoms could increase over time; thus the participant may be at some behavioral risk despite current relative protection.

Caveats
This is a multimodal, probabilistic interpretation rather than a diagnostic statement. Correlations provided in the dataset are helpful for weighting cues but are modest for many wearable metrics; therefore conclusions should be treated as provisional and ideally triangulated with a direct CES‑D score or clinical assessment if available. Behavioral targets that could further reduce risk include increasing frequency of physical activity and reducing prolonged sedentary recreational time."
93699,"Evidence pointing toward relatively elevated depressive symptoms
Several self-report indicators that show moderate-to-strong associations with CES-D are elevated or shifted in a direction that commonly accompanies higher depressive symptom scores. Trait anxiety (STAI = 44, z = 0.27) is a particularly strong marker here: in this dataset the STAI–Trait score correlates highly with CES-D (r = 0.82), which makes the participant’s anxious-trait score a salient predictor of elevated depressive symptoms. Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg = 35, z = -0.45; r with CES-D = -0.71), lower current happiness (score = 3, z = -0.53; r = -0.46), and lower health satisfaction (z ≈ -1.11; r = -0.39) likewise align with established CES-D correlates and point toward greater symptom burden. Subjective sleep complaints are pronounced (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep), which commonly co-occurs with and predicts higher CES-D scores. Behavioral patterns associated with higher CES-D are also present: high daily internet use (>4 hours, z = 2.19, r = 0.26), relatively low in-person socializing (z = -0.62), limited solitary exercise frequency, and a higher BMI (28.7) — each of these has either a direct positive correlation with CES-D or is consistent with higher symptomatology in the literature. Wearable-derived physiological signals that weakly favor higher CES-D include a modestly elevated mesor and resting heart rate (mesor 79.36, z = 0.74; resting HR 64.8, z = 0.79; r ≈ 0.19), suggesting slightly higher baseline cardiovascular arousal that is associated (albeit weakly) with depressive symptom scores in this sample.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
Multiple wearable-derived and behavioral features provide countervailing evidence that would be expected to relate to lower CES-D scores. The participant shows reasonably regular circadian cardiac rhythms: interdaily stability (0.51, z = 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.42, z = 0.81) are above average, and intradaily variability is near the sample mean (0.53, z ≈ -0.11). These patterns indicate a preserved day–night structure in physiological activity (clear nocturnal heart-rate dips and daytime peaks), which is typically associated with lower depressive symptom severity. Median sleep duration (~6 h 51 min, z = -0.42) is only modestly below the sample mean and the participant reports essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0, z = -0.86), both of which are more consistent with typical sleep behavior than with severe hypersomnia or fragmentation. Social exercise (exercising with others 1–2 times per week, z = 0.53) and low recreational drug/non-prescribed drug use are also protective behavioral features. Notably, perceived stress is reported as lower than the study sample mean (PSS score = 13, z = -2.34), which—if this low perceived stress is accurate—would be a factor associated with lower CES-D scores (though the PSS–CES-D correlation is only modest).

Integrated interpretation and position relative to the study population mean
Taking the full multimodal profile together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.32). The strongest, most CES-D–predictive signals in the data are psychological and subjective: elevated trait anxiety (r = 0.82), reduced self-esteem (r = -0.71), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI high), reduced reported happiness (r = -0.46), and behavioral markers such as heavy internet use and limited social engagement. These psychosocial and subjective sleep indicators are more strongly linked to CES-D in this dataset than the wearable-derived protective features (circadian stability, typical sleep duration, no naps), so they dominate the overall inference. Thus, while physiology and daily-activity regularity mitigate risk to some degree, the preponderance of self-report signals indicates a symptomatic level that is plausibly above the sample mean rather than near or below it.

Limitations and recommended next steps
This inference is probabilistic and based on associations in the provided variables; correlations do not establish causation and the wearable measures are aggregated across days. The dataset does not include the participant’s actual CES-D numeric score; a confirmatory CES-D administration or a structured clinical interview would be required to quantify current depressive symptom severity precisely. Given the combination of elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep, and behavioral markers (high internet use, low social contact), targeted follow-up (e.g., assessment of mood symptoms over the past two weeks, sleep-focused questions, and functional impact) would be appropriate to clarify current need for intervention or support."
84011,"Factors in the record that are most consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology center on trait anxiety, lower self-regard, aspects of sleep disturbance, and limited interpersonal trust and social contact. The participant’s STAI–Trait score (44, Z = 0.27) is in the anxious range and the STAI–CES-D correlation in this sample is large (r = 0.82), so this elevated anxiety proneness is a strong indicator that CES-D score may be higher than average. Rosenberg self‑esteem is below the study mean (score = 33, Z = −0.73) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r = −0.71), which likewise suggests greater depressive symptoms when considered with anxiety. The PSQI score (6) crosses the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep, and lower interpersonal trust (score Z = −0.78; trust–CES‑D r = −0.41) together with relatively little time spent socializing (socializing Z = −1.41) provide additional behavioral signals that align with higher CES‑D in this participant.

Conversely, multiple features point toward reduced depressive symptom burden or resilience relative to the study population. The participant reports a relatively high current happiness rating (4.0, Z = 0.55) and above‑average satisfaction with health (Z = 0.55), both of which are associated with lower CES‑D in the sample (happiness–CES‑D r = −0.46; health satisfaction r = −0.39). Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS = 20, Z = −0.44), and substance use is minimal; both are protective. The participant also reports frequent organized physical activity (exercising with others Z = 1.23; sports Z = 1.58), and these exercise metrics have modest negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ −0.15 to −0.23), which would be expected to mitigate depressive symptoms. Academically the participant’s GPAs are high, which may reflect functioning that is inconsistent with severe symptomatic impairment.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology give a mixed picture. Objective sleep duration is long relative to the sample (median 8 h 28 min, Z = 1.59) with low nap frequency; long sleep can reflect good rest for some individuals but can also be present in depressive presentations — in this dataset median sleep duration itself shows no association with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.0). Circadian stability measures show modest irregularity: interdaily stability is below average (Z ≈ −0.49) while intradaily variability is elevated (Z ≈ 1.02), suggesting less consistent day‑to‑day structure and more within‑day fragmentation of heart‑rate rhythms. These rhythm irregularities are only weakly associated with CES‑D in the sample (correlations near zero), so they should be considered supportive but not definitive. Heart‑rate profile shows low resting rate and low mesor (RHR = 51.4, mesor Z = −1.48), with pronounced daytime heart‑rate elevations at a few late‑day hours (e.g., strong positive deviations at 8–9 pm, Z = 2.19). The aggregated hourly deviations do not show strong correlations with CES‑D overall, but the pattern of elevated late‑day arousal and irregular circadian structure could be relevant to mood and sleep timing for this individual.

Balancing these sources of evidence, there is a mixture of risk and protective signals. Strong predictors of higher CES‑D include elevated trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem, disturbed subjective sleep, and reduced interpersonal trust and socializing; protective signals include lower perceived stress, higher reported happiness and health satisfaction, frequent organized exercise, minimal substance use, and preserved daytime functioning (e.g., academic performance). Considering the relative magnitude of the strongest indicators (notably the high STAI–CES‑D correlation and the large self‑esteem–CES‑D correlation), the overall profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels near or modestly above the study sample mean rather than with markedly low or very high CES‑D scores. In the study’s statistical context (population mean CES‑D = 13.33, SD = 9.61; median = 11.5), the participant’s multimodal pattern suggests a CES‑D level around the population mean or slightly above it; this conclusion is probabilistic and should be interpreted alongside direct symptom measurement and clinical context.

Limitations and caveats: correlations cited here are sample‑level associations and do not determine an individual’s score. Wearable circadian metrics are summary aggregates and do not replace symptom interviews. If an accurate CES‑D score is required for decision‑making, use the participant’s direct CES‑D self‑report or a clinical assessment."
88008,"Summary of self-report indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile contains a mix of risk- and resilience-related signals. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 48; z ≈ +0.66) and has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the study sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most salient predictors of higher depressive symptoms in this case. Self‑esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 33; z ≈ −0.73) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which also points toward increased depressive symptom burden. Subjective happiness is lower than average (current happiness z ≈ −0.53), and measures of interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are below the sample mean (both z ≈ −0.7 to −0.8), each of which is associated in the sample with modest relationships to CES‑D in the direction that would increase risk. Conversely, perceived stress is slightly below the sample mean (PSS z ≈ −0.44), and substance use is minimal; both of these features are more consistent with lower CES‑D scores.

Wearable-derived sleep, activity, and circadian features:
Objective wearable metrics indicate generally regular and relatively robust circadian structure. The cosinor amplitude is elevated (amplitude z ≈ +1.48) and intradaily variability is low (IV z ≈ −1.73), suggesting strong day–night differentiation and low fragmentation of heart‑rate–based rhythms; in the study correlations these rhythm measures show weak or slightly negative associations with CES‑D, implying a modest protective effect. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are above average (z ≈ +0.7 to +0.9), consistent with regular daily patterns. Resting heart rate is relatively low (≈55 bpm, z ≈ −0.36); in the sample a higher resting heart rate showed a small positive correlation with CES‑D, so this lower value would be protective. Wearable sleep totals are on the short side (median nightly sleep ≈ 6 h 9 min; z ≈ −1.29) and sleep start times are late (median ~1:14 AM), but sleep duration’s sample correlation with CES‑D is effectively null here; subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, z ≈ −0.8) is classified as “good,” which is a protective self‑report indicator.

Factors pointing toward higher depressive symptoms:
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI; strong positive correlation with CES‑D).
- Lower self‑esteem (RSES; strong inverse correlation with CES‑D).
- Lower self‑reported happiness and lower interpersonal trust and health satisfaction (moderate associations with higher CES‑D).
- Late habitual sleep onset and objectively short median sleep duration can be associated with mood symptoms in other literature, and here they are present even if their sample correlations with CES‑D are small or null.

Factors pointing toward lower depressive symptoms:
- Strong, regular circadian structure: high amplitude, low intradaily variability, and above‑average interdaily stability — features associated (in this sample) with either no relationship or small inverse relationships to CES‑D.
- Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI at or below the sample mean).
- Frequent exercise and low substance use, both of which are associated with lower depressive symptoms in many samples.
- Low resting heart rate and limited daytime napping, which in this dataset relate weakly to lower CES‑D.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample:
Balancing the evidence, the most weighty indicators in this profile are the psychological trait scores (notably elevated trait anxiety and reduced self‑esteem), both of which have strong sample correlations with CES‑D and therefore increase the likelihood that this participant’s depressive symptom level is above the sample average. Objective physiological and behavioral markers (regular circadian rhythms, strong amplitude, low fragmentation, frequent exercise, and good subjective sleep quality) provide meaningful protective context and reduce the likelihood of very high symptom burden. Taking these factors together, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is best characterized as somewhat above the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.29, SD = 9.62), rather than markedly elevated; uncertainty remains because objective protective features moderate risk signaled by trait measures."
83566,"Summary conclusion
Based on the available self-report and wearable-derived indicators, the participant’s overall pattern of symptoms and physiology is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.24). This judgment gives particular weight to very elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and low self-esteem—measures that both show strong correlations with CES-D in this sample—and is balanced against several behavioral and circadian features that are comparatively neutral or mildly protective.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms
The participant reports pronounced trait anxiety (STAI = 62; Z = +2.05), and the STAI–CES-D correlation in this sample is very high (r = 0.81). This is a strong indicator that depressive symptom burden is likely elevated. Low self-esteem (Rosenberg = 29; Z = −1.29) is also strongly associated with higher CES-D scores in this dataset (r = −0.71), and together these two trait measures provide the most compelling evidence for above-mean depressive symptoms. Additional self-report indices that support this interpretation include low current happiness (score = 2; Z = −1.61) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 24; Z = +0.65), both of which have nontrivial associations with depressive symptoms in the study sample. Physiologically, resting heart rate (69.4 bpm; Z = +1.34) and an elevated mesor for hourly heart rate (84.83; Z = +1.49) are modestly positively associated with CES-D here (r ≈ 0.18), consistent with increased autonomic arousal that often accompanies affective distress.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower or neutral depressive symptoms
Several objective behavioral and circadian metrics are neutral or modestly protective. Sleep duration is relatively long and consistent (median = 8 h 8 min; Z = +1.18; sleep-duration SD = 65 minutes; Z = −0.82), and there are essentially no reported naps (mean daily naps = 0; Z = −0.86). Circadian regularity metrics are near or slightly above average: interdaily stability is close to the mean (0.42; Z = +0.09), autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Z = +0.90), and intradaily variability is only slightly above average (Z = +0.24). These objective markers of regular sleep–wake or heart-rate rhythm structure tend not to index high depression in this sample (little or mixed correlation with CES-D). The participant also reports no alcohol or recreational drug use, which can be a protective behavioral factor relative to peers. Finally, some wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show a normal nocturnal decline and an afternoon acrophase (~4:51 PM), consistent with an intact diurnal rhythm overall.

Reconciling conflicting indicators
There is a notable discrepancy between subjective and objective sleep indicators: PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI = 8; Z = +0.59), while wearable measures show adequate and regular total sleep time. This pattern suggests subjective sleep problems (difficulty falling asleep, perceived poor sleep quality or nonrestorative sleep) despite objectively adequate duration—an experience commonly reported in anxiety and depressive presentations and one that can amplify distress even when duration is sufficient. Behavioral inactivity is also evident (very low exercise frequency, minimal socializing and recreational activities), which can contribute to or maintain low mood even if objective circadian structure is not severely disrupted.

Overall integrated interpretation relative to the study sample
Given the very large weight of trait anxiety (Z = +2.05, r with CES-D = 0.81) together with low self-esteem (Z = −1.29, r = −0.71) and low self-reported happiness (Z = −1.61), the balance of evidence favors an inference that this participant’s CES-D score would be above the sample mean of 13.24. Objective wearable signals (regular circadian structure, sufficient sleep duration) temper but do not outweigh the strong self-report indicators that most strongly predict CES-D in this cohort. Therefore, the most defensible conclusion is that the participant’s depressive symptom level is above the population mean, although the presence of intact circadian regularity and objective sleep quantity suggest a mixed profile rather than severe disruption across all domains.

Limitations
This interpretation is inferential: no participant CES-D raw score is provided here, and correlations are population-level associations that do not deterministically map an individual’s score. Wearable measures and self-report can disagree (as they do for sleep), and causal direction cannot be established from cross-sectional associations. These caveats should be considered when using this analysis for screening or clinical decision-making."
87032,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a constellation of psychological self-report and wearable-derived physiological patterns that, when considered together, point toward elevated depressive symptomatology relative to the study sample. Multiple high-weight indicators (notably trait anxiety and disturbed sleep) that have strong empirical correlations with CES-D scores are present alongside behavioral and circadian features (low activity, irregular rhythms, elevated resting heart rate, late/variable sleep timing) that are typically associated with greater depressive symptoms. A smaller set of features (moderately preserved self-esteem, reasonable academic performance, some social time) provide limited countervailing evidence. Taken holistically, the pattern is most consistent with an overall CES-D level above the population mean of 13.27.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score of 44 (Z = 0.27) is elevated and is strongly correlated with CES-D in this dataset (correlation = 0.82). Because trait anxiety is one of the strongest correlates of depressive symptoms here, this single measure substantially increases the expectation of elevated CES-D.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and sleep timing variability: The PSQI score of 10 (Z = 1.52, classified as disturbed sleep) indicates notable subjective sleep problems; PSQI elevations are commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Wearable sleep data reinforce sleep-related risk: median sleep duration is modestly short (6 h 43 min, Z = -0.58) and sleep start time is very late (median ~02:00) with large night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.36). These features—late, variable, and subjectively poor sleep—are frequently linked to higher CES-D scores.
- Stress, reduced positive affect, and behavioral inactivity: Perceived stress is high (PSS = 26, Z = 1.19), current self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (score 3.0, Z = -0.53, correlation with CES-D ≈ -0.46), and the participant reports virtually no exercise or sports (large negative Zs for exercise), which together are behavioral patterns associated with greater depressive symptoms.
- Sedentary and solitary activities: High time spent on internet use and listening to music (Z > 2) and several sedentary recreation measures (e.g., watching TV 2–3 hours, Z = 1.91) are present; these behaviors in this sample correlate modestly with higher CES-D (correlations ≈ 0.12–0.25) and thus add further risk signal.
- Physiological arousal and circadian dysregulation: Resting heart rate and MESOR are elevated (resting HR = 69.4 bpm, Z = 1.34; MESOR = 85.35, Z = 1.56) and the circadian activity measures indicate reduced regularity (low interdaily stability Z = -1.15, low autocorrelation at 24h Z = -1.87) with elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.44). Elevated resting heart rate and blunted/irregular day–night rhythm are modestly associated with higher CES-D in these data (resting HR correlation ≈ 0.19), supporting the pattern of greater physiological stress/arousal and circadian disruption often seen with depressive symptoms.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Self-esteem and academic functioning: The Rosenberg self-esteem score (36, Z = -0.31) is somewhat lower than the sample mean but remains at a level that is not severely reduced; self-esteem has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (≈ -0.71), and the participant’s score is not at an extreme low. Academic performance (GPAs ~3.44–3.50 across terms) is solid, which can reflect preserved cognitive/functional capacity and is protective against severe functional impairment.
- Some social engagement and modest health satisfaction: The participant reports 1–2 hours of socializing with friends (Z ≈ 0.16) and health satisfaction scores are not extremely low (Z ≈ -0.53). These factors can exert modest protective effects against higher depressive symptoms.
- Weak or mixed wearable–CES-D associations: Several wearable circadian metrics have small or near-zero correlations with CES-D in the study (e.g., interdaily stability corr ≈ 0.0; intradaily variability corr ≈ -0.06), indicating that while the participant’s rhythms are irregular relative to the sample, the direct predictive strength of some of these objective metrics for CES-D is limited in this dataset and should be weighted accordingly.

Circadian and physiological detail and interpretation
- The wearable hourly heart rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations, but overall mesor and resting heart rate are elevated relative to the sample (Zs > 1.3), consistent with higher basal autonomic arousal. The participant’s acrophase is mid/late afternoon (4:28 PM), which is within a plausible active-day window, but the low interdaily stability and low 24h autocorrelation indicate weak day-to-day consistency in rhythm. Sleep timing is delayed and highly variable (median bed ~02:00 with SD ~145 minutes), and naps are somewhat more frequent than average (mean daily naps Z = 1.27). Together these objective markers describe a circadian profile marked by irregular timing and increased physiological arousal—features often associated with increased depressive symptom burden, even though some circadian metrics show modest direct correlations with CES-D in this sample.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
- Balancing the evidence, the profile contains several high-weight signals associated with higher CES-D—most notably elevated trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D), clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance, elevated perceived stress, low exercise, and elevated resting heart rate—while protective signals (moderately preserved self-esteem, intact academic performance, some social time) are weaker or less decisive. Given these converging indicators, the participant’s depressive symptom level is most consistent with being above the study population mean CES-D score of 13.27 and likely above the median (11.0). There is reasonable likelihood that their CES-D would fall in the upper half of the sample distribution and could approach the upper quartile, although exact placement cannot be determined without a direct CES-D score.
- Uncertainties and caveats: Correlations in the dataset vary in magnitude and do not establish causation; wearable measures are aggregate and not date-specific; several objective circadian metrics have only weak associations with CES-D in this sample. Therefore, while the balance of evidence favors an above-mean level of depressive symptoms, this inference should be treated as probabilistic rather than definitive and interpreted alongside clinical assessment or a direct CES-D measurement if accurate diagnostic or clinical decisions are required."
94641,"Summary of symptom-relevant self-report signals
Several self-report indicators that are strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms in this sample are present. The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI = 54; Z = +1.25) — a measure that correlates highly with CES‑D in this dataset (r = 0.81) and therefore contributes substantial weight to an inference of greater depressive symptomatology. Self‑esteem is comparatively low (RSES = 32; Z = −0.87) and has a large negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = −0.71), which again points toward higher depressive symptom burden. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10; Z = +1.52, classified as disturbed sleep), a pattern that is commonly associated with higher CES‑D scores. Additional psychosocial indicators compatible with higher depressive symptoms include low health satisfaction (Z = −1.61) and minimal socializing (≈15 minutes or less; Z = −2.20), both of which have sample-level relationships with CES‑D consistent with increased symptoms.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors that weigh toward higher CES‑D
Behavioral patterns that further align with elevated depressive symptoms include minimal reported exercise (no regular exercise; Zs −1.93 to −1.58 for exercise items), high sedentary hobby time ( >4 hours; Z = +3.19), and greater-than-average daily napping (mean daily naps = 0.3; Z = +2.66). Objective sleep estimates show relatively short median nightly sleep (6 h 15 min; Z = −1.15) combined with high night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD = 168 minutes; Z = +1.52). These sleep quantity/regularity findings and the high napping frequency are consistent with behavioral patterns often observed with higher depressive symptom scores in this population (several sleep-related metrics show positive correlations with CES‑D in the dataset).

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian evidence
Physiological metrics present a mixed but moderately concerning picture. Resting heart rate and mean mesor are elevated relative to the study sample (resting HR = 70.3 bpm, Z = +1.44; MESOR = 83.09, Z = +1.25), and both have modest positive correlations with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting a pattern of higher baseline autonomic arousal that is associated with greater depressive symptoms in this sample. Circadian regularity metrics are not uniformly adverse: interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.42; Z = +0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Z = +1.15), indicating reasonably consistent day‑to‑day timing of the heart‑rate rhythm — a feature that is generally protective against mood dysregulation. Intradaily variability and amplitude are slightly lower than average (IV Z = −0.53; amplitude Z = −0.47). The combination of a somewhat blunted amplitude with preserved day‑to‑day timing can reflect dampened physiological rhythm amplitude, which in some literature aligns with depressive symptomatology, but here the circadian regularity (high 24‑h autocorrelation) mitigates that interpretation.

Signals that point toward lower depressive symptoms or preserved functioning
There are several protective or neutral signals. The participant endorses a moderate current happiness rating (4.0; Z = +0.55) and reports strong academic functioning (GPA consistently ≈3.7–3.8), both of which suggest preserved positive affect and role functioning that tend to associate with lower CES‑D scores. Substance use is minimal or absent (alcohol, recreational and non‑prescribed drugs all “not at all”), which reduces risk for substance‑related mood exacerbation. Objective circadian regularity (autocorrelation at 24 h) and modestly low intradaily fragmentation may reflect preserved routine and daily structure, which are factors that can protect against higher depressive symptom severity.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Weighing the evidence, several high‑weight indicators (notably high trait anxiety with r = 0.81 and low self‑esteem with r = −0.71) together with disturbed subjective sleep, short and irregular objective sleep, elevated resting heart rate/mesor, minimal socializing, and high sedentary time point toward a level of depressive symptoms that is likely above the study population mean. Protective factors—moderate current happiness, strong academic performance, minimal substance use, and reasonably consistent day‑to‑day circadian timing—temper but do not outweigh the cumulative risk signals. Accordingly, the balance of multimodal data supports an inference that this participant’s depressive symptom level is above the population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.27), although this conclusion is probabilistic rather than diagnostic.

Caveats and recommended next steps
This evaluation integrates correlational sample‑level relationships and individual z‑scores: it is not a clinical diagnosis. The strongest single predictors in this dataset are trait anxiety and self‑esteem, so targeted follow‑up (e.g., formal CES‑D administration if not already collected, clinical interview focusing on affective symptoms, and a focused sleep assessment) would clarify current symptom severity and functional impact. If elevated depressive symptoms are confirmed, assessment of sleep regularization, activity engagement (increase in social/exercise behaviors), and interventions addressing anxiety and self‑esteem would be logical areas for intervention."
82728,"Evidence consistent with relatively elevated depressive symptoms: the participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 7, classified as disturbed sleep) and has a fairly late and variable sleep schedule (median sleep start ~01:05 AM with sleep-start SD ≈ 93 minutes). Subjective indicators of well‑being are mixed: current self‑reported happiness is lower than average (Happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53; Happy correlates -0.46 with CES‑D), and health satisfaction is below average (Z = -0.45; correlation with CES‑D = -0.39). Perceived stress is slightly above the study mean (PSS = 22, Z = 0.10; correlation with CES‑D = 0.28). A few wearable-derived features also point to modestly elevated physiological arousal associated with depressive symptoms: resting heart rate and mesor are slightly above the sample mean (RHR = 60.2, Z = 0.24; mesor = 76.53, Z = 0.35) and both show small positive correlations with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19). Taken together, these markers (disturbed sleep, lower subjective happiness/health satisfaction, mild stress, modestly elevated cardiac indices) form the primary evidence in the dataset that would be expected to associate with higher CES‑D scores.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms: several robust protective signals appear in both self‑report and wearable domains. Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23) and the STAI score has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.81), so a near‑average/low trait anxiety score substantially reduces the likelihood of a high CES‑D. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 37, Z = -0.17) and self‑esteem correlates strongly and negatively with CES‑D (r = -0.71), another substantial protective factor. Behavioral lifestyle measures are also generally favorable: frequent exercise (exercising alone three times/week or more; Z = 1.07), minimal substance use, consistent high academic performance (multiple 4.0 GPAs), and no daytime napping (Z = -0.86) are all behaviors typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Wearable circadian metrics indicate a relatively robust and regular heart‑rate rhythm (amplitude Z = 1.54, autocorrelation at 24h Z = 1.06, interdaily stability Z = 0.75 and intradaily variability Z = -0.53), which literature and the dataset’s small negative correlations with depressive indices suggest are protective against depressive symptoms.

Integrative weighing of the evidence: when weighting the relative strength of signals, two features with the strongest links to CES‑D in this sample (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) are both in directions that predict lower depressive symptoms for this participant (low‑to‑average STAI; high self‑esteem). The circadian/actigraphy-derived regularity and high amplitude provide additional objective support for relatively low symptom burden. Conversely, the principal risk indicators (sleep disturbance, late/variable sleep timing, lower current happiness, slightly elevated stress and modestly higher resting cardiac indices) are present but are smaller in magnitude or have weaker correlations with CES‑D in this dataset than the protective features. In short, the strongest and most predictive measures available (trait anxiety, self‑esteem, and circadian robustness) favor a lower CES‑D score, while several secondary measures temper that conclusion.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: taking the full set of evidence into account, the participant’s pattern of scores and wearables most consistently aligns with depressive symptom levels that are near or somewhat below the study sample mean. Concretely, the data are more consistent with a CES‑D score below the sample mean of 13.31 (and plausibly near or below the sample median of 11.5) rather than substantially above it. This interpretation is probabilistic and limited by the absence of a direct CES‑D value for this participant; it should be considered an inference combining multiple indicators rather than a diagnostic statement."
45076,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of risk and protective indicators for depressive symptoms. Several self-report measures (notably perceived stress, trait anxiety, reduced happiness, and lower health satisfaction) point toward elevated symptomatology, whereas consistently reported physical activity, relatively long objective sleep duration, and high self‑esteem point toward lower symptom levels. Considering the balance of these signals — especially the combination of high perceived stress and trait anxiety alongside protective behavioral factors — the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.3). The elevation appears moderate rather than extreme when weighing both self-report and wearable-derived metrics.

Features consistent with higher depressive symptoms: 
- Elevated perceived stress (PSS = 29, Z = 2.01) is a strong signal linked to higher CES‑D in the sample (correlation with CES‑D = +0.28). The participant’s stress score is well above the sample mean and thus is a salient risk factor. 
- Trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) is positively associated with CES‑D in this dataset (correlation = +0.81). Even though the STAI z‑score is only modestly above average, the strong STAI–CES‑D association in the sample increases the weight of this observation. 
- Lower momentary happiness (self-report = 3.0, Z = -0.53; correlation with CES‑D = -0.46) and lower health satisfaction (score = 3.0, Z = -0.95; corr = -0.39) are both consistent with higher depressive symptom levels in the study population. 
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6; classified as disturbed sleep) further supports risk for elevated CES‑D scores even though objective sleep duration is adequate (see below). 
- Some wearable-derived circadian indicators suggest reduced rhythmic robustness: interdaily stability is below average (0.32, Z = -0.74) and amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm is lower than the sample mean (amplitude = 9.42, Z = -0.44). Blunted circadian amplitude and reduced day‑to‑day stability are commonly associated with worse mood and are therefore additional, moderate risk signals.

Features consistent with lower depressive symptoms:
- Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg self‑esteem Z = +1.38) and, in this dataset, self‑esteem correlates negatively with CES‑D (corr = -0.71). This is a strong protective factor and argues against very high depressive symptom severity. 
- Regular and frequent physical activity (exercising alone and with others, and sports: all reported “three times a week or more”; Z-scores all > +1) are associated in the sample with lower CES‑D (negative correlations), providing behavioral resilience. 
- Objective sleep duration is favorable: median nightly sleep = 7 hr 38 min (Z = +0.56), with modest sleep timing variability. Adequate sleep duration as measured by wearables is typically protective and in this case reduces support for very elevated depressive symptoms. 
- Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.8 bpm, Z = -0.04) and the 24‑hour autocorrelation of heart rate is relatively high (0.42, Z = +0.81), suggesting preserved day‑to‑day regularity in overall activity/arousal that can be protective against severe affective dysregulation.

Physiological and temporal patterning: 
- The cosinor-derived MESOR (70.34 bpm, Z = -0.49) and a low amplitude (Z = -0.44) imply a modestly blunted daily heart‑rate rhythm even though the acrophase is at ~4:14 PM and the autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (Z = +0.81). In practice, this combination indicates that the participant shows a generally regular daily rhythm (good 24‑hour repeatability) but somewhat reduced day–night contrast in heart rate. Reduced amplitude with preserved 24‑hour autocorrelation can reflect lower physiological reactivity or attenuated daytime activation, patterns that have been associated with depressive symptoms in many studies. 
- Hourly aggregate deviations show normal nocturnal reductions (large negative deviations during the 2–6 AM window) and pronounced positive deviations in the mid‑ to late‑afternoon (largest at 4–5 PM, Z = +2.40). These afternoon elevations likely reflect typical daytime activity rather than pathological arousal; importantly, correlations between these hourly deviations and CES‑D are small in magnitude in this sample.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
- Balancing the inputs, the strongest single indicators toward elevated depressive symptoms are the very high perceived stress (PSS Z = +2.01) and the clustering of affective signals (lower self‑reported happiness and modestly elevated trait anxiety) — variables that, in this dataset, have meaningful associations with CES‑D. Protective factors of substantial magnitude are high self‑esteem (Z = +1.38), consistent exercise habits (Z > +1), and objectively adequate sleep duration (median 7 h 38 m, Z = +0.56). 
- Integrating these signals, the participant’s profile is best characterized as having a moderate elevation in depressive symptoms relative to the study population mean: above the population mean CES‑D (13.3), but not necessarily in the top quartile of severity. The presence of strong protective factors makes extreme elevation less likely, while the high perceived stress and affective indicators make a score near or above the sample mean more likely than a score well below it.

Clinical and measurement caveats:
- Conclusions are probabilistic and based on correlational patterns in the sample; wearable-derived metrics and single-time self-reports cannot establish diagnosis. Some scale values (e.g., absolute self‑esteem score reported) appear inconsistent with original instrument ranges and were interpreted using the provided z‑scores and correlations. Where correlations with CES‑D are small, those metrics were given correspondingly less weight."
44872,"Summary and overall impression
Across self-report and wearable domains the participant shows a mix of protective and risk indicators for depressive symptoms. Several strong self-report signals—particularly high self-esteem (RSES score elevated relative to the sample; Z = 0.68, CES-D correlation = -0.71) and high current happiness (Z = 1.64, CES-D correlation = -0.46)—point toward fewer depressive symptoms than the study average. Frequent exercise (both alone and with others; Zs ≈ 1.1–1.2), high health satisfaction (Z = 1.30, CES-D correlation = -0.39), substantial social time with friends (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95) and consistently strong academic performance (GPAs ≈ 3.8–3.9) are additional behavioral markers typically associated with lower depressive symptom levels. Taken together these protective features suggest that the participant’s CES-D is more likely to be at or below the study mean than markedly elevated.

Factors indicating relatively higher depressive symptom risk
There are several indicators that plausibly raise risk or are associated with higher CES-D in the sample. Subjective sleep quality is borderline disturbed (PSQI = 6; PSQI > 5 commonly signals clinically meaningful sleep difficulties) and the participant shows substantial variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start time SD Z = 1.55; sleep-duration SD Z = 0.77). Both sleep variability metrics have positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset (sleep start-time SD r ≈ 0.23; sleep-duration SD r ≈ 0.20), meaning greater irregularity here is associated with higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is moderately elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38; CES-D correlation = 0.28), which is another risk factor. Alcohol use is frequent (beer and wine/liquor three times per week or more; Zs ≈ 1.7); although the sample-level correlations with CES-D are near zero, frequent alcohol use can interact with sleep and stress to worsen mood over time. Finally, certain actigraphy/circadian indicators reflect irregularity (interdaily stability Z = -0.99; autocorrelation at 24 hours Z = -1.37), and while the direct correlations of those specific wearable rhythm metrics with CES-D are small in this sample, circadian irregularity is a plausible contributor to mood symptoms when present alongside disturbed sleep.

Physiological and circadian pattern interpretation
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a low mesor (61.8; Z = -1.65) and a low resting heart rate (48.3 bpm; Z = -1.17), which together are consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness; in this dataset lower RHR/mesor is weakly associated with lower CES-D (RHR correlation ≈ 0.19, mesor correlation ≈ 0.19). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show pronounced daytime elevations (very large positive deviations and Zs between ≈2.9–3.2 around late morning/noon and 5–6pm) and marked nocturnal declines (large negative deviations overnight). These large daytime peaks and clear overnight troughs indicate preserved day–night separation of cardiovascular arousal and are consistent with active daytime behavior and consolidated nighttime rest. At the same time, intradaily variability (fragmentation) is modestly elevated (IV Z = 0.46), suggesting some within-day irregularity in activity or arousal; in the present sample this metric is not strongly tied to CES-D (small negative correlation). Overall, the wearable physiology profile (low resting HR and strong daytime peaks) aligns more with an active, physically fit pattern that is generally protective against depressive symptoms, whereas circadian regularity metrics (low interdaily stability, elevated sleep-timing variability) raise modest concerns.

Balanced synthesis and conclusion relative to the study mean
Balancing the evidence, the strongest signals favoring lower depressive symptoms are: high self-esteem (strong inverse association with CES-D in this sample), elevated reported happiness, frequent exercise, high health satisfaction, active daytime physiology, and good academic functioning. Countervailing signals—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), elevated variability in sleep timing and duration, modestly elevated perceived stress, and frequent alcohol consumption—are present but generally weaker in their sample-level associations with CES-D or smaller in magnitude than the protective indicators. Given the pattern and the relative strengths of the associations (notably the strong negative correlation of self-esteem with CES-D and the participant’s high self-esteem), the overall evidence points to depressive symptom levels below the study population mean. In other words, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a CES-D level below the sample mean of 13.33, rather than substantially above it, although the sleep variability and perceived stress warrant attention as potential targets for preventive intervention or monitoring."
27306,"Summary of self-report and behavioral indicators
The participant’s self-report profile contains several features commonly associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is relatively high compared with the study sample (Z = +1.66) and is strongly negatively associated with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ −0.71), which argues for a protective effect. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, Z = −1.26), and health satisfaction is high (6.67 on a 1–7 scale, Z = +1.8); both are negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample and therefore point away from elevated depressive symptoms. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times per week or more, Z > +1.0) and minimal substance use, both of which are generally protective and show small negative correlations with CES-D here. Perceived stress (PSS = 21) and trait anxiety (STAI = 37) are near or below the study mean (STAI Z ≈ −0.43; PSS Z ≈ −0.17), which again is not suggestive of high symptom levels. These self-report features collectively provide multiple, relatively strong signals consistent with CES-D scores below the study population mean.

Self-report and behavioral signals that could point toward higher depressive symptoms
There are a few self-report and behavioral items that temper the overall protective pattern. Current self-rated happiness is somewhat below average (score = 3.0, Z ≈ −0.53), which aligns with increased depressive symptoms in the literature and shows a modest negative correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ −0.46). The participant also reports limited time in many recreational activities (several “do not do” responses and very low internet/entertainment usage), which could reflect restricted leisure engagement; however, correlations between these leisure indices and CES-D in this dataset are small and mixed. Taken together, these elements provide limited evidence for elevated depressive symptoms but do not outweigh the stronger protective self-report indicators.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns
The wearable-derived circadian profile shows a structured daily rhythm with some notable features. Mesor and resting heart rate are both relatively low (Mesor = 63.03, Z ≈ −1.49; Resting HR = 46.2, Z ≈ −1.42). Low resting HR and low mesor often reflect high aerobic fitness or low baseline cardiovascular arousal; in this dataset mesor and resting HR have small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ +0.19), so the participant’s low values trend in the direction associated with lower CES-D. Amplitude is modestly above average (Z ≈ +0.46) and the heart-rate acrophase is mid-day (≈1:53 PM), indicating a discernible daytime peak.

At the same time there are markers of intra-day irregularity. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (IV = 0.59, Z ≈ +0.32), and interdaily stability is slightly below average (IS = 0.38, Z ≈ −0.24), suggesting modest circadian fragmentation or less rigid day-to-day timing. Literature and prior work often link greater circadian fragmentation and reduced stability to higher depressive symptoms; in this sample the correlations between IV/IS and CES-D are very small (near zero), so their predictive value here is limited but worth noting as a mild risk signal.

Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced daytime peaks and nighttime troughs. Very large positive deviations in heart rate are observed in the morning (7–9 AM) and late afternoon (notably 4–5 PM, an extreme positive deviation, Z ≈ +7.8), while late evening and night hours show marked reductions relative to the mesor. These sharp within-day swings (high daytime peaks, deep evening/night troughs) indicate substantial diurnal variation; abrupt or extreme swings can, in other contexts, be associated with mood dysregulation, but the correlations between specific hourly deviations and CES-D in this sample are generally weak and inconsistent.

Integration and balanced interpretation
Putting the modalities together yields a predominately protective picture with some modest countervailing signals. Strong protective evidence: high self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, high health satisfaction, regular exercise, low substance use, and relatively low trait anxiety and perceived stress all point toward a lower probability of elevated depressive symptoms. Wearable physiology largely reinforces that interpretation: low resting heart rate and low mesor (consistent with lower cardiovascular arousal) and a clear day-time heart rate peak are not typical markers of high depressive symptomatology in this sample.

Potential risk or ambiguous signals: slightly lower self-rated happiness, modest circadian fragmentation (slightly elevated intradaily variability and slightly reduced interdaily stability), limited engagement in many leisure activities, and pronounced within-day heart-rate swings are features that could be associated with mood vulnerability in some contexts. However, in this dataset the statistical associations between most wearable circadian features and CES-D are small, so these signals should be considered tentative and subordinate to the stronger self-report protective indicators.

Conclusion about depressive symptom level relative to the study sample
Considering the full set of evidence — particularly the strong negative association of self-esteem with CES-D and the participant’s relatively high self-esteem, good subjective sleep, exercise habits, and low trait anxiety — the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.33). This conclusion is tempered by minor signals of circadian irregularity and somewhat lower current happiness, but the available multimodal data converge more strongly on a level of depressive symptoms below the population mean than on an elevated level.

Caveats
These inferences rely on correlations within the study sample and aggregate wearable summaries rather than clinical assessment. Several associations in the dataset are small, and some self-report scales contain atypical scoring or context-specific distributions; therefore the interpretation should be treated as probabilistic rather than definitive. If clinical concern remains, targeted clinical assessment or longitudinal monitoring would clarify symptom trajectory and risk."
46365,"Summary: The participant’s record combines generally good objective sleep duration and academic functioning with notable indicators of emotional arousal and evening/nighttime physiological activation. Two psychometric markers with strong associations to CES-D in this sample—trait anxiety (STAI) and self-esteem—pull in opposite directions: trait anxiety is elevated and, given its strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r ≈ 0.81), suggests increased depressive symptom risk; by contrast, a maximal self-esteem score (RSES = 40) is a potent protective indicator (study correlation r ≈ −0.71). Wearable-derived circadian features show partial irregularity of daily structure (lower interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation) alongside relatively low intraday fragmentation; heart rate shows elevated deviations late at night (around 11:00 PM–1:00 AM) and large nocturnal-to-morning declines. Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5) and median sleep duration is within an adequate range (≈7 h 16 m).

Factors in the data that are most consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms: elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 45; z ≈ 0.37) is the single strongest psychometric risk marker given its high sample correlation with CES-D. The participant reports lower current happiness (self-report lower than average; z ≈ −0.53), and lower satisfaction with physical health (z ≈ −1.45), both of which correlate modestly with higher CES-D in the sample. Behavioral indicators that can align with increased symptoms include high evening/night physiological arousal (aggregated hourly heart rate deviations show above-average elevations around 11 PM–1 AM), a late median sleep-start time (~01:34), frequent beer use (three times/week; z ≈ 1.72) and substantial internet use (>4 hours/day; z ≈ 2.19), which in this sample are associated weakly or inconsistently but in some cases in the direction of higher CES-D. Circadian summary metrics reflecting reduced day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation both below the sample mean) could also reflect behavioral irregularity that, in some literature and in this sample, is linked to greater symptom burden.

Factors in the data that are most consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms: maximal self-esteem is a strong protective signal in this dataset and is among the strongest single predictors of lower CES-D. Objective sleep duration is near the sample average (median ≈7 h 16 m; z ≈ 0.11) and subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; z ≈ −0.8) is in the “good” range, both of which argue against marked sleep-related depressive symptomatology. Academic functioning is high and stable (consistent 4.0 GPAs), which typically indexes preserved role functioning and lower symptom interference. Low intradaily variability (z ≈ −1.31) suggests the participant’s within-day activity pattern is not highly fragmented; in many analyses lower IV relates to fewer affective symptoms. The participant reports substantial social time (socializing >4 hours/day; z ≈ 2.53), which, although its correlation with CES-D in this sample is small, is commonly a protective behavioral resource.

Holistic comparison to the study population mean CES-D: weighing the strongest predictors (notably the high self-esteem that strongly predicts lower CES-D versus elevated trait anxiety that strongly predicts higher CES-D) together with relatively normal sleep duration, good subjective sleep quality, strong academic performance, and mixed but modest wearable circadian irregularities, the overall pattern most closely aligns with a depressive symptom level near or slightly below the study sample mean (population mean CES-D = 13.31). In other words, the balance of evidence does not strongly indicate markedly elevated depressive symptoms relative to the sampled population; if anything, protective factors (particularly very high self-esteem and preserved sleep duration/functioning) suggest the participant’s CES-D is likely near or a bit lower than the sample mean rather than substantially above it.

Caveats and uncertainty: several wearable markers (nocturnal heart-rate elevations, late sleep onset, alcohol and high internet use) point toward risk but have small correlations with CES-D in this sample, so their contribution to an overall symptom estimate is modest and uncertain. Conversely, the large predictive weight of self-esteem and trait anxiety in this dataset means divergence between these two measures contributes substantial uncertainty to the inferred CES-D level. These data are correlational and aggregated; they do not provide a clinical diagnosis and should be interpreted alongside direct CES-D scores and clinical assessment when available."
23287,"Summary and overall comparison:
Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s pattern of symptoms and behavior is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean (population CES-D mean = 13.33). Multiple robust protective indicators (e.g., low trait anxiety, good subjective sleep quality, high health satisfaction, frequent social exercise, low resting heart rate and low mesor on wearable data) point toward relatively lower CES-D-related symptom burden. A smaller set of features (greater daytime internet use, more frequent naps, and somewhat reduced self-reported current happiness and limited in-person social time) provide countervailing signals that could relate to elevated depressive symptoms for some individuals. Taken together, and weighted by magnitude of z-scores and known correlations with CES-D in the sample, the net profile is most consistent with “below the population mean” for depressive symptoms, although not uniformly low across every indicator.

Factors supporting relatively lower depressive symptomatology:
Several high-weight indicators converge on lower symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43) is below the study mean and, given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), this is a substantial protective sign. Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 38, Z ≈ -0.03) and strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), which again supports lower depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is notably good (PSQI = 3, Z = -1.72), and health satisfaction is well above the mean (6.56 on a 1–7 scale, Z = +1.71); both variables have moderate negative correlations with CES-D in the sample and therefore argue for fewer depressive symptoms. Behavioral supports include frequent group exercise (exercising with others three+ times/week, Z = +1.23) and minimal substance use; both patterns are associated with lower CES-D scores in the cohort. Objective circadian and cardiovascular metrics also align with more favorable functioning: resting heart rate (40.6 bpm, Z = -2.09) and MESOR of hourly heart rate (57.82, Z = -2.20) are substantially lower than the sample mean; because higher mesor/resting HR shows a positive correlation with CES-D in the study, these low values tend to index lower depressive symptom levels. Sleep duration is relatively long (median 8h23m, Z = +1.49) and sleep timing variability is not elevated; together with the good PSQI, this supports adequate sleep-related functioning rather than the fragmentation or insomnia patterns often seen with higher CES-D.

Factors suggesting relatively higher depressive symptomatology or risk:
A smaller set of measures points in the opposite direction. The participant reports less current subjective happiness than the sample mean (Happy Z = -0.53), and self-reported happiness has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.46), so lower happiness is a relevant countervailing signal. Daily internet use is elevated (3–4 hours, Z = +1.52) and shows a positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.26), which may reflect sedentary or ruminative patterns associated with higher depressive symptoms in the cohort. Mean daily naps are relatively frequent (0.25 naps/day, Z = +2.07) and correlate positively with CES-D (r ≈ 0.22), suggesting that daytime sleepiness or compensatory sleep could be linked to higher symptom reports for some participants. Social contact reported as 16–30 minutes of socializing (Z = -1.41) is low relative to peers; although its direct correlation with CES-D in this sample is small, limited social interaction can be a risk factor in other contexts. In sum, these features do not outweigh the stronger protective signals but should be noted as potential areas of vulnerability.

Physiological and circadian rhythm interpretation:
Objective heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a well-structured rhythm overall. Interdaily stability (0.45, Z ≈ +0.33) and intradaily variability (0.57, Z ≈ +0.17) are close to the sample mean, and amplitude is slightly above average (Z ≈ +0.56), which together suggest a relatively regular, robust daily rhythm rather than the blunted or highly irregular patterns sometimes associated with higher depressive symptoms. Hourly deviations from the MESOR show large nocturnal decreases (deep negative deviations overnight) and pronounced positive deviations in the late evening (particularly 9–11pm; Z ≈ +2.09 and +2.37), implying relatively elevated cardiac activity in the late evening compared with the sample average. Because subjective sleep quality is good and median sleep onset is near 01:00, this pattern could reflect late-evening activity followed by sustained sleep rather than fragmented sleep, but the elevated evening arousal and higher nap frequency warrant attention as possible contributors to daytime tiredness or dysregulated sleep–wake behavior. Overall, the pronounced low resting HR and low MESOR are physiologically notable (large negative z-scores) and, given their modest positive correlations with CES-D in the sample, they contribute evidence toward lower depressive symptoms.

Holistic conclusion and limitations:
Balancing all modalities, the participant’s profile contains multiple strong protective signals (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, high health satisfaction, frequent group exercise, and low resting heart rate/mesor), and a smaller set of modest risk indicators (increased internet use, more frequent naps, somewhat reduced current happiness, limited social time). On balance these data are most consistent with depressive symptomatology below the study population mean. This is an inference based on associational signals and population-level correlations; it is not a clinical diagnosis. Where possible, follow-up or repeated measures (including a direct CES-D score if available, or clinical interview) would provide confirmatory information, and the noted risk features (evening arousal, napping, limited in-person social contact) could be monitored or addressed if concern about mood arises."
28247,"Risk indicators consistent with elevated depressive symptoms are prominent in this multimodal profile. The participant’s trait anxiety is markedly elevated (STAI = 61, Z = 1.95), and that scale shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D within the sample (r = 0.81); this is one of the single strongest statistical signals in the dataset for higher depressive symptomatology. Low global self-esteem (RSES = 31, Z = −1.01) is also a robust correlate of higher CES-D in the study (r = −0.71) and therefore constitutes another substantive risk factor. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep) together with objectively short median nightly sleep duration (6 h 26 min, Z = −0.94) and especially very irregular sleep timing (median sleep start 01:03; sleep start time SD = 208 minutes, Z = 2.74) further point toward sleep-related vulnerability. Behavioral markers associated with greater depressive symptoms include low frequency of exercise (particularly exercising with others = “not at all,” Z = −1.58) and relatively high time spent listening to music (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.06), the latter of which shows a modest positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.25). Modest perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38; r ≈ 0.28) and low interpersonal trust and health satisfaction (both below population mean Z ≈ −1.0) add to a constellation of psychosocial risk.

Several features in the data are more consistent with lower depressive symptom levels or with preserved functioning. The participant reports relatively high ongoing social time (socializing with friends > 4 hours, Z = 2.53), and social contact in this sample does not show a strong positive association with CES-D (r ≈ −0.02), suggesting a potentially protective social engagement. Academic performance appears high (GPAs in the mid–high 3.5–3.9 range), which indicates preserved cognitive/academic functioning. Current self-rated happiness (score = 4.0, Z ≈ 0.55) trends in the direction opposite of depression (sample correlation r ≈ −0.46), and substance use is minimal. Resting heart rate and overall mean mesor are near the sample mean (RHR = 62.2, mesor ≈ 75 bpm, small positive Zs), not indicating physiological hyperarousal at rest; body mass index is within a normative range (20.9). These factors temper the risk profile and point to areas of relatively preserved functioning.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate patterns provide additional, mixed information. Nonparametric rhythm metrics show reduced interdaily stability (value = 0.23, Z = −1.48) and elevated intradaily variability (value = 0.76, Z = 1.51), indicating an irregular, fragmented daily pattern of activity/physiological arousal across days; reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude = 5.8, Z = −1.61) further signals diminished day–night contrast. These circadian features are often observed alongside mood disturbance and sleep irregularity and are therefore concordant with the other risk indicators in this profile. The cosinor acrophase is in the late afternoon (≈ 4:08 PM) and the hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal declines and daytime increases; none of the hourly deviations carry large sample correlations with CES-D in this dataset, so they are less informative for depressive-symptom inference than the sleep timing variability and the parametric/nonparametric circadian indices.

Overall synthesis and comparison to the study population mean: weighting the strongest statistical signals (very high trait anxiety with strong positive correlation to CES-D; low self-esteem with strong negative correlation to CES-D; marked sleep timing irregularity; low social exercise and reduced circadian amplitude/regularity), the profile is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean CES-D score (population mean CES-D = 13.27). This judgment emphasizes the high-anxiety and low-self-esteem indicators—each strongly associated with CES-D in the sample—and is supported by objective sleep irregularity and circadian fragmentation. At the same time, preserved academic functioning, substantial social time, minimal substance use, and a moderate present happiness score are mitigating features that argue against extreme functional impairment. In sum, the multimodal evidence points toward depressive symptomatology that is likely above the population mean but accompanied by several protective factors; uncertainty remains because no direct participant CES-D total score is provided and because some wearable–CES-D correlations in this dataset are small."
72806,"Summary of self-report indicators: On trait and symptom questionnaires the participant shows several markers that are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 33, z = -0.82) is below the study mean and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81); by this indicator the participant is less likely to have elevated CES‑D scores. Global self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39, z = 0.11), and self‑esteem correlates negatively with CES‑D in the sample (r = -0.71), again suggesting lower depressive symptom risk. Subjective sleep quality on the PSQI is 5 (z = -0.8) — classified as “good sleep” relative to the sample — which, given the negative relationship between poor sleep and depression, is another protective sign. The participant reports moderate perceived stress (PSS = 21, z = -0.17) and above‑average interpersonal trust (z = 0.83), the latter of which correlates negatively with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.41). Together these self‑report data most strongly point toward a profile that would tend away from high CES‑D scores.

Self‑reported indicators that point toward relatively higher depressive symptoms are more limited but present. Current self‑reported happiness is somewhat low (3.0, z = -0.53), and happiness correlates negatively with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.46), so this lower happiness rating is a signal consistent with greater depressive symptoms. Other behavioral self‑reports — modest socializing, limited participation in sports, little time spent on music or video games — illustrate relatively low engagement in some recreational activities; although correlations between these specific habits and CES‑D are small in the sample, decreased behavioral activation/social/recreational engagement is conceptually consistent with depressive symptomatology and thus should be noted as a possible risk‑relevant pattern.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart‑rate–based circadian metrics largely reflect a reasonably regular and robust rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.47, z = 0.5) and autocorrelation at 24 h are slightly above average, amplitude is modestly elevated (amplitude = 12.52, z = 0.56), and MESOR and resting heart rate are slightly below the sample mean (MESOR = 72 bpm, z = -0.27; resting HR = 56.4 bpm, z = -0.21). These features (regular day‑to‑day structure, clear amplitude, lower resting HR) are generally not characteristic of pronounced circadian disruption that often accompanies higher CES‑D scores; correlations between these wearable circadian measures and CES‑D are small in the sample. The aggregated hourly deviation profile shows a pronounced evening elevation in heart rate (peak ~6–7 pm, +25 bpm deviation, z = 2.22) and expected nocturnal decreases; the evening peak may reflect a time of routine activity, exercise, or social scheduling rather than a psychopathological signature, and its relationship to CES‑D is not strong in the sample-level correlations provided.

Sleep and napping behavior: Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate generally healthy sleep quantity and stability. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 34 min (z = 0.47) with modest night‑to‑night variability (SD = 85 minutes, z = -0.36). Median sleep start time is around 00:30 and its variability is not elevated (SD z ≈ -0.32). These objective metrics align with the subjective PSQI classification of relatively good sleep. One small caution is a slightly higher-than-average mean daily nap frequency (0.13 naps/day, z = 0.7), which has a small positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.21); increased napping can sometimes co‑occur with low mood or fatigue, but the magnitude here is modest.

Balancing evidence for higher versus lower depressive symptoms and overall inference: On balance the strongest and most consistent signals point toward lower depressive symptom burden: low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, good subjective and objective sleep, regular circadian structure, modest resting heart rate, and relatively low substance use. The main indicators suggestive of elevated symptoms are lower current happiness, small reductions in some recreational/social engagement, and slightly increased napping; these signals are weaker in magnitude and in the sample they have smaller correlations with CES‑D than the protective markers listed above. Given the pattern and the provided sample correlations, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels near or somewhat below the study population mean rather than substantially above it.

Explicit comparison to the study population mean CES‑D: Using the available multimodal evidence (strong protective trait scores, generally healthy sleep and circadian markers, and only modest risk signals), the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level would be characterized as near the population mean — tending slightly below the study mean CES‑D score of 13.33 (SD = 9.61), rather than clearly above it. This inference is probabilistic and indirect (no direct CES‑D score was provided); it should be interpreted in light of the stronger predictive indicators (e.g., STAI and self‑esteem) and the relatively small sample correlations linking many wearable features to CES‑D."
39146,"Summary of features that align with relatively higher depressive symptom burden:
The participant’s profile includes several measures associated with elevated CES-D scores. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42; Z ≈ 0.07) is notable because the STAI–Trait score shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81); even a modestly elevated anxiety score is therefore an important risk indicator. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 25; Z = 0.92), and increased stress in this sample correlates positively with depressive symptoms (r ≈ 0.28). Subjective happiness is below the study mean (Happy = 3.0; Z = –0.53), and lower self-reported happiness is moderately associated with higher CES-D (r ≈ –0.46). On the physiological side, resting heart rate and heart-rate mesor are above the sample mean (RHR = 65.4 bpm, Z = 0.86; MESOR = 78.4, Z = 0.61) and have modest positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting mildly elevated cardiovascular arousal that, in this sample, is linked to greater depressive symptoms. Behavioral markers that can increase risk include very low levels of exercise (exercising alone and with others both well below the sample mean) and relatively high time spent on sedentary hobbies and video games (video games Z ≈ 2.47; sedentary hobby Z ≈ 1.41), both patterns that are weakly or inconsistently associated with higher CES-D in the study but nonetheless represent behavioral contexts frequently seen with elevated symptoms. Finally, the participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 1:32 AM) and median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (≈6 h 48 min, Z ≈ –0.47); late bedtimes and shorter total sleep are commonly linked with depressive symptoms even when subjective sleep quality is reported as adequate.

Summary of features that align with relatively lower depressive symptom burden:
There are multiple protective features that argue against a high CES-D score. Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES equivalent, Z ≈ 0.68) and the RSES score shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ –0.71), making higher self-esteem a substantial protective factor in this dataset. Subjective sleep quality is relatively good (PSQI = 5; Z ≈ –0.8), and better self-reported sleep is generally associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Substance use is minimal (no reported beer, wine/liquor, or non-prescribed drugs), which is protective given associations between substance use and depressive symptoms in many samples. Social engagement is roughly average (socializing with friends ~1–2 hours, Z ≈ 0.16), and health satisfaction is above average (Z ≈ 0.38), both of which tend to correlate with lower CES-D. Circadian and wearable-derived rhythm metrics are not strongly disrupted: interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.42), autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (Z ≈ 1.15), and intradaily variability is only modestly elevated (Z ≈ 0.53). These rhythm features indicate reasonably consistent day-to-day structure in heart-rate patterns, which in this dataset are not strongly associated with higher CES-D and can be considered a stabilizing factor.

Integrated interpretation and relative standing compared to the study population:
Weighing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile. The strongest single statistical indicator pointing toward higher depressive symptoms in this sample is trait anxiety (high correlation with CES-D), and perceived stress and slightly elevated resting cardiovascular tone provide additional risk signal. Against this, relatively high self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, low substance use, and reasonable circadian regularity are meaningful protective factors—self-esteem in particular has a large inverse association with CES-D in the sample. Considering the magnitude and direction of both risk and protective indicators, the most defensible summary is that the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely near to slightly above the study population mean CES-D score of 13.31. In other words, the profile does not strongly indicate extreme depressive symptomatology relative to the cohort (i.e., unlikely to be at or above the 75th percentile), but several concordant risk markers (notably anxiety and perceived stress, plus some behavioral patterns) make an above-mean CES-D level plausible.

Caveats and uncertainty:
This assessment is probabilistic and anchored to correlational relationships observed in the study sample; it does not establish causation or a clinical diagnosis. Wearable heart-rate metrics are aggregated by hour and across days and cannot resolve acute within-day events or individual-day fluctuations. The self-report instruments and several behavioral metrics provide mixed signals, so the final inference carries uncertainty—the strongest single predictors in the data (trait anxiety and self-esteem) pull in opposite directions but the anxiety correlation is larger. If greater precision is required (for research or clinical triage), collecting a contemporaneous CES-D score and/or follow-up measures of anxiety, stress, sleep timing, and activity would reduce uncertainty."
67918,"Summary:
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a pattern of well-regulated sleep and circadian physiology, relatively high self-regard and academic functioning, low substance use, and only modest self-reported negative affect. Several of these features (high self-esteem, good subjective sleep, regular circadian rhythms) are robustly associated with lower depressive symptomatology in this sample, while a few small signals in self-reported momentary affect and some physiological indices point weakly in the opposite direction. Taken holistically, the preponderance of evidence is most consistent with an overall level of depressive symptoms below the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.33).

Evidence indicating relatively lower depressive symptoms:
- Self-report: The participant’s Rosenberg Self-Esteem score is elevated (z = +1.38) and the STAI–Trait score is below average (35; z = −0.62). In this dataset self-esteem and trait anxiety show strong correlations with CES-D in opposite directions (self-esteem r ≈ −0.71; STAI r ≈ +0.81), so the combination of high self-esteem and low trait anxiety provides relatively strong protective evidence against elevated depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is also high (z ≈ +1.22), which in this sample correlates negatively with CES-D (r ≈ −0.39). 
- Sleep and circadian regularity: Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI score = 3; z = −1.72) and wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration is long compared with peers (median 8 h 42 min; z = +1.88) with low night-to-night variability (sleep-duration SD z ≈ −0.6). Objective circadian features from heart rate show high interdaily stability (0.59; z = +1.49), strong 24-hour autocorrelation (z = +1.65), and low intradaily variability (0.37; z = −1.24). These circadian metrics indicate a stable, consolidated daily rhythm—features that, in this sample, are associated with lower CES-D or are at least not characteristic of higher symptom burden. 
- Behavior and lifestyle: Minimal substance use and no reported naps (both z well below sample means), modest but not excessive sedentary recreational time, and high academic performance (GPA consistently ≈ 3.9) are additional behavioral indicators that, collectively, align with lower depressive symptom risk in this cohort.

Evidence indicating relatively higher depressive symptoms or residual concern:
- Momentary mood: Current self-reported happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (happy current = 3.0; z ≈ −0.53) and in the study happy scores correlate negatively with CES-D (r ≈ −0.46). This suggests some mild reduction in momentary positive affect relative to peers, which is relevant because low positive affect is a core component of depressive symptomatology.
- Physiological indices with small positive correlations to CES-D: Resting heart rate (62.8 bpm; z ≈ +0.55) and MESOR (mean circadian HR ≈ 81.3; z ≈ +1.0) show small positive correlations with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ +0.19–0.20). While these relationships are modest, the participant’s above-average baseline heart-rate metrics provide a slight physiological signal that aligns with higher CES-D at the group level. 
- Low exercise frequency: Self-reported frequency of exercise (1–2 times a month for both alone and with others) is below the sample mean (z negative); exercise frequency in this dataset has a small negative correlation with CES-D. This low activity level is a modest behavioral risk factor, though its effect size here appears small.

Circadian and hourly heart-rate profile (integrative interpretation):
Wearable-derived hourly deviations from mesor show the expected pronounced nocturnal heart-rate nadir (large negative deviations overnight) and a clear daytime peak in the early to mid-afternoon (largest positive deviations around 1–3 pm, with z-scores for those hours reaching +1.95 to +2.34). The elevated amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm (z ≈ +1.59) and pronounced daytime peaks reflect a strong day–night contrast; in this sample higher amplitude and greater circadian regularity generally associate with lower CES-D (amplitude correlation ≈ −0.10, interdaily stability correlation ≈ 0.00 to small). There are no marked nocturnal elevations or flattened patterns that would suggest circadian disruption commonly observed with higher depressive symptoms.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population:
Balancing all available evidence, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean CES-D score (13.33). Protective indicators—especially elevated self-esteem (strong inverse correlate), low trait anxiety, good subjective sleep, long and regular objective sleep, and robust circadian organization—carry the greatest weight. Countervailing signals (slightly lower momentary happiness, above-average resting HR and MESOR, low exercise frequency) are present but modest in magnitude and do not outweigh the larger, more consistent indicators of lower symptom burden. Therefore, the integrated multimodal evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the population mean, though small physiological and affective signals merit routine monitoring if clinical concern arises."
34467,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable domains the participant shows a mix of protective psychosocial assets and some physiological/behavioral markers that are modestly associated with depressive symptoms. Prominent protective indicators include high self-esteem (RSES score 40, z = 0.26), low trait anxiety (STAI = 33, z = -0.82), a high current happiness rating (5.0, z = 1.64), frequent social exercise (exercised with others three times a week or more, z = 1.23), excellent academic performance (GPAs ~4.0), low substance use, and above-average health satisfaction (z = 0.8). On balance these factors are typically associated with lower CES-D scores in the study sample. Against that, there are specific sleep- and circadian-related features (subjective sleep disturbance, variability in sleep timing, and reduced circadian regularity) that tend to relate to elevated depressive symptoms.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher depressive symptoms
The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 8, classified as “Disturbed Sleep,” z = 0.59), which is a known correlate of higher depressive symptomatology. Wearable-derived sleep metrics show notable irregularity: sleep start time standard deviation is large (134 minutes, z = 1.12) and sleep duration standard deviation is elevated (128 minutes, z = 0.61). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced stability and greater fragmentation — interdaily stability is low (0.30, z = -0.90) and intradaily variability is elevated (0.75, z = 1.44) — a pattern that in the literature and in the study sample is often associated with increased mood symptoms. Several wearable features that index timing/regularity have small positive correlations with CES-D in the dataset (e.g., sleep start time variability correlation ≈ 0.22), suggesting these irregular sleep/circadian characteristics are plausible contributors to higher depressive symptom scores for this participant.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower depressive symptoms
Multiple robust psychosocial and behavioral indicators point toward lower depressive symptom levels. The participant’s STAI trait anxiety is below the sample mean (z = -0.82) and self-esteem is at the ceiling of the RSES (score 40), both of which are strongly negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample (self-esteem correlation ≈ -0.71; STAI correlation ≈ +0.81 for anxiety but here low anxiety). Current self-reported happiness is substantially above average (z = 1.64, correlation with CES-D ≈ -0.46). The participant reports frequent socially embedded exercise (z = 1.23), minimal substance use, consistent high academic achievement, and above-average health satisfaction; these behaviors and resources are all associated with lower depressive symptoms in the study data. Many wearable-to-CES-D correlations are small or inconsistent, further reducing the weight of any single physiological marker.

Physiological pattern and interpretation
Cardiovascular metrics show a low mesor (58.35, z = -2.13) and a low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, z = -1.49). These values are substantially below the study mean and likely reflect high cardiovascular fitness or other non-pathological individual differences rather than depressive physiology; in this dataset both mesor and resting heart rate show only small positive correlations with CES-D (~0.19), so they are weak indicators of symptom severity. The hourly aggregated deviation profile shows expected low overnight values and pronounced morning increases (large positive deviations around 7–9 AM), with an acrophase at ~2:42 PM; there is no clear pattern of hyperarousal persisting into nighttime hours. Taken together, the physiological rhythm appears shifted but not suggestive of marked physiological arousal that would strongly indicate higher depressive symptoms independent of the sleep irregularity findings.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample
Weighing the evidence, the stronger and more consistent signals (high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, high current happiness, frequent social exercise, low substance use, high academic performance and health satisfaction) point toward a depressive symptom level that is below the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.32, SD = 9.62). Sleep and circadian irregularity represent notable risk factors that could elevate symptom levels relative to the participant’s otherwise protective profile, but the magnitude of those risks in this dataset is modest and counterbalanced by several robust protective factors. Therefore the most likely inference is that this participant’s CES-D score would be below the population mean (i.e., lower depressive symptom burden than average in the sample), while not ruling out the presence of some sleep-related distress that may warrant monitoring or behavioral intervention.

Caveats
This inference is probabilistic and based on correlational patterns across survey and wearable-derived features rather than a measured CES-D score for the individual in the provided data. Some wearable metrics (e.g., low resting heart rate, low mesor) can reflect fitness or measurement differences rather than mood-related physiology. The sleep/circadian irregularity merits attention because it is a modifiable domain that can affect mood over time even in individuals who are otherwise functioning well."
59673,"Summary and overall comparison to sample mean:
Considering the full set of survey and wearable indicators, the participant presents a mixed profile of risk and protective features for depressive symptoms. Several strong protective signals (notably elevated self-esteem and self-reported current happiness, and low trait anxiety) point toward fewer depressive symptoms than many peers, whereas sleep disturbance, irregular sleep timing, and some markers of circadian irregularity point toward elevated risk. Taking these signals together, the pattern is most consistent with an overall depressive symptom level near or modestly below the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.32). In other words, the data suggest the participant’s CES‑D-related symptom burden is likely not substantially above the sample mean and may be somewhat lower than average, though clear risk features warrant attention.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher CES‑D symptoms:
- Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep; Z ≈ 0.59), and greater PSQI scores are generally associated with higher CES‑D in the sample. Poor sleep quality is a well-established correlate of depressive symptoms and appears salient here.  
- Objective sleep regularity also suggests risk: sleep duration variability is elevated (sleep duration SD = 144 min, Z ≈ 0.98) and sleep start time is late and variable (median start ≈ 01:21, start-time SD ≈ 98 min). Both greater variability and later timing show small positive correlations with CES‑D in the dataset (sleep variability and nap frequency correlations ≈ +0.2), implying irregular sleep timing and increased napping (mean daily naps Z ≈ 1.27) are behaviors that tend to accompany higher symptom burden.  
- Several circadian/heart-rate features point weakly toward reduced circadian regularity: autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.24; Z ≈ −0.70), and some nonparametric metrics are only modestly regular. A low day-to-day consistency in physiological rhythm can be associated with mood symptoms.  
- Lower health satisfaction (score 2.67; Z ≈ −1.20) and a modest level of perceived stress (PSS = 22; Z ≈ 0.1) are also consistent with greater risk for depressive symptoms in the sample (health satisfaction correlates negatively with CES‑D).

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower CES‑D symptoms:
- Self‑esteem is substantially elevated relative to the study sample (Rosenberg-related metric Z ≈ +1.66) and has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in the dataset (r ≈ −0.71). High self‑esteem is one of the most robust protective markers present.  
- Current self-reported happiness is above average (Current Happy score = 4.0; Z ≈ +0.55) and correlates negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.46), providing further evidence of lower symptom burden.  
- Trait anxiety is relatively low (STAI = 37; Z ≈ −0.43, classified as “not anxious”), and lower anxiety proneness is associated with lower CES‑D in the sample (STAI–CES‑D correlation ≈ +0.81 for anxiety with depression, but this participant’s lower STAI score is protective).  
- Objective physiological indicators include a relatively low resting heart rate (57.2 bpm; Z ≈ −0.11) and a mean MESOR near the sample average (MESOR ≈ 74.7 bpm; Z ≈ +0.10). These cardio-physiological features do not show patterns that strongly align with higher depressive symptoms and may reflect generally preserved autonomic function.  
- Behavioral markers of functioning — for example high academic performance (GPAs in the high 3.7–3.92 range) and relatively modest substance use — further support preserved everyday functioning that tends to be associated with lower depressive symptomatology.

Integrated interpretation and practical implications:
Taken together, the strongest single protective indicator is elevated self‑esteem (large positive Z and strong negative correlation with CES‑D), supported by current happiness and low trait anxiety; these suggest the participant is likely to report fewer depressive symptoms than many peers. Conversely, the most salient risk domain is sleep: both subjective sleep complaints and objectively measured irregularity/late timing (and somewhat increased napping) are reliably associated with higher CES‑D in the study and stand out here. Circadian regularity metrics are not strongly deviant overall, but low 24‑hour autocorrelation and elevated nocturnal/evening heart-rate deviations (e.g., relatively high deviations around midnight and evening hours) are consistent with late-night physiological arousal that can accompany poor sleep and mood symptoms. Overall, the balance of evidence suggests depressive symptom level near or modestly below the sample mean (i.e., not clearly elevated), but with clear, addressable sleep- and health‑satisfaction–related risk factors that could increase symptom burden if unmodified.

If clinical or research monitoring is planned, prioritizing interventions or monitoring aimed at sleep timing regularity (reducing night-to-night variability, earlier and more consistent bedtimes, limiting naps) and addressing health satisfaction concerns would target the most actionable areas linked to higher CES‑D in this participant’s data. Continuous monitoring of sleep quality and daytime functioning could help determine whether the protective factors (high self‑esteem, low anxiety, subjective happiness) remain stable over time."
74899,"Summary of self-report risk indicators: The participant reports several self-reported characteristics that are strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms in this sample. Trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = 1.06) is high and the STAI in this study shows a large positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81), indicating that this anxious trait is one of the more powerful predictors of higher depressive scores. Perceived stress is also markedly elevated (PSS = 30, Z = 2.28), which aligns with greater symptom burden (r ≈ 0.28). Self-esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 32, Z = −0.87) and has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which is consistent with higher depressive symptomatology. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05), a pattern commonly linked to worse mood. Together, these self-report measures—high anxiety, high stress, low self‑esteem and disturbed subjective sleep—provide converging evidence that the participant is likely to have above‑average depressive symptomatology relative to the study sample.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors that reduce risk: Several behavioral indicators point toward resilience or lower depressive risk. The participant reports regular physical activity (exercising alone three+ times per week; Z ≈ 1.07) and minimal recreational/non‑prescription drug use, both of which tend to be associated with lower CES‑D scores (exercise correlations here are modestly negative). Trust of others and health satisfaction are both higher than average (Trust Z = 1.79; Health Satisfaction Z = 1.3) and these measures correlate negatively with CES‑D (Trust r ≈ −0.41; Health Satisfaction r ≈ −0.39), suggesting interpersonal and health‑related resources that might buffer mood symptoms. Alcohol use is moderate (beer 1–2×/week) rather than heavy, and social time is present (1–2 hours/day), which are not strong risk signals in this dataset. These protective features temper the risk conferred by the self‑report markers above but do not outweigh the stronger risk signals.

Wearable-derived physiology and sleep behavior: Objective sleep and circadian measures show patterns commonly linked to mood disturbance. Median nightly sleep is short (about 5 h 58 min; Z = −1.52) and sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 02:25 AM) with moderate night‑to‑night variability. Although the direct correlation of objective sleep duration with CES‑D in this dataset is small, short and late sleep timing, together with a poor PSQI, indicate both insufficient and misaligned sleep that often co‑occurs with elevated depressive symptoms. Heart‑rate based circadian metrics show a slightly elevated mesor (mean level; 80.9 bpm, Z = 0.95) and a modestly elevated amplitude (Z = 0.54), with acrophase in the early evening (≈ 5:49 PM). Resting heart rate is modestly above average (62.1 bpm, Z = 0.47) and correlates positively with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19). Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced evening heart‑rate elevation (peak +22 bpm at 5–6 PM, Z = 1.69) and deep nocturnal troughs (~ −20 bpm early morning), indicating a pronounced diurnal swing rather than a blunted flat profile; however, intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z = 0.46) and autocorrelation/regularity metrics are only modest, suggesting some fragmentation of rhythm. Overall, the wearable physiology supports a picture of increased autonomic arousal and circadian misalignment that is more consistent with higher depressive symptom levels in this sample.

Factors that argue against marked depressive symptom severity: Although there are several risk signals, some data argue against extremely high CES‑D relative to the sample. Protective psychosocial indicators (high interpersonal trust, good self‑rated health satisfaction), regular exercise, low drug use, and only moderate leisure inactivity suggest functioning resources that typically mitigate severe symptomatology. Objective circadian amplitude is not reduced (amplitude Z positive) and the participant displays regular evening activity peaks rather than a persistently flattened rhythm; these features are not characteristic of the most severe presentations in this dataset. Additionally, some wearable‑CES‑D correlations for specific metrics (e.g., interdaily stability, intradaily variability) are small or near zero, indicating limited predictive value for depressive score in isolation.

Overall inference relative to the study sample: Weighing the evidence across modalities—strong self‑report indicators with high predictive correlation (elevated trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, high perceived stress, poor subjective sleep), objective markers of short and late sleep, and modestly elevated resting and average heart rate—the pattern is most consistent with an inferred CES‑D level that is above the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.3). Protective factors (trust, health satisfaction, regular exercise, low substance use) reduce the likelihood of very high CES‑D scores but do not counterbalance the strong risk signals. In summary, the multimodal profile suggests depressive symptoms above the population mean, with specific targets for monitoring including anxiety, stress, subjective sleep disturbance, and late/short sleep timing."
35011,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of objective physiological dysregulation and subjective self-report signs that are generally protective. Prominent wearable-derived signals include pronounced circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z = -1.98), reduced rhythm amplitude (Z = -2.10), elevated intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = 1.37), and an unusually high resting heart rate (77.6 bpm, Z = 2.31). Subjective reports show disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 7), a late median sleep start time (02:34), and relatively short median nightly sleep (6 h 5 min, Z = -1.37). At the same time, trait and state self-reports—lower trait anxiety (STAI = 36, Z = -0.52), comparatively high self‑esteem (RSES z = 0.96), and above‑average momentary happiness (Z = 0.55)—point away from a high level of depressive symptoms.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES‑D symptoms: The wearable-derived circadian metrics point to blunted and unstable daily physiology, a pattern that has been linked in prior work to elevated depressive symptomatology. Interdaily stability is low (0.17, Z = -1.98) and amplitude is low (4.29, Z = -2.10), indicating weak day–night separation in heart‑rate rhythms; intradaily variability is relatively high (0.74, Z = 1.37), indicating fragmentation of activity/arousal across the day. The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are both substantially above the sample mean (RHR Z = 2.31; mesor Z = 1.74), which—given the positive correlation of RHR with CES‑D in this sample—also favors elevated symptom risk. Objectively short sleep duration, late sleep onset (median 02:34), and a PSQI in the “disturbed sleep” range further align with patterns commonly associated with increased depressive symptoms. Low health satisfaction (score = 1.89, Z = -1.78) is another self-report item that tends to co-occur with higher depressive scores in the study (correlation ≈ -0.39).

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES‑D symptoms: Several self-report measures strongly suggest lower depressive symptoms in this participant. Trait anxiety is below the sample mean (STAI = 36, Z = -0.52), and this scale shows a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the study (r ≈ 0.82), so the participant’s lower anxiety level is a robust protective indicator. Reported self‑esteem is higher than average (RSES z ≈ 0.96) and the RSES is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), which is another substantial protective factor. Current self‑reported happiness is above average (Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS score = 18, Z = -0.98); both of these tendencies point toward lower depressive symptom burden. The participant also reports minimal recreational drug use and low perceived stress, which are generally protective or neutral in this dataset.

Synthesis and overall comparison to the study mean: The profile is mixed—objective physiology and sleep timing/quality indicate elevated risk for depressive symptoms, while multiple self‑report trait/state measures indicate resilience. Because the strongest study-level predictors of CES‑D in these data are self‑reported anxiety and self‑esteem (with large correlation coefficients), and the participant scores favorably on those measures, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely near the population mean rather than substantially above it. In other words, the participant’s inferred CES‑D level most plausibly falls near the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.29) rather than clearly below or well above it; however, several physiological and sleep indicators indicate elevated risk that could push symptoms upward under stress or over time.

Interpretive caveats: The wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular markers raise concern about physiological dysregulation that is often seen with depressive syndromes, but correlations between these specific metrics and CES‑D in this sample are modest. Self-report measures that are highly predictive of CES‑D in this dataset (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) are comparatively favorable for this participant, and therefore carry substantial weight in the overall inference. These data are cross‑sectional/aggregated and do not establish directionality; convergent longitudinal monitoring or targeted clinical assessment would be needed to clarify whether the physiological irregularities presage increasing depressive symptoms despite current self‑reported resilience."
89710,"Summary of self-report indicators associated with elevated depressive symptoms: Several survey measures point toward relatively elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety on the STAI is high (score 55, Z = 1.35) and has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most powerful signals here. Self‑esteem is low (RSES = 25, Z = −1.85) and strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.70), another robust indicator that maps onto greater depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52, classified as disturbed sleep), and lower reported current happiness (score 2.0, Z = −1.61) and low health satisfaction (score 2.0, Z ≈ −1.7) further align with patterns commonly seen with higher depressive symptom burden. Additional psychosocial signals — relatively low interpersonal trust (Z = −1.74) and only modest perceived stress (PSS score 21, Z ≈ −0.17 but positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample) — collectively point toward psychosocial strain that is consistent with above‑average CES‑D scores.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors that tend to co-occur with higher CES‑D: Daily recreational habits show heavy internet use and music listening (both Z > 2.0) and above‑average video gaming (Z = 1.71); these activities have small positive correlations with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.24 for internet/music), which may reflect either coping/rumination behaviors or social withdrawal patterns associated with higher symptom levels. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:25) with substantial night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.09), and sleep duration is somewhat shorter than the study mean (median 6 h 44 m, Z = −0.56). The combination of disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular bedtimes, and shortened sleep aligns with established behavioral correlates of increased depressive symptoms (sleep SD and timing variability here also show modest positive correlations with CES‑D).

Physiological and circadian signals relevant to depressive symptomatology: Heart‑rate derived circadian features suggest weakened and less stable daily structure. Interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = −1.56) and amplitude of the circadian fit is reduced (amplitude = 7.57, Z = −1.04), both of which are patterns often associated with greater depressive symptoms or circadian disruption. Resting heart rate and MESOR are near the sample mean (RHR = 58.2 bpm, Z ≈ 0.01; MESOR = 70.7, Z = −0.45); these neutral values are not strong risk signals in this dataset (MESOR has a modest positive correlation with CES‑D, r = 0.20, so the slightly lower MESOR could be weakly protective). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show pronounced daytime/evening elevations (notably a large positive deviation at 5–6 pm, Z = 1.43) and substantial nocturnal dips (largest negative deviations ~3–5 am, Z up to ~1.0). While these hourly deviations reflect normal diurnal modulation of heart rate, the combination of low interdaily stability and reduced amplitude indicates less consistent daily physiological timing, which has been linked in the literature to depressive symptom severity; correlations between these specific wearable circadian metrics and CES‑D in this sample are generally small but point in the same direction.

Behavioral and physiological features that suggest relatively lower depressive symptoms: Some lifestyle and physiological indicators are relatively protective or neutral. Substance use is minimal (no regular beer or recreational drug use; modest weekly wine/liquor), reducing risk associated with substance‑related mood exacerbation. Social exercise is reported at a moderate frequency (exercising with others 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.53) and shows a modest negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ −0.24), suggesting a potential protective social/physical activity buffer. Objective sleep duration and nap behavior are only mildly deviant from the mean (median sleep duration slightly below average; mean daily naps near zero), and resting heart rate is within the typical range for the cohort — these aspects do not strongly point to high symptom burden and may attenuate risk implied by the survey data.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study population mean CES‑D: Weighing the evidence, the balance of strong self‑report indicators (notably high trait anxiety and low self‑esteem, both with strong correlations to CES‑D), poor subjective sleep, low happiness and health satisfaction, and wearable indices of reduced circadian stability and amplitude, suggests that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.24). The strongest contributors to this inference are the STAI and RSES values because of their magnitude and high sample correlations with CES‑D; wearable circadian instability and sleep disturbance provide convergent physiological and behavioral support. Protective elements (minimal substance use, some social exercise, near‑average resting HR and modest sleep duration) mitigate but do not outweigh the weight of the risk‑linked signals.

Limitations and caveats: This assessment synthesizes cross‑sectional survey items and aggregated wearable metrics and is inferential rather than diagnostic. Correlations reported here are sample associations and do not establish causation; some wearable correlations with CES‑D are small or inconsistent. The hourly heart rate values are temporally aggregated and should not be interpreted as time‑specific trends across the semester. For clinical or high‑stakes decision‑making, these findings should be supplemented with a validated CES‑D score for this participant, clinical interview, and longitudinal follow‑up."
97596,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed profile with several strong signals associated with elevated depressive symptoms alongside behavioral patterns and objective metrics that are potentially protective. Key markers of psychological distress include elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56; STAI–CES-D correlation = +0.82), a very high level of self-reported sleep disturbance (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83), high perceived stress (PSS = 32, Z = 2.83) and low momentary happiness (current happy = 2.0, Z = -1.61). Physiological markers that align with increased symptom burden include a modestly elevated resting heart rate/MESOR (resting HR = 63.6, Z = 0.65; MESOR = 77.83, Z = 0.53; both correlate positively with CES-D, r ≈ +0.19) and relatively elevated intraday heart-rate variability (Intradaily Variability = 0.66, Z = 0.81), which can reflect fragmented circadian patterning or greater physiological arousal. Taken together, these signals converge on greater affective and physiological burden than is typical in the sample.

Evidence indicating relatively higher depressive symptoms
The strongest individual indicators pointing toward higher depressive symptomatology are the high trait anxiety (STAI) and very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI). The STAI score is moderately above the sample mean and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = +0.82), indicating that this participant’s anxiety proneness is a robust predictor of elevated depressive symptoms in the study context. The PSQI is markedly elevated (Z = 3.83), indicating clinically significant and atypical subjective sleep disturbance; poor subjective sleep quality in this sample is associated with higher CES-D scores. Elevated perceived stress (Z = 2.83) and low self-reported happiness (Z = -1.61) are additional self-report signals that typically accompany higher CES-D scores. Physiologically, a higher resting heart rate and slightly raised MESOR (both Z ≈ +0.5 to +0.65) and increased intradaily variability (Z = +0.81) are consistent with greater tonic arousal and circadian fragmentation, each of which correl in the sample with increased depressive symptoms (though correlations are smaller than for STAI and PSQI). Certain behavioral correlates—long daily listening to music (Z = +2.06) in this dataset also shows a small positive correlation with CES-D—further add to the cluster of features that tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptom scores.

Evidence indicating relatively lower depressive symptoms
Several objective and behavioral features argue for lower depressive symptom burden or resilience relative to the sample. Wearable sleep duration is relatively long (median sleep 8 h 10 min, Z = +1.22) and sleep-duration variability is low (SD = 60 min, Z = -0.92), suggesting consistent and sufficient objective sleep time across days despite poor subjective sleep quality; mean daily naps are negligible (Z ≈ 0). The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more, Z = +1.07) and moderate social time (socializing 2–3 hours, Z = +0.95), behaviors that are commonly associated with lower depressive symptom levels (exercise shows a small negative correlation with CES-D in this sample). Substance use is low or absent. Circadian summary metrics (amplitude ≈ 10.9, interdaily stability ≈ 0.39, autocorrelation at 24 h ≈ 0.34) are near the sample mean; these modestly structured rhythms and the presence of daily routine elements are factors that, in this dataset, relate to lower likelihood of very high CES-D scores. Self-esteem is not markedly low (Rosenberg = 36, Z = -0.31), and health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z = +0.72), both of which are modestly protective.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Weighing the evidence, the participant presents a constellation in which strong subjective distress markers (high trait anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, and elevated perceived stress) and modest physiological arousal/fragmentation weigh more heavily than the protective signals (adequate objective sleep duration, regularity in sleep duration, frequent exercise, low substance use, and average circadian amplitude). Because the strongest predictors in this dataset (STAI and PSQI) are both markedly elevated and have high correlations with CES-D, the overall balance of evidence indicates a depressive symptom level that is likely above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.26). This conclusion is probabilistic and relative to the study sample: the participant’s profile is consistent with being above the mean CES-D score rather than near or below it, though several behavioral and objective features may mitigate symptom severity and are relevant for intervention or monitoring.

Considerations and caveats
The conclusion integrates self-report and wearable-derived signals and emphasizes measures that, in this sample, have the largest associations with CES-D. Correlations for physiological metrics are modest; therefore, physiological elevations should be interpreted as supporting evidence rather than primary diagnostic indicators. The contrast between long objective sleep duration and very poor subjective sleep quality is notable and suggests sleep fragmentation, non-restorative sleep, or sleep-related complaints that are not fully captured by duration alone—this divergence is clinically relevant because subjective sleep complaints are strongly tied to depressive symptoms in the sample."
57359,"Summary statement
Based on the combination of self-report and wearable-derived metrics, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.31). This inference rests primarily on several trait and functioning indicators that have strong correlations with CES‑D in the study (notably trait anxiety and self‑esteem) and on objective markers of physiological fitness and sleep quantity that are typically protective. That said, there are a number of modest risk signals (subjective sleep disturbance, reduced momentary happiness, greater recreational internet use, and somewhat increased napping) that temper the conclusion. Because an actual CES‑D value for this participant is not shown, the synthesis below integrates directional effects and relative magnitudes (Z‑scores and correlation strengths) rather than presenting a precise CES‑D estimate.

Evidence suggesting lower depressive symptoms
Relatively strong indicators pointing toward lower depressive symptoms include: a STAI–Trait score of 39 (Z = -0.23) and a Rosenberg self‑esteem score of 35 (Z = -0.45). In the study these scales have large correlations with CES‑D (STAI r = 0.81; self‑esteem r = -0.71), so the participant’s lower trait anxiety and higher self‑esteem are salient protective signals. Objective physiological markers also support lower risk: resting heart rate is low at 52.3 bpm (Z = -0.70), and median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 8 min; Z = 1.18). Low perceived stress (PSS = 19; Z = -0.71) and high academic functioning (consistent high GPAs) further indicate preserved daily functioning and coping resources. Circadian amplitude (Z = 0.24) and interdaily stability (Z = 0.17) are near or slightly above average, which together with a clear daytime heart‑rate rise (positive deviations across typical waking hours) indicate an identifiable daytime/active pattern rather than global behavioral withdrawal.

Evidence suggesting higher depressive symptoms or risk
There are several modest indicators that would be interpreted as risk signals or associations with higher CES‑D in the study sample. Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 6; Z = -0.33), and the participant reports lower momentary happiness (current happy = 3.0; Z = -0.53; correlates r ≈ -0.46 with CES‑D), which can reflect affective symptoms. Mean daily naps are elevated relative to peers (mean naps = 0.18; Z = 1.27; r ≈ 0.21), and recreational internet usage is higher than average (2–3 hours; Z = 0.85; r ≈ 0.25) — both behaviors that in this sample are modestly positively associated with CES‑D. Physical social exercise is infrequent (exercised alone 1–2×/month; with others not at all) which could reflect lower behavioral activation even though overall sports participation is moderate. One circadian indicator — autocorrelation at 24 hours — is low (value 0.20; Z = -1.03), suggesting weaker day‑to‑day regularity of heart‑rate rhythms, a feature that has been related to poorer mood regulation in some work. Importantly, the correlations for many of these behavioral indicators with CES‑D are small to moderate, so these are risk signals but not definitive on their own.

Integration and relative weighting
When integrating all sources, greater weight is given to measures that both have strong study correlations with CES‑D and where this participant’s score is clearly favorable (notably trait anxiety and self‑esteem). Objective markers consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and adequate sleep duration also weigh toward lower estimated depressive symptoms. The risk signals (PSQI = 6, lower momentary happiness, increased napping, higher internet use, and low 24‑hour autocorrelation) are present but generally have weaker correlations with CES‑D in the study or are modest in magnitude; they suggest some subclinical distress or behaviors that could increase risk if they persist or worsen, rather than pointing to a high CES‑D score on their own.

Concluding statement relative to the sample
Taking the full pattern into account, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is inferred to be below the population mean CES‑D score (i.e., below 13.31), although not uniformly low across every domain. The strongest protective signals (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low perceived stress, long objective sleep duration, and low resting heart rate) outweigh the modest risk indicators. This is a probabilistic inference rather than a definitive measurement; the presence of subjective sleep disturbance, decreased momentary happiness, and behavioral patterns (napping, higher internet use, low social exercise) merit monitoring because they could shift the balance toward higher symptoms if they increase."
17308,"Summary and overall comparison to sample mean
Based on the combined survey and wearable-derived data, the participant’s pattern of responses and physiology is mixed but leans toward a level of depressive symptoms that is near to modestly above the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.31). This inference rests principally on two strong indicators — elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and elevated perceived stress (PSS) — which are both associated with higher CES‑D scores in this sample. Other measures (self‑esteem, self‑reported happiness, regular sleep duration, frequent exercise, and health satisfaction) provide countervailing evidence that would be expected to protect against higher depressive symptom severity. Because the indicators point in both directions, the most defensible summary is “near or slightly above the population mean,” rather than a clear departure in either direction.

Findings that point toward relatively higher depressive symptomatology
- Elevated trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score is 43 (Z ≈ 0.17) and the STAI–CES‑D correlation in this sample is large (r = 0.81). Even though the participant’s STAI Z‑score is only modestly above the sample mean, the strong association between trait anxiety and depressive symptoms makes this a prominent indicator of increased CES‑D risk.  
- Elevated perceived stress: The Perceived Stress Scale score of 25 (Z ≈ 0.92) is substantially above the sample mean and is positively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.28). Higher chronic stress increases the likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms in this context.  
- Physiological signals with small positive associations: Resting heart rate and mesor are both notably below the sample mean (resting HR = 47.2 bpm, mesor ≈ 60.85) but have small positive correlations with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.19). Although the direction and magnitude of these associations are modest, they slightly favor higher CES‑D when considered alongside the psychological stress/anxiety signals.  
- Some circadian irregularity: Interdaily stability (0.37; Z ≈ −0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.26; Z ≈ −0.53) are lower than the sample mean, which can indicate somewhat weaker day‑to‑day regularity of heart‑rate rhythms; circadian irregularity is often linked to poorer mood in the literature, though correlations here are small.

Findings that point toward relatively lower depressive symptomatology
- Relatively high self‑esteem and positive affect: The Rosenberg self‑esteem score is 37 (Z ≈ −0.17; higher self‑esteem correlates strongly and negatively with CES‑D, r ≈ −0.71), and a current happiness rating of 4.0 (Z ≈ 0.55) is associated with lower CES‑D (r ≈ −0.46). These are substantively protective signals.  
- Sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality: Wearable median sleep duration is adequate (7 h 27 m; Z ≈ 0.33) and PSQI = 5 classifies as relatively good subjective sleep in this sample (PSQI Z ≈ −0.8). Low night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD = 36 min; Z ≈ −1.02) and no daily naps are also consistent with regular, restorative sleep—factors typically associated with lower depressive symptoms.  
- Regular activity and lifestyle factors: Exercise frequency is relatively high (exercising alone three times/week or more; Z ≈ 1.07), limited recreational drug use, moderate alcohol use, and relatively high health satisfaction (score 5.33, Z ≈ 0.8) are all behaviors and perceptions that tend to be associated with lower depressive symptom levels in this sample (correlations are small to moderate but generally protective).  
- Circadian amplitude and intradaily variability: Amplitude is around the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.15) and intradaily variability is near the mean (Z ≈ −0.04), which suggests the participant’s heart‑rate rhythm is not highly fragmented across the day—another signal more consistent with lower symptom burden.

Physiological and circadian interpretation
The participant shows a clear daily heart‑rate rhythm with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:37 PM) and daytime elevations (notably a strong positive deviation around 10–11 AM). Nighttime heart‑rate deviations are appropriately lower (largest negative deviations in the 1–7 AM window), and median sleep duration is adequate. Resting heart rate and mesor are both lower than the sample mean, which can reflect higher cardiovascular fitness or individual set‑point differences; in this sample these lower values have a weak positive correlation with CES‑D, so the physiological signal is ambiguous. Overall, non‑parametric circadian measures (interdaily stability and intradaily variability) do not indicate pronounced rhythm fragmentation; there is some reduction in day‑to‑day regularity (interdaily stability below average) but intraday fragmentation is near average. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:18 AM), consistent with a later chronotype, but sleep timing is relatively consistent across nights.

Holistic synthesis and caveats
Weighing the evidence, the strongest single predictor of depressive symptom burden in this dataset is trait anxiety (STAI) because of its large sample correlation with CES‑D; elevated perceived stress further supports a tendency toward higher depressive symptoms. However, several protective factors—high self‑esteem, self‑reported happiness, regular and sufficient sleep, regular exercise, and subjective health satisfaction—are substantial and argue against a markedly elevated CES‑D score. Physiological circadian measures are largely within typical ranges and do not provide strong evidence of mood‑related dysregulation. Taken together, these mixed signals most consistently point to depressive symptomatology that is around the sample mean or modestly higher than the mean (i.e., “near to slightly above” the population mean CES‑D of 13.31), rather than clearly low or clearly high.

Limitations
These inferences are probabilistic and rely on cross‑sectional correlations and aggregated wearable summaries. They are not a diagnostic assessment and do not replace direct clinical evaluation or a contemporaneous CES‑D score for the participant. If the goal is to more precisely place this individual on the CES‑D scale, obtaining the actual CES‑D score or repeated symptom assessments would reduce uncertainty."
51851,"Protective features that point toward relatively lower depressive symptom burden
The participant shows multiple robust indicators that, in the study sample, are associated with lower CES‑D scores. Trait anxiety on the STAI–Trait is modest (score = 35, z = −0.62) despite the STAI’s strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81); lower trait anxiety is therefore an important protective factor. Self‑esteem is elevated relative to the cohort (RSES z = +1.10) and has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71), making it a particularly influential protective signal. Frequent physical activity and sports (exercise with others and alone both reported ≥ three times/week; exercise-related z-scores > +1.0) and high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction z = +1.63) are additional behavioral and perceptual assets that, given their negative correlations with depressive symptoms in the sample, support a lower inferred CES‑D level. Objective cardiac physiology is also shifted toward lower overall cardiovascular tone: resting heart rate is unusually low (41.1 bpm, z = −2.03) and mesor is low (60.05, z = −1.90); in this dataset those lower values are weakly associated with lower depressive symptoms, consistent with greater fitness or low physiological arousal as a protective context. Low use of recreational or non‑prescribed drugs, modest alcohol consumption, and limited sedentary leisure time further align with lower risk patterns in the cohort.

Risk features that point toward relatively higher depressive symptom burden
There are several signals that point in the opposite direction and that should temper interpretation. Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 8, z ≈ +0.59), and poor sleep quality is commonly associated with higher CES‑D scores; the PSQI value here therefore increases estimated risk. The participant reports lower momentary happiness (current happiness z ≈ −0.53) and reduced interpersonal trust (trust z = −1.42), the latter of which correlates moderately with higher CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ −0.41). Circadian and activity‑rhythm measures also show aspects that have been linked to depressive symptoms: interdaily stability is below average (value 0.32, z = −0.74) while intradaily variability is elevated (value 0.72, z = +1.23), indicating less stable and more fragmented 24‑hour patterns of activity/heart rate. Sleep timing is relatively late on average (median sleep start ≈ 00:56) with moderately elevated night‑to‑night variability in sleep onset (sleep start SD z ≈ +0.61); these timing irregularities are risk-relevant because they frequently co-occur with mood symptoms. While many of these wearable circadian metrics have only small direct correlations with CES‑D in this sample, collectively they constitute behavioral and physiological patterns that are often seen in higher symptom presentations.

Physiological and sleep pattern synthesis
Objective sleep duration is close to seven hours (median 6 h 57 min, z ≈ −0.28) with a moderate night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD ~86 min), suggesting that total sleep time is not severely curtailed but is somewhat inconsistent. Wearable hourly heart‑rate deviations show expected nocturnal troughs and daytime/evening elevations; the participant’s evening relative elevations (several hours with positive deviations and a late acrophase at ~4:57 PM) together with the late median sleep onset support a pattern of later-day arousal and irregular timing. The combination of subjective sleep disturbances (PSQI) and objective rhythm fragmentation (low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, variable sleep start) is a plausible pathway linking behavioral schedule disruption to elevated symptom risk even where average sleep duration is near normative levels.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the strongest single signals in this record favor a relatively lower level of depressive symptoms: low trait anxiety, notably high self‑esteem (a variable with a strong negative association with CES‑D), frequent exercise, high health satisfaction, and low substance use. Counterbalancing that, there are meaningful risk indicators—disturbed subjective sleep, lower reported happiness, low interpersonal trust, and measurable circadian irregularity—that suggest some vulnerability to mood symptoms. On net, given the relative magnitude and strength of the predictors in this dataset (particularly the large negative association between self‑esteem and CES‑D and the strong positive association between trait anxiety and CES‑D, both of which are favorable here), the participant’s pattern is most consistent with an inferred CES‑D level below the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31). This conclusion is probabilistic: it indicates a likelihood of fewer depressive symptoms than the average cohort member rather than absence of any symptoms.

Implications
The profile suggests attention to sleep timing regularity and subjective sleep quality may be the most actionable areas if minimizing depressive symptom risk is the goal, while maintaining current levels of physical activity and social engagement and supporting self‑esteem and low anxiety appear to be protective strengths."
77872,"Summary of likely depressive-symptom signals (protective / lower CES-D)
- Multiple robust self-report indicators point toward relatively low depressive symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82) is well below the study mean and the STAI ↔ CES-D correlation in this sample is strongly positive (r = 0.81), which makes the low STAI score a relatively strong protective sign. Self‑esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 0.82) and the self‑esteem ↔ CES-D correlation is strongly negative (r = -0.71), another substantial protective factor. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) is on the “good” side of the distribution and therefore tends to predict lower CES‑D in this sample.
- Wearable-derived circadian and sleep regularity metrics further support lower depressive symptoms. Intradaily variability of heart rate is low (Value = 0.36, Z = -1.31), indicating relatively little within‑day fragmentation of physiological activity; amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm is relatively high (Amplitude Z = 0.75), and interdaily stability is near the mean (Z = -0.08). These features (especially lower fragmentation and preserved amplitude) are generally associated with healthier circadian organization and in this dataset are weakly linked to lower CES‑D scores. Low night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep duration SD Z = -0.84) and essentially no napping (Mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86) are additional behavioral markers that, in this sample, correlate with lower depressive symptom burden.

Signals that tend to indicate relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Some behavioral and affective signals point modestly in the opposite direction. The participant’s current self‑reported happiness is somewhat below average (Happy Z = -0.53; Happy ↔ CES‑D r = -0.46), which modestly aligns with higher depressive symptoms. Average nightly sleep duration (median 6 h 50 min, Z = -0.44) is slightly shorter than the group mean; shorter sleep duration can be associated with greater symptom burden, though the effect here is small and subjective sleep quality remained acceptable.
- Social activity and sport engagement are limited: the participant reports low time socializing (Z = -0.62) and no organized sports (Z = -1.09). Reduced social/sport engagement can be associated with elevated CES‑D in some contexts; in this dataset the direct correlations for these particular items are small, but they do represent behavioral patterns that could contribute to symptom risk if they persist.
- A chronobiological risk feature to note is the participant’s late median sleep start time ( ~01:58 AM). Late habitual bedtime itself is not a direct strong correlate in the provided correlations, but when combined with slightly elevated mesor (MESOR = 78.7 bpm, Z = 0.65) and modestly higher aggregate evening heart‑rate deviations (e.g., 5–6pm and late evening Zs), it suggests a circadian timing profile shifted later than typical, which in other work can be linked to mood vulnerability. The wearable correlations to CES‑D for mesor and resting HR are small-to-moderate (r ≈ 0.19), so these are secondary signals rather than primary drivers.

Integration and overall comparison to the study sample
- Taking the full multimodal profile together, the strongest and most informative indicators (low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem, good subjective sleep quality, low intradaily variability and preserved circadian amplitude, low sleep variability, and absence of daytime napping) converge toward an inference of depressive symptom levels that are at or below the study population mean. Several of these features have comparatively large correlations with CES‑D in this sample (notably STAI and self‑esteem), and they consistently point in the protective direction.
- Balancing the modest risk signals (lower reported happiness, somewhat short sleep duration, late bedtimes, limited socializing) against the stronger protective signals, the overall pattern is most consistent with a CES‑D score below the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31). Because no direct CES‑D value for this participant was provided, this statement is probabilistic and based on the relative weight of features and their sample correlations rather than on a direct score.
- Practical considerations: the principal areas that could be monitored for early change are sleep timing (habitual late bedtime), subjective positive affect (current happiness), and social engagement — each of these showed weaker but plausible links to higher CES‑D in the dataset. Conversely, the participant’s high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, and stable circadian physiology represent notable resilience factors.

Limitations
- This inference is integrative and correlational: it relies on associations present in the study sample and the participant’s relative Z‑scores rather than on a measured CES‑D score for the individual. Stronger inference would require a contemporaneous CES‑D measure or repeated symptom assessment."
72348,"Summary
The participant presents a mixed but overall reassuring multi-modal profile with regard to depressive symptoms. Several robust protective signals emerge from the self-report and wearable data (notably higher self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, long and regular nocturnal sleep, and strong circadian stability), while a smaller set of indicators point toward increased risk (subjective sleep disturbance, modestly elevated perceived stress, lower momentary happiness, and a mildly elevated resting heart rate). When these lines of evidence are integrated, the balance of probabilities favors a level of depressive symptoms that is at or modestly below the study sample mean (sample mean CES‑D = 13.33), though some features suggest monitoring or follow‑up could be indicated.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Subjective sleep quality: The participant’s PSQI score is 8 (Z = 0.59; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating measurable subjective sleep problems despite objectively long sleep duration. Poor subjective sleep commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptomatology and thus is a risk-relevant signal in this profile.  
- Affective and stress indicators: Current self‑reported happiness is below the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is slightly elevated (PSS = 22, Z = 0.10). Lower momentary positive affect and elevated stress are both associated with higher CES‑D in population data and thus constitute modest risk factors here.  
- Physiological arousal: Resting heart rate and mesor are above the sample average (resting HR = 71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55; MESOR = 86.31, Z = 1.69). These cardiovascular indices have small positive correlations with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.2) in the study sample; elevated resting autonomic tone can reflect increased physiological arousal that is sometimes observed in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Trait and self‑concept measures: The Rosenberg Self‑Esteem score is high (34; Z = -0.59 relative to lower depression risk) and the trait anxiety score is not elevated (STAI = 39; Z = -0.23, classified “not anxious”). Self‑esteem has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71) and trait anxiety correlates strongly positive with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81); the participant’s favorable scores on these two measures are substantial protective indicators against higher depressive symptom burden.  
- Behavioral health and academic functioning: The participant reports minimal substance use, strong academic performance (GPAs ~3.6–3.93), and no napping; these behavioral markers are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms in many samples. Low alcohol/drug use and preserved academic functioning weigh against a high CES‑D score.  
- Objective sleep regularity and circadian robustness: Wearable-derived sleep shows a long median sleep duration (8 h 22 min, Z = 1.48) and low night-to-night variability in both duration (SD = 39 min, Z = -1.40) and start time (SD = 26 min, Z = -1.24). Circadian/24‑hour activity metrics are strongly regular (interdaily stability = 0.65, Z = 1.99; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 2.49) and intradaily variability is lower than typical (Z = -0.81). Regular, consolidated sleep and strong day‑to‑day rhythmicity are commonly linked with lower depressive symptoms and thus are important protective features in this case.

Additional physiologic and behavioral nuance
- Heart rate hourly deviations and amplitude: The participant’s aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir and a pronounced morning elevation by 8–10am. Amplitude is near sample average (Z = 0.23). These aggregated circadian features reflect a well‑phased cardiac rhythm (acrophase ≈ 3:25 PM) rather than the flattened or phase‑shifted rhythms sometimes associated with depression.  
- Sedentary and screen‑based habits: The participant reports higher-than-average sedentary hobby time and internet use (internet use Z = 1.52, sedentary hobby Z = 1.41). These behaviors have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample and represent potential behavioral risk factors that could contribute over time if they displace active or social behaviors.

Holistic interpretation relative to the sample mean CES‑D
Taking all modalities together, the preponderance of protective signals (notably high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, preserved academic functioning, long and stable nocturnal sleep, and strong circadian regularity) outweigh the set of modest risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, slightly elevated stress and resting HR, lower momentary happiness, and sedentary/screen behaviors). Therefore the most defensible inference from the available data is that the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely at or somewhat below the study sample mean CES‑D (i.e., below the population mean of 13.33), rather than substantially above it. Confidence in this conclusion is moderate because several risk signals are present and because correlations are population‑level associations rather than proofs of individual status.

Limitations and caveats
- No direct CES‑D value for the participant was provided; this assessment is an inference synthesized from related measures and their sample correlations.  
- Correlations reported are population‑level and do not establish causation or precise individual prediction.  
- Hourly aggregated heart‑rate data are temporally averaged across days and cannot reveal within‑period shifts or episodic events.  
- Subjective vs. objective sleep signals are partly discrepant (subjective disturbance despite long, regular sleep), so further inquiry into sleep quality, daytime functioning, and factors like sleep fragmentation or mood reactivity would clarify risk.

If desired, I can: (1) summarize the key protective and risk indicators as a short checklist for monitoring, or (2) propose specific follow‑up questions or short assessments (e.g., CES‑D instrument, sleep fragmentation measures, brief behavioral activation/exercise log) to reduce uncertainty about current depressive symptom level."
89607,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics the participant shows a mixed profile with both risk-related and protective features for depressive symptoms. Notable risk indicators include elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), together with an elevated resting heart rate (68.6 bpm, Z = 1.24). Protective and resilience-related features include relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26), frequent exercise (three times/week or more, Zs 1.07–1.58), regular daily structure as indexed by high interdaily stability (0.56, Z = 1.24), and objectively long but regular nocturnal sleep (median 8 h 12 min, Z = 1.26; sleep duration SD = 65 min, Z = -0.81). These mixed signals require integrating both behavioral and physiological data to estimate likely depressive symptom burden.

Factors that are consistent with relatively higher CES-D scores
Several features point toward a tendency for higher depressive symptom scores. The participant’s trait anxiety is substantially elevated (STAI Z = 0.76) and the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r = 0.81), making elevated anxiety a potent predictor of elevated depressive symptomatology in this sample. The PSQI score of 7 indicates subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI > 5), and subjective sleep complaints often co-occur with higher CES-D. Physiologically, the participant’s resting heart rate and MESOR are above the study mean (RHR Z = 1.24; MESOR Z = 0.87), and both show small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), which can reflect chronic autonomic arousal associated with affective distress. The participant’s sleep timing is very late (median sleep start ~02:02 AM) despite consistent timing, and increased daytime napping (mean daily naps 0.18, Z = 1.27) plus some sedentary leisure use (video games and sedentary hobbies Zs >1) can also be seen in profiles with higher depressive symptoms. Taken together, the combination of elevated anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, elevated resting heart rate, and late sleep timing provides multiple signals that are associated with higher CES-D in this cohort.

Factors that are consistent with relatively lower CES-D scores
There are several notable protective indicators. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample (r = -0.71), which is a robust buffer against depressive symptoms. The participant reports regular, frequent exercise both alone and with others (Zs 1.07–1.58), and exercise shows negative correlations with CES-D; physical activity and social exercise are well-established protective factors. Objective circadian rhythm metrics point to structured, stable rhythms: interdaily stability is high (0.56, Z = 1.24) and intradaily variability is relatively low (0.45, Z = -0.67), indicating consistent day-to-day timing and low fragmentation — patterns typically associated with better mood regulation. Self-reported current happiness is above the mean (score = 4, Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is not elevated (PSS score 20, Z = -0.44), while substance use is minimal; these behavioral and affective data are consistent with lower depressive symptom risk.

Wearable circadian and hourly heart-rate profile: interpretation
Heart-rate cosinor parameters show a clear day–night rhythm with an acrophase in the late afternoon (5:14 PM) and lower amplitude than the population mean (Amplitude Z = -0.36). The aggregated hourly deviations are consistent with an expected overnight trough and daytime elevation; midday and early-afternoon hours show the largest positive deviations from MESOR (12–2 pm highest), and overnight hours show the largest negative deviations (2–7 am). The overall pattern is of a robust, regular rhythm (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability) despite a later-than-typical sleep onset. Elevated MESOR and resting heart rate suggest higher baseline cardiovascular activation, which modestly correlates with CES-D in this sample, but the strong rhythm regularity argues against circadian fragmentation commonly associated with more severe depressive presentations.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean CES-D
Balancing the evidence, the most influential risk signal is the participant’s elevated trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES-D) and subjective sleep disturbance accompanied by elevated resting heart rate; these point toward a tendency for depressive symptoms above the typical level. Offsetting these risks are high self-esteem, frequent exercise, regular circadian structure, and moderate self-reported happiness. Integrating these sources, the profile is best characterized as mildly elevated depressive symptom risk relative to the study sample. In other words, based on the pattern of predictors available, the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is likely slightly above the population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.28). This inference acknowledges both the strong anxiety-related signal elevating risk and the meaningful protective factors that likely limit the severity of depressive symptoms.

Limitations and recommended next steps
This inference is probabilistic and indirect: no contemporaneous CES-D score for the participant was provided, wearable indices are temporally aggregated, and correlations do not establish causation. The strongest single predictor in this dataset is trait anxiety (STAI), so direct screening with a CES-D or clinical interview would be the most informative next step to confirm symptom level. Given the combination of sleep complaints and elevated resting heart rate, targeted assessment of sleep quality and autonomic symptoms (and brief interventions for anxiety and sleep timing) could be warranted."
59900,"Summary
The participant’s profile shows a mixture of risk and protective indicators for depressive symptoms. The most striking signal is severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 14, z = 3.37) together with objectively long but irregular sleep (median nightly sleep ≈ 9 h 22 m, z = 2.71; high night-to-night variability, SD ≈ 169 min, z = 1.55). Several circadian-heart-rate features indicate a relatively blunted and less-regular daily physiological rhythm (reduced amplitude, lower interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation), although many wearable-derived correlations with CES-D are small. Trait and behavioral measures include several protective features (high self‑esteem and current happiness, modest perceived stress, no recreational drug use, good academic performance). Taken together, the pattern is most consistent with a participant whose depressive symptom burden is around the study sample mean, with specific sleep-related problems that could push scores somewhat higher than average.

Factors that indicate relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Severe subjective sleep problems: the PSQI score of 14 (z = 3.37) is markedly above the sample and is a robust risk indicator for depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep disturbance is a well-established correlate of higher CES‑D scores and is the single strongest abnormality in this dataset.  
- Long and unstable sleep schedule: the wearable median sleep duration is substantially longer than the sample average (≈9 h 22 m, z = 2.71) and night-to-night start time and duration variability are elevated (sleep SD z = 1.55; start-time SD z = 1.19). Protracted sleep duration and high variability are both associated with mood symptoms and are concordant with the PSQI finding. The positive correlation of sleep variability with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.20) suggests this irregularity is relevant.  
- Blunted/irregular circadian physiology: amplitude is reduced (z ≈ −0.81), interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are lower than average (z ≈ −0.74 and −1.29 respectively). These features point to a less robust, less consistent circadian pattern in heart rate—patterns that have been associated with elevated depressive symptoms in population studies (even though correlations in this sample are modest).  
- Low reported health satisfaction and low physical activity: health satisfaction is relatively low (score 2.67, z ≈ −1.2) and the participant reports essentially no exercise or sports (z-scores strongly negative). Reduced perceived health and lack of regular exercise are behavioral factors that tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptom levels.

Factors that indicate relatively lower depressive symptoms
- High self‑esteem and positive affect: Rosenberg self‑esteem is high (39; z ≈ 0.11) and current happiness is above average (score 4; z ≈ 0.55). In this sample these scales are inversely correlated with CES‑D (self‑esteem r ≈ −0.71; happiness r ≈ −0.46), making them substantial protective signals.  
- Relatively low trait anxiety and perceived stress: the STAI–Trait score (37, classified “not anxious”) is below the population mean (z ≈ −0.43) and perceived stress is not elevated (PSS z ≈ −0.71). Lower chronic anxiety and lower stress appraisals reduce the probability of a high CES‑D score here. Note that STAI and CES‑D are highly correlated at the population level (r ≈ 0.81), but the participant’s actual STAI score is not elevated.  
- Functional indicators and low substance risk: the participant shows evidence of preserved daytime functioning (good GPAs) and reports no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use; alcohol use is moderate and typical for the sample. These elements are not consistent with major functional impairment and tend to be associated with lower CES‑D scores.

Physiological pattern interpretation
The heart-rate circadian summary shows lower amplitude and reduced day-to-day regularity, with an acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:37 PM) and resting heart rate within a typical range (≈59 bpm). Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nighttime trough and daytime elevations; correlations of these hourly deviations with CES‑D are generally small. Physiologically, the profile suggests a blunted circadian rhythm and inconsistency across days rather than overt autonomic hyperarousal. In isolation these circadian features are mild-to-moderate risk factors for higher depressive symptom burden, but their predictive weight is smaller here than the participant’s very elevated subjective sleep complaint.

Overall inference relative to the study sample mean
Considering the full multimodal profile, the participant’s data are most consistent with a CES‑D level near the study population mean (population mean = 13.31, SD = 9.62). The severe subjective sleep disturbance and objective sleep irregularity are the strongest indicators that depressive symptoms could be elevated relative to peers, while high self‑esteem, above‑average current happiness, relatively low trait anxiety and good functional indicators argue against a markedly elevated CES‑D score. Overall I would characterize the participant’s depressive-symptom level as near the population mean, with a specific risk of modest elevation driven primarily by sleep-related problems.

Recommendations for further interpretation
Because the strongest and most clinically relevant signal here is severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 14) coupled with long but irregular sleep, targeted follow-up on sleep (timing, quality, daytime functioning, and possible hypersomnia vs. compensatory sleep) would clarify whether depressive symptoms are rising. A concurrent self-report CES‑D score (if not already obtained), a brief clinical interview focused on mood and sleep, and consideration of behavioral sleep regularization or a sleep-focused clinical assessment would be the most direct next steps to resolve the mixed signals in this multimodal profile."
28254,"Summary
The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of protective psychological traits and behavioral/physiological features that can be associated with elevated mood symptoms. The strongest protective signals are very low trait anxiety (STAI = 32, Z = -0.92) and high self‑esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26); both measures have large correlations with CES‑D in the sample (STAI r = 0.81, self‑esteem r = -0.71) and therefore carry substantial weight in predicting lower depressive symptomatology. Countervailing signals include subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), measurable circadian irregularity (reduced interdaily stability and reduced amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm), somewhat shorter median nightly sleep (6 h 45 m, Z = -0.53), and modestly elevated resting heart rate (61.9 bpm, Z = 0.45). The following paragraphs enumerate the more salient indicators that point toward higher versus lower depressive symptoms and then integrate them into an overall inference relative to the study population mean CES‑D (mean = 13.33).

Factors suggesting a relatively higher CES‑D score
- Sleep complaints and timing variability: The participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed), with a median sleep start near 00:50 and high variability in sleep onset (sleep start SD = 122 minutes, Z = 0.86). Sleep disturbance and irregular sleep timing are both associated with greater depressive symptoms in the literature and in this dataset (sleep start variability correlates positively with CES‑D, r ≈ 0.22). Although total nightly duration is only mildly short, subjective sleep difficulties and variable bedtimes are notable risk signals.
- Circadian rhythm attenuation and reduced regularity: Wearable-derived circadian metrics show relatively low interdaily stability (0.28, Z = -1.07) and reduced rhythm amplitude (8.37, Z = -0.78). Reduced amplitude and less regular daily structure are plausible physiological correlates of elevated depressive symptoms; in this dataset amplitude has a small negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.10). The rhythm profile indicates blunted day–night contrast in heart rate, which can be consistent with disrupted behavioral/physiological rhythms.
- Mildly elevated resting heart rate: Resting HR (61.9 bpm, Z = 0.45) is modestly above the study mean and correlates positively with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting a small physiological signal in the direction of greater symptom burden.
- Reduced evening physiological activation: The hourly heart‑rate deviations show relatively low evening increases (6–10 pm hours near or below mesor), which may reflect lower evening activity or arousal; several evening hourly deviations have strongly negative Z‑scores. Although correlations of specific hourly deviations with CES‑D are small, the pattern can be interpreted as reduced evening engagement/activation in some participants.

Factors suggesting a relatively lower CES‑D score
- Low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem: Two of the strongest protective signals are the participant’s low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -0.92) and maximal self‑esteem score (RSES = 40). Given the large sample correlations (STAI–CES‑D r = 0.81; self‑esteem–CES‑D r = -0.71), these measures strongly predict lower depressive symptoms and weigh heavily in the overall inference.
- Low perceived stress and positive health satisfaction: The participant reports relatively low perceived stress (PSS = 19, Z = -0.71) and above‑average satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = 0.55), both of which are associated with lower CES‑D scores in the sample (health satisfaction r ≈ -0.39). These self‑reports indicate adaptive appraisal and perceived well‑being.
- Behavioral and social factors without strong risk signals: The participant reports no recreational drug use and only moderate alcohol use; physical activity is present (exercising alone 1–2×/week). Although socializing time is below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.62), correlations between socializing and CES‑D in this dataset are negligible. Overall, lifestyle data do not show pronounced behavioral risk that would strongly elevate CES‑D above the population mean.

Holistic inference relative to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most highly predictive measures (low STAI and high RSES) favor a notably lower level of depressive symptoms relative to others in this sample. Sleep disturbance, circadian attenuation, and a modestly elevated resting heart rate provide countervailing signals that push in the direction of greater symptoms, but these have smaller sample correlations with CES‑D and therefore less predictive weight in this dataset. Taken together, the multimodal pattern suggests the participant is likely at or below the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.33). In other words, the aggregate evidence is most consistent with depressive symptom levels near to or somewhat below the population average, with sleep and circadian irregularity representing the primary areas of vulnerability despite otherwise protective psychological characteristics.

Interpretive caveats
This is an inferential synthesis, not a diagnostic determination. The participant’s actual CES‑D score was not provided here; the conclusion is based on weighted patterns of correlates in the sample (not causal proof). Measures with the largest sample correlations (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) were given relatively greater influence in the overall inference; physiological signals and sleep metrics were treated as secondary contributors given smaller correlations. If direct CES‑D data or clinical interview information become available, they should supersede this probabilistic, multimodal interpretation."
35347,"Protective features linked with lower depressive symptoms
The participant’s self-report and trait measures contain several relatively strong indicators associated with lower CES-D scores. Trait anxiety on the STAI is low (score = 31, Z = -1.02), which—given the strong positive correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D in the sample—is a substantial signal in the direction of fewer depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem appears elevated relative to the study sample (Rosenberg score reported with Z = 0.96), and self‑esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in this cohort (r ≈ -0.71), so this profile points toward lower depressive symptom burden. Behavioral social resources also appear present: reported time socializing with friends is above sample mean (3–4 hours, Z = 1.74), which is typically a protective contextual factor. On the physiological side, the participant’s resting heart rate is within the sample average-to-low range (57.8 bpm, Z ≈ -0.04), and overall circadian amplitude and interdaily stability are modestly above the sample mean (amplitude Z = 0.63; interdaily stability Z = 0.33), indicating a relatively preserved and reasonably regular heart‑rate rhythm—features that are generally more consistent with lower depressive symptomatology than with severe rhythm disruption.

Risk features linked with higher depressive symptoms
Several behavioral and sleep-related indicators point in the opposite direction, suggesting risk for elevated depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 6), which often co-occurs with higher CES‑D scores. The participant’s sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:12) and sleep timing variability is moderate; late chronotype and irregular sleep timing are commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms. Sleep duration variability is relatively high (SD ≈ 146 minutes, Z = 1.04) and mean daily naps are elevated (0.3 naps/day, Z = 2.66)—both of which correlate positively with CES‑D in the sample (sleep variability r ≈ 0.20; naps r ≈ 0.22) and can index fragmented or compensatory sleep. Low physical activity is evident in self‑report (exercise “less than 1–2 times a month,” Zs ≪ 0), which has a small negative correlation with CES‑D in this dataset and is a well‑recognized behavioral risk factor. High daily internet use (>4 hours, Z = 2.19) is another behavioral variable that correlates positively with CES‑D here and may reflect more sedentary and ruminative behavior patterns. Interpersonal trust is markedly low (Z = -2.07); given its negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample, reduced trust may be associated with higher symptom levels. The participant’s current self‑rated happiness is below average (Z = -0.53), and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 22, Z = 0.1), both consistent with increased symptom burden.

Physiological and circadian pattern interpretation
Wearable-derived hourly heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced daytime/evening peak (notably a strong positive deviation around 6–7 pm, Z ≈ 1.75) and deep overnight troughs (largest negative deviations in the early morning hours). The overall cosinor mesor is slightly elevated (77.1, Z = 0.43) and amplitude is modestly above average (Z = 0.63). These features indicate a detectable daily rhythm with a strong evening arousal signature rather than a flattened, arrhythmic pattern. Circadian non‑parametric measures (interdaily stability ≈ 0.45; intradaily variability ≈ 0.55) are near the sample average, suggesting the participant’s day‑to‑day heart‑rate rhythm is neither highly irregular nor extremely stable. In combination with the subjective sleep disturbances (late timing and frequent naps), the wearable data suggest preserved circadian amplitude but with late‑timed activity/arousal and some sleep fragmentation—an arrangement that can be associated with subthreshold or situational depressive symptoms rather than severe, global dysregulation.

Holistic assessment relative to the study sample mean CES‑D
When the pattern of indicators is integrated, the dataset contains both meaningful protective signals (notably low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem, stable social engagement, and a preserved circadian amplitude) and a set of moderate risk markers (disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, high sleep variability and naps, low exercise, high internet use, and low interpersonal trust). Weighting these signals by their predictive strength in the sample (for example the strong negative association of self‑esteem and the strong positive association of trait anxiety with CES‑D) suggests that the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely near or modestly below the study population mean rather than substantially above it. Stated with reference to the sample mean CES‑D = 13.32 (SD = 9.62), the combined evidence most consistently supports an inferred symptom level at or slightly lower than the population average.

Caveats and recommendations for interpretation
This synthesis is probabilistic and based on multi‑modal correlational signals rather than a direct CES‑D score for the individual. Several behavioral markers with only small sample correlations to CES‑D (e.g., internet use, naps) should be interpreted cautiously, and some self‑report metrics contain atypical scaling or extreme Z values that warrant verification. If clinical or research decisions depend on precise symptom quantification, direct administration of CES‑D or clinician assessment combined with sleep diaries and an objective activity log across several weeks would reduce uncertainty and clarify whether the observed sleep timing and nap behavior reflect transient semester demands versus more persistent patterns."
45641,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of relatively strong psychological risk indicators (notably elevated trait anxiety and reduced self-esteem), behavioral patterns commonly associated with depressed mood (low social and exercise engagement, high sedentary leisure), and physiological markers that are partly mixed — preserved circadian regularity and adequate total nightly sleep duration but elevated evening and resting cardiovascular arousal. Taken together and weighted by the strength of instrument-level associations with CES‑D in this sample, the balance of evidence suggests a higher-than-average level of depressive symptoms relative to the study population.

Features consistent with higher depressive symptom burden: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46) and reduced self‑esteem (RSES = 32; Z = −0.87). In the study sample these two measures show strong correlations with CES‑D (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self‑esteem r ≈ −0.71), so they are particularly informative and indicate increased risk. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38; r ≈ 0.28), and current self‑reported happiness is below average (score = 3; Z = −0.53; r ≈ −0.46), both aligning with greater depressive symptomatology. Lifestyle measures that typically associate with higher CES‑D are present: very low frequency of exercise and sports (exercise frequencies with Z-scores around −1.1 to −1.2), low time socializing with friends (Z = −1.41), and relatively high time in sedentary hobbies (2–3 hours, Z = 2.01). Subjective sleep quality meets the common “disturbed” cutoff (PSQI = 7), which is another indicator often linked to depressive symptoms. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mesor are modestly elevated (resting HR = 63.2 bpm, Z = 0.6; mesor = 80.02, Z = 0.83), and the hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show pronounced evening/night arousal (notably large positive deviations around 9–11 pm and a raised 12–1 am value; e.g., 9–10 pm deviation = 18.5; Z = 1.83). Elevated evening arousal together with a very late median sleep start (median sleep start ≈ 01:59) is consistent with behavioral and physiological patterns that can accompany depressive mood or insomnia-related disturbance.

Features consistent with lower depressive symptom burden: Several wearable-derived circadian measures point toward preserved daily organization, which is generally protective. Interdaily stability is relatively high (value = 0.58; Z = 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (value = 0.42; Z = 0.81), indicating consistent day-to-day structure in heart‑rate rhythms. Intradaily variability is moderately low (value = 0.47; Z = −0.53), suggesting limited within‑day fragmentation of activity/arousal. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is near the upper range of normal (7 hours 54 minutes; Z = 0.89) and night‑to‑night variability in sleep start time is not elevated (SD ≈ 50 minutes; Z = −0.73); mean daily naps are essentially zero (Z = −0.86). These objective signals — regular circadian rhythm, adequate nightly duration, low napping — are factors that tend to mitigate depressive symptom severity in group analyses. In the physiological domain, the cosinor amplitude is present (amplitude = 13.3; Z = 0.81), indicating a measurable day–night contrast rather than a flattened rhythm, and several hourly deviations during daytime show expected positive departures from the mesor, consistent with normal daytime activation.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the population mean CES‑D: Weighting the relative strengths of evidence (notably the very large sample correlations for trait anxiety and self‑esteem), the psychological self‑report profile strongly suggests elevated depressive symptoms. Behavioral indices (low exercise/social engagement, high sedentary hobby time) and elevated evening/bedtime heart‑rate arousal further support a higher symptom estimate. Countervailing evidence from the wearables — good sleep duration, strong interdaily stability, low intradaily fragmentation, and preserved rhythm amplitude — are meaningful protective signals but, given the magnitude of the psychological risk markers, likely insufficient to offset the risk indicated by the self‑reports. Therefore, when compared to the study sample mean CES‑D score of 13.28 (SD = 9.61), the participant’s multimodal pattern is most consistent with a CES‑D level above the population mean. This is an inference about relative symptom level only and not a diagnostic statement; direct CES‑D score and clinical evaluation are required for definitive assessment."
64572,"Summary conclusion
Based on the pattern of self-report and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological indicators, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.33). This inference rests primarily on several strong protective indicators (notably low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem) together with objectively regular circadian/behavioral rhythms and low resting heart rate. Below I summarize the evidence that pulls toward higher versus lower CES‑D scores and then integrate these lines of evidence with attention to effect sizes and correlations.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Sleep complaints and short habitual sleep: The PSQI score is 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), and wearable median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 38 min (Z = −0.69), both suggest relatively shortened and subjectively disturbed sleep. Sleep disturbance and short sleep often associate with elevated CES‑D scores; here sleep start variability shows a positive correlation with CES‑D (sleep start SD correlation = 0.21), indicating that greater irregularity in timing is associated with higher depressive symptoms in the sample (though this participant’s sleep start SD is modestly low, Z = −0.61).  
- Elevated perceived stress and lower momentary happiness: The Perceived Stress score (22; Z = 0.10) is somewhat elevated relative to the sample and correlates positively with CES‑D (r = 0.28), and the participant’s current happiness rating is below the sample mean (3.0; Z = −0.53) with a moderate negative correlation with CES‑D (r = −0.46). These affective/cognitive self‑reports point to some ongoing stress and reduced positive affect that are risk‑relevant.  
- Some wearable heart‑rate associations weakly in risk direction: A few nocturnal and early‑morning heart‑rate deviations show small positive correlations with CES‑D (e.g., hours where heart rate remains less suppressed overnight have small positive correlations, up to r ≈ 0.16), suggesting a modest association between lower nocturnal HR decline and higher symptoms in the sample. The magnitude of these associations is small.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem (strong protective signals): Trait anxiety (STAI = 35; Z = −0.62) is below the sample mean and the STAI–CES‑D correlation is large (r = 0.81). High self‑esteem (Rosenberg score = 42; Z = 0.54) is above the sample mean and strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71). Given the large correlations, these two indicators provide substantial evidence that this participant is likely to have lower depressive symptom scores relative to the sample.  
- Regular and robust circadian organization: Wearable measures show high interdaily stability (0.61; Z = 1.66), low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.53; Z = −0.11), a clear amplitude (12.3; Z = 0.49) and a typical acrophase (≈4:57 PM). High day‑to‑day regularity (interdaily stability) is generally protective against affective symptoms and here is well above the sample mean (Z = 1.66). These objective rhythm metrics reduce the likelihood of circadian dysregulation that often accompanies higher CES‑D scores.  
- Low resting heart rate and lower overall mesor: Resting HR is relatively low (50.3 bpm; Z = −0.93) and the heart‑rate mesor is also lower than average (67.23; Z = −0.92). Lower resting HR and the pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate drop (large negative deviations overnight) are consistent with good cardiovascular fitness/somatic functioning in many contexts and are not typical markers of elevated depressive symptomatology.  
- Low substance use and modest social/physical activity: The participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use (Zs around −1.1 to −0.3), engages in exercise/sports roughly 1–2 times per week (sports Z = 0.91), and spends a modest amount of time socializing with friends (1–2 hours; Z = 0.16). These behavioral patterns are weak-to-moderately protective and align with lower CES‑D scores in the sample (correlations are small but generally in the protective direction).

Integrated interpretation and relative weighting
When weighing these factors, the strongest statistical influences in the dataset are the large correlations linking trait anxiety and self‑esteem to CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81 and r ≈ −0.71, respectively). This participant’s values on those measures are favorable (low anxiety, high self‑esteem), which carries substantial weight in predicting lower depressive symptoms. Objective circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = 1.66) and low resting heart rate further reinforce a relatively low‑symptom profile. Countervailing evidence—disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6), somewhat short nightly sleep duration (median ≈6 h 38 m), modestly elevated perceived stress, and lower momentary happiness—indicates there are areas of vulnerability that could elevate CES‑D scores to some degree. However, these risk indicators have smaller correlations with CES‑D in the study sample or are only modest in magnitude compared with the large protective effects noted above.

Final statement regarding CES‑D relative to the sample mean
Taking the totality of evidence together, the balance of associations suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D score. This conclusion is provisional: it reflects a probabilistic inference from multiple correlates rather than a direct CES‑D measurement, and it should be interpreted with caution because cross‑sectional correlations do not establish causation. If a definitive assessment is required, direct administration of the CES‑D (or clinical interview) would be necessary to obtain the participant’s exact score."
28312,"Summary — overall impression
Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a mixed but ultimately convergent picture: several strong psychological signals point toward elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study sample, while behavioral and physiological markers show partial protective features. The strongest indicators of risk are elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66) and lower self-esteem (RSES = 35, Z = −0.45); both measures have large correlations with CES-D in this dataset (STAI r = 0.81; self‑esteem r = −0.71). Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05) and modestly elevated perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) add convergent evidence for greater symptom burden. Taken together — and weighing the relatively large CES-D correlations for anxiety and self-esteem — the combined pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.31). Given the mixture of risk and protective signals, the elevation is best characterized as a moderate increase (likely above the mean but not necessarily extreme; plausibly between the sample median and the 75th percentile).

Factors indicating relatively higher depressive symptoms
- High trait anxiety: The participant’s STAI score (48; Z = 0.66) is one of the clearest risk indicators. In this sample the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81), so elevated trait anxiety substantially increases the likelihood of higher depressive symptoms.  
- Lower self‑esteem: The Rosenberg score (35; Z = −0.45) is below the study mean and is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71); this is another robust correlate of greater depressive symptoms.  
- Subjective sleep problems and sleep variability: PSQI = 9 (Z = 1.05) indicates clinically relevant disturbed sleep; disturbed subjective sleep commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptoms. The participant also shows relatively large night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (SD = 123 minutes, Z = 0.51), and this variability has a positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.20), which is consistent with higher symptom burden.  
- Psychosocial stress and lower interpersonal trust: Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS Z = 0.38) and trust is somewhat lower than average (Trust Z = −0.46; trust correlated inversely with CES‑D r = −0.41), both of which align with increased depressive symptoms.  
- Behavioral inactivity: Low frequency of exercise and sports (e.g., exercising alone 1–2×/month; sports “not at all”) is consistent with behavioral patterns often associated with higher depressive symptoms, although in this dataset exercise-frequency correlations with CES‑D are small.

Factors indicating relatively lower depressive symptoms (protective or inconsistent)
- Objective sleep duration and some circadian robustness: Median wearable sleep duration is 7 h 35 m (Z = 0.51), which is within a generally healthy range and tends not to support a severe depressive profile; interdaily stability (Z = 0.33) and strong amplitude (amplitude Z = 1.54) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 0.90) indicate a relatively regular, high-amplitude heart‑rate circadian rhythm. Several circadian metrics (e.g., amplitude, interdaily stability, low intradaily variability) are generally associated with better mood regulation or at least not strongly associated with higher CES‑D in this sample (weak correlations, many near zero).  
- Self-reported current happiness and academic functioning: The participant endorses a moderate positive happiness rating (Happy = 4, Z = 0.55; happy correlates moderately negative with CES‑D r = −0.46), and academic performance is strong (GPAs in the high range). These factors can buffer against functional impairment and may attenuate the severity of depressive symptoms.  
- Low substance/drug use: No recreational or non‑prescribed drug use and only moderate alcohol consumption (1–2×/week) are features that do not suggest heavy substance-related risk for depressive symptoms in this dataset.

Physiological arousal, circadian patterning, and sleep timing
Wearable heart‑rate metrics show a higher-than-average MESOR (mean HR ≈ 83.4 bpm, Z = 1.30) and an evening peak in aggregated heart‑rate deviation (largest hourly deviation at 5–6 pm, +21.85; Z = 1.65). Resting heart rate is modestly elevated (61.7 bpm, Z = 0.42). These signals indicate greater mean cardiovascular tone and a pronounced diurnal rise in the late afternoon/early evening. Correlations of these specific heart‑rate features with CES‑D are small in this sample (r values close to zero to ~0.2), so while the physiological pattern can be interpreted as elevated arousal and strong circadian amplitude, they provide only modest direct evidence for higher depressive symptoms. Sleep timing is relatively late on average (median sleep onset ~01:23) and night‑to‑night duration variability is elevated; late bedtimes plus perceived poor sleep quality may interact with mood vulnerability, even when objective total sleep time is adequate.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the sample distribution
Weighing the evidence, the participant’s profile shows several strong psychological risk indicators for depressive symptoms (notably elevated trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem) combined with subjective sleep disturbance and modest psychosocial stress. Physiological circadian indicators are mixed — overall circadian structure appears robust (which is relatively protective), but mean cardiovascular tone and evening arousal are higher than average and sleep timing is late with variable duration. Considering the very large STAI–CES‑D and self‑esteem–CES‑D correlations in this dataset, the balance of evidence favors an inference that the participant’s depressive symptom level is above the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31). Given the presence of protective factors (adequate total sleep time, regular circadian amplitude, academic success, and moderate happiness), the elevation is best described as moderate rather than extreme — plausibly above the mean and closer to the upper half of the sample (between the median and the 75th percentile) rather than in the most severe range.

Limitations
This inference is probabilistic and based on correlational relationships and proxy indicators rather than a directly reported CES‑D score for this participant. Wearable aggregates are temporally pooled and do not reflect day‑by‑day dynamics; correlations are sample-level associations and do not establish causation. Clinical interpretation should rely on direct symptom measures and, if appropriate, a structured clinical assessment."
56805,"Summary: The multimodal profile shows a mix of strong psychological self-report indicators consistent with relatively low depressive symptom burden alongside a few behavioral and wearable-derived markers that could be interpreted as risk factors. The self-report pattern (very low trait anxiety, elevated self-esteem, high current happiness, good perceived sleep quality, high health satisfaction, frequent group exercise, and minimal substance use) forms the most robust body of evidence in favor of a lower CES-D score. Objective physiology and behavior from the wearable (short nocturnal sleep duration, later sleep timing, and somewhat reduced circadian stability) provide countervailing signals that warrant attention but are smaller in magnitude and less consistently related to CES-D in this dataset.

Evidence pointing toward relatively low CES-D score: Several self-report measures that are strongly correlated with depressive symptoms in the study sample point to lower depression risk in this participant. Trait anxiety (STAI) is very low (Z = -2.11) and has a large positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81); low anxiety therefore strongly predicts lower CES-D here. Self-esteem is high (Z = 1.66) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), again favoring lower symptom levels. Current self-reported happiness is elevated (Z = 1.64; r with CES-D = -0.46), and health satisfaction is high (Z = 2.05; r = -0.39). The participant reports minimal substance use and frequent social/physical activity (exercise with others and sports three+ times/week, positive Z-scores), behaviors that are typically associated with lower depressive symptoms in this sample (exercise correlations to CES-D are modestly negative). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI score indicating “good sleep,” Z = -1.26) also aligns with lower depressive symptom risk.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher CES-D or increased risk: Objective wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics present some possible risk signals. Median nightly sleep duration is short (5 h 33 min; Z = -2.02), and the participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 1:20 AM), which in other work is sometimes associated with mood vulnerability. Circadian regularity metrics show reduced interdaily stability (value 0.30, Z = -0.9) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = -0.78), indicating less consistent day-to-day heart rate rhythms. Although the direct correlations between these specific wearable measures and CES-D in the sample are small or near zero, reduced circadian regularity and insufficient nocturnal sleep are mechanistically relevant risk factors for mood disturbance and therefore temper the otherwise protective self-report profile. It is also notable that objective and subjective sleep indices are somewhat discordant here (objectively short nocturnal sleep but subjectively “good” sleep), which can reflect either efficient sleep consolidation or underestimation of sleep needs; this discordance itself can be meaningful for monitoring.

Physiological and hourly heart-rate patterns: The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are low relative to the sample (resting HR = 44.2 bpm, mesor = 64.45; Z-scores -1.66 and -1.3), which commonly reflect good cardiovascular fitness and are weakly associated in this dataset with lower CES-D (resting HR correlation with CES-D r = 0.19 — i.e., higher RHR modestly associated with higher depression). The hourly aggregate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough and a clear daytime rise (largest positive deviations in mid-morning to mid-afternoon), with an acrophase around 3:10 PM, and an amplitude near the sample mean. These phase and amplitude features indicate a preserved diurnal pattern of cardiovascular activation but with somewhat reduced overall circadian stability; because correlations between these specific rhythm measures and CES-D are small, they are less determinative than the strong self-report signals.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.34). This judgement rests primarily on multiple, strongly weighted self-report indicators that correlate closely with CES-D in the sample (very low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness, good subjective sleep, low substance use, and active social/exercise engagement). Countervailing objective signals (short objectively measured sleep duration, late sleep timing, and reduced interdaily stability) represent plausible risk factors that do not, in this dataset, carry the same predictive weight as the self-report measures but merit monitoring, especially if sleep timing or duration worsen over time.

Caveats and recommendations: The wearable-derived short sleep duration and reduced circadian stability warrant follow-up because persistent short sleep and irregular rhythms can precede increases in mood symptoms even when self-report is currently favorable. Given the strong inverse indicators (low anxiety, high self-esteem, high happiness), immediate concern for elevated depressive symptomatology is low, but periodic reassessment of sleep duration/timing and mood symptoms is advisable. If clinical monitoring is indicated, emphasize tracking objective sleep duration, sleep timing variability, and subjective mood/anxiety changes over time rather than relying on any single metric."
26800,"Overview: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of signals relevant to depressive symptoms. Objective wearable measures show a generally regular sleep duration and a low resting heart rate with reduced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability; self-report measures show relatively high self-esteem and generally good subjective sleep quality alongside modest current happiness and a moderate trait-anxiety score. Several variables with moderate-to-strong correlations with CES‑D point in different directions, so the overall picture is mixed and suggests symptom levels near the study population average rather than clearly extreme in either direction.

Features that tend to indicate relatively higher depressive symptoms: trait anxiety (STAI = 40) is one of the strongest risk-relevant self-reports in this dataset because STAI correlates highly with CES‑D in the study (r = 0.81); even though the participant’s STAI z-score is near the sample mean (z ≈ −0.13), elevated anxiety proneness is a robust predictor of higher depressive symptoms. Lower momentary happiness (self-rated “Happy” = 3.0, z ≈ −0.53; correlation with CES‑D ≈ −0.46) and modest perceived stress also point toward some affective strain. Behaviorally, minimal exercise (especially exercising with others = “Not at all,” z ≈ −1.58) is relevant because lower physical activity and low social exercise frequency have small-to-moderate associations with higher CES‑D scores in this sample. Circadian structure is also disrupted relative to the cohort: interdaily stability (value = 0.3, z ≈ −0.9) and amplitude (8.0, z ≈ −0.9) are both lower than the sample average; attenuated amplitude and weaker day-to-day regularity in heart rate rhythms have been linked to greater depressive symptoms in many studies and represent a physiological pattern that could support higher CES‑D.

Features that tend to indicate relatively lower depressive symptoms: the participant’s self‑esteem stands out as a protective factor (Rosenberg score z ≈ +0.96) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in the study data (r ≈ −0.71). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, z ≈ −0.8, classified as “Good Sleep”) and median nightly sleep duration of ~7 h 14 min (z ≈ +0.06) are consistent with adequate restorative sleep and generally do not point toward elevated depressive symptomatology; sleep stability is reasonable and naps are rare. Objective physiology is also evidence of lower arousal: resting heart rate is relatively low (49.4 bpm, z ≈ −1.04), and mesor is below the sample mean (z ≈ −0.91); because higher resting heart rate and higher mesor are positively associated with CES‑D in this cohort (small positive correlations), the participant’s low cardiovascular baseline is consistent with lower CES‑D. Academic performance (GPA consistently high) and modest engagement in social activities (socializing 1–2 hours, near the sample mean) are additional contextual elements that tend to be protective or neutral with respect to depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and caveats: several strong indicators pull in opposite directions. High self‑esteem and objectively adequate sleep and low resting heart rate argue for lower depressive symptom burden. By contrast, trait anxiety, lower self-reported happiness, low exercise (particularly with others), and reduced circadian amplitude/interdaily stability provide credible evidence for elevated symptoms or vulnerability. Many of the wearable circadian metrics show only small correlations with CES‑D in this sample, so their contribution should be considered supportive rather than definitive. The pattern of a late median sleep start time (≈ 1:28 AM) combined with a normal overall sleep duration suggests a delayed schedule rather than an insomnia-like sleep restriction; timing-related factors can interact with mood but here are not strongly predictive by themselves.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: weighing protective (notably high self‑esteem, good subjective sleep, low resting heart rate) and risk-related signals (trait anxiety, lower happiness, low exercise, reduced circadian amplitude), the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is near the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.32, SD = 9.62). The data do not point to a clear, large departure above or below the cohort mean; instead they indicate a mixed profile with some protective strengths and some vulnerability markers that would be consistent with a CES‑D score close to the sample average. If clinical or research decisions depend on a more precise estimate, direct measurement of the participant’s CES‑D score (if not already obtained) or longitudinal symptom tracking would be necessary to resolve the current ambiguity."
47142,"Summary: The multimodal record presents a mixed profile with both risk-related and protective features for depressive symptoms. Self-report measures show moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; classification: ""anxious"", Z = 0.17) and somewhat lower self-esteem (RSES = 35, Z = −0.45), along with reduced momentary happiness (self-rated ""Happy"" = 3, Z = −0.53) and lower health satisfaction (Z = −0.95). Wearable-derived circadian and sleep metrics show a generally regular, well-structured 24‑hour pattern (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high 24‑hour autocorrelation) alongside a relatively late and slightly short sleep schedule (median sleep start ~01:39 AM; median sleep duration 6 h 32 min, Z = −0.81). Below I outline findings that point toward higher versus lower depressive symptom burden and then give a holistic comparison to the study population.

Features consistent with relatively higher depressive symptomatology: Several psychological and behavioral markers align with increased depressive symptom risk. Trait anxiety is elevated and correlates strongly with CES‑D in the sample (STAI–CES‑D correlation = 0.81); the participant’s STAI score (43) therefore provides notable evidence of internalizing distress that often co-occurs with depressive symptoms. Lower self‑esteem (RSES Z = −0.45) is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ −0.71), so the participant’s below‑average self‑esteem is another important risk signal. Subjective affect is muted (lower happiness rating, Z = −0.53), and perceived stress is nontrivial (PSS = 20), both of which are typically associated with greater depressive symptoms. Behavioral features that can index risk include relatively late bedtimes (median sleep start near 1:40 AM) and a shorter-than-average nocturnal sleep duration (median ~6.5 hours, Z = −0.81), plus an elevated frequency of naps (mean daily naps 0.3, Z = 2.66; naps here correlate positively with CES‑D in the sample). Reduced socializing (social time Z = −1.41) and little to no group-based exercise are also behavioral patterns that commonly accompany higher depressive symptom levels.

Features consistent with relatively lower depressive symptomatology: Several objective and behavioral indicators point away from substantial depressive symptom burden. Circadian rhythm structure derived from heart rate is robust: interdaily stability is high (value 0.54, Z = 1.08) and intradaily variability is low (value 0.36, Z = −1.31), with strong autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.48). Those features indicate a stable, consolidated daily rhythm—a profile generally associated with lower mood disturbance or better physiological regulation. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, Z = −1.26), suggesting the participant does not report major sleep problems despite a late sleep timing. Wearable nightly heart‑rate profiles show a pronounced nocturnal fall from mesor (large negative deviations overnight) and clear daytime elevations, indicating preserved sleep‑wake cardiac modulation. The participant reports minimal substance use and maintains strong academic performance (GPA range high), both of which are protective relative to typical depression risk markers. Exercise does occur (exercising alone 1–2×/week) and sedentary recreational time is low; these behaviors can support well-being.

Physiological profile and circadian timing: The participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are modestly elevated relative to the study sample (resting HR = 65.1 bpm, Z = 0.83; mesor Z = 1.32), and in this cohort both measures show small positive correlations with CES‑D (≈0.19). Nighttime heart‑rate deviations are appropriately lower than daytime values (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM), indicating preserved nocturnal autonomic downshift. The cosinor acrophase around early evening (≈5:06 PM) and a mid‑sized amplitude suggest a daytime peak in cardiovascular activation; the circadian regularity measures (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, strong 24‑h autocorrelation) point to a well‑entrained rhythm, which is typically a favorable sign for mood regulation even when sleep timing is relatively late.

Holistic assessment relative to the study population mean CES‑D: Considering the balance of evidence, the profile contains several signals that elevate the likelihood of above‑average depressive symptoms (notably elevated trait anxiety, reduced self‑esteem, lower reported happiness, shorter/late sleep, frequent napping, reduced socializing), but also a number of countervailing protective signs (good subjective sleep quality, strong circadian regularity, limited substance use, good academic functioning). Given the relatively strong sample-level associations of anxiety and self‑esteem with CES‑D and the participant’s moderately elevated anxiety and modestly lower self‑esteem, the overall pattern is most consistent with a depressive symptom level at or slightly above the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.29). In other words: the participant’s profile suggests CES‑D near to, and plausibly a bit above, the population mean rather than clearly far below or far above it.

Imprecision and caveats: This synthesis is probabilistic and based on cross‑sectional associations and group correlations; wearable aggregates do not provide day‑to‑day causal sequencing. Some protective and risk indicators offset one another, so the inferred placement near or slightly above the sample mean should be treated as an informed estimate rather than a definitive score. If clinical decision‑making is intended, direct CES‑D measurement and brief clinical follow‑up would improve accuracy."
60396,"Summary impression
The available self-report and wearable data present a mixed but coherent pattern: several robust indicators point away from a high level of depressive symptoms (regular sleep duration, consolidated circadian physiology, social exercise, and positive self-reports of happiness/trust/health), while a few psychologically salient measures (trait anxiety and below-average self‑esteem, together with some subjective sleep disturbance and reduced casual socializing/hobby engagement) point toward elevated depressive symptom risk. On balance, the profile is most consistent with an overall depressive symptom level near the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.32), rather than clearly above or well below it.

Evidence favoring relatively higher CES‑D symptoms
- Trait anxiety (STAI = 42, Z ≈ 0.07) is a notable risk indicator: the STAI–trait score in this dataset shows a strong positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81). Even though this individual’s score is near the study mean rather than extreme, the strong predictive relationship between anxiety and depressive symptoms means this factor increases the likelihood of elevated CES‑D scores.  
- Lower-than-average self‑esteem (RSES = 33, Z = −0.73) is also important because self‑esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71). The participant’s self‑esteem is below the sample mean and therefore constitutes a meaningful vulnerability for higher depressive symptoms.  
- Subjective sleep difficulties (PSQI = 6; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) add risk: although objective sleep duration is adequate, the participant reports clinically relevant sleep disturbance, and poor subjective sleep commonly associates with higher depressive symptoms.  
- Reduced engagement in some casual social/recreational activities (e.g., “do not” listen to music or read; relatively low socializing with friends, Z ≈ −0.62) and modestly elevated video‑game use may reflect lower hedonic or social activity, which is commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms.

Evidence favoring relatively lower CES‑D symptoms
- Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics indicate robust daily structure and low physiological arousal typical of lower depressive symptomatology: high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.57), low intradaily variability (IV Z = −1.45), and reasonably stable interdaily stability (IS Z ≈ −0.24). These non‑parametric rhythm metrics suggest well‑consolidated activity/physiology across days, which is generally protective against depressive symptoms.  
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity are favorable: median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 23 min (Z = 0.26) with relatively low night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD Z = −0.69) and low mean daily napping (Z ≈ −0.08). Adequate and consistent sleep duration is associated with lower CES‑D scores in this sample.  
- Low resting heart rate and a somewhat lower mesor (resting HR = 49.4 bpm, mesor ≈ 65.8; both Z ≈ −1.0 to −1.1) suggest lower baseline physiological arousal; in this sample higher resting HR correlates modestly with higher CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), so the participant’s low values are relatively protective. Evening peaks in heart‑rate deviation (notably 7–9 pm) are pronounced but show small negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample, which is consistent with preserved evening activity and engagement rather than psychomotor slowing.  
- Social/behavioral and well‑being self‑reports are protective: frequent exercise with others (three times/week or more; Z = 1.23) has a small-to-moderate negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.23). Higher current happiness (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55; r = −0.46), higher interpersonal trust (Z = 1.15; r = −0.41), and greater satisfaction with physical health (Z = 0.88; r = −0.39) are all associated in this dataset with lower CES‑D scores and therefore argue against a substantially elevated depressive symptom level.

Holistic interpretation and relative comparison to the study sample
Two of the strongest statistical predictors of CES‑D in the study—trait anxiety (r = 0.81) and self‑esteem (r = −0.71)—pull in the direction of increased depressive symptoms for this participant, but their absolute values are not extreme (STAI near the sample mean; RSES modestly below mean). Several complementary protective signals—stable circadian physiology (high 24‑h autocorrelation and low IV), adequate and regular sleep duration, low resting HR, frequent group exercise, and relatively high happiness/trust/health satisfaction—argue for lower depressive symptom burden. Considering both the magnitudes of the person’s scores and the strength of their correlations with CES‑D, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s depressive symptomatology is near the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.32), rather than strongly above it. If anything, the physiological and social‑behavioral indicators slightly bias the inference toward modestly lower-than-average symptoms, but not decisively so.

Clinical and monitoring implications (interpretive, not diagnostic)
- The combination of elevated trait anxiety and below‑average self‑esteem merits attention because these two factors are strongly predictive of depressive symptoms in this sample; targeted interventions or monitoring for anxiety and self‑concept could meaningfully affect CES‑D outcomes.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance despite objectively adequate duration—and a late median sleep onset (≈ 01:46 AM)—suggests sleep timing or sleep quality issues that may be amenable to behavioral change and could improve mood and daytime functioning.  
- Protective factors (regular circadian rhythms, group exercise, social trust/happiness, and good health satisfaction) are assets to preserve and could be leveraged in preventive or supportive strategies.

This analysis synthesizes the multimodal data available and does not constitute a diagnostic statement. It is based on correlational relationships observed in the study sample and on the participant’s relative standing (Z‑scores) on key measures."
92412,"Summary: Across survey self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a profile with multiple indicators that are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden and few strong indicators of elevated depressive symptoms. Self-report indices (high self-esteem, elevated current happiness, low perceived stress, good subjective sleep quality) and health behaviors (regular exercise, no substance use, strong academic performance) strongly point away from elevated CES-D scores. Wearable data show generally regular sleep duration (median ~7 h 48 m), low night-to-night variability, a relatively low resting heart rate (53 bpm) and a pronounced day–night heart rate amplitude; these physiological signs are consistent with preserved circadian structure and cardiovascular fitness rather than a stress- or mood-related dysregulation pattern.

Factors indicating relatively lower depressive symptoms: The participant reports high self-esteem (Z = 0.82; the strongest single survey correlate in the dataset, r = −0.71 with CES-D), elevated self-rated happiness (Z = 1.64, r = −0.46), low perceived stress (PSS score 16, Z = −1.53), and a PSQI in the “good sleep” range (score = 4, Z = −1.26). Behavioral markers that typically protect against depressive symptoms—frequent exercise alone and with others (both Z > 1), absence of alcohol or recreational drug use, and consistently high academic performance (multiple 4.0 GPAs)—add further weight toward a lower CES-D estimate. Wearable-derived circadian metrics (moderate interdaily stability, higher amplitude, low mesor and low resting heart rate) and median sleep duration above the sample mean (7 h 48 m, Z = 0.76) also align with lower symptom burden or resilience.

Factors that could be interpreted as modest risk indicators for elevated depressive symptoms: Social time reported is relatively low (socializing with friends 16–30 minutes, Z = −1.41), which can be relevant for mood but in this dataset has only a negligible correlation with CES-D (r ≈ −0.02). Sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 00:54) even though duration and variability are acceptable; later sleep timing can, in some individuals, relate to mood vulnerability. A higher intradaily variability in the heart-rate circadian signal (IV Z = 0.81) can reflect greater within-day fragmentation of activity/rest, but correlations between IV and CES-D here are very small (r ≈ −0.05). Several hourly heart-rate deviations during the early-morning and small positive correlations between some nocturnal heart-rate deviations and CES-D (r up to ~0.16) are present but weak; these do not provide strong evidence of physiologic arousal patterns tied to depressive symptomatology in this case.

Interpretation of ambulatory physiology and activity timing: The participant’s wearable profile shows a robust day–night amplitude and a low mesor/low resting heart rate, which are consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness and a well-entrained circadian rhythm. A particularly large aggregate elevation in heart rate in the early evening (around 5–6 pm; Z ≈ 4.2) indicates consistent evening activity or exercise—this is plausibly protective for mood and aligns with the self-reported frequent exercise. Nighttime heart-rate reductions are marked and stable. Overall, the heart-rate-derived circadian metrics do not show the flattened amplitude, blunted rhythm, or substantially elevated resting physiology that often accompany higher depressive symptom scores in population studies.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Taking the full multimodal profile into account, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study sample mean CES-D score of 13.34. Protective self-report measures (especially high self-esteem and happiness), low stress, good sleep quality and duration, frequent exercise, absence of substance use, and physiological indicators of preserved circadian amplitude collectively point toward lower-than-average depressive symptoms. Remaining, but comparatively minor, considerations (later sleep timing, reduced social time, modest intraday variability) warrant routine monitoring but do not, in this dataset, outweigh the protective signals. Because wearable–CES-D correlations in this sample are generally small, conclusions about symptom level are driven principally by the strong self-report indicators; if a more definitive assessment is required, a direct CES-D score or clinical assessment would reduce uncertainty."
92038,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant presents a mixed profile in which multiple strong self-report protective signals (high self-esteem, high current happiness, low trait anxiety and intact daytime functioning) coexist with measurable sleep/circadian irregularities and within-day autonomic fragmentation that are plausibly linked to elevated depressive symptoms. On net, the balance of evidence suggests depressive symptom burden inferred from these multimodal indicators is likely below the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.34), though not uniformly low across all risk domains.

Features that point toward relatively higher depressive symptomatology: Subjective sleep quality is classified as “disturbed” on the PSQI (score = 6), and wearable-derived sleep shows substantial variability in timing and duration (sleep duration SD = 145 minutes, Z = 1.0; sleep start time SD = 114 minutes, Z = 0.69). Both sleep irregularity measures have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample and are established risk factors for mood disturbance. Circadian / activity fragmentation is also notable: intradaily variability is elevated (IV = 0.72, Z = 1.23), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.22, Z = -0.87), indicating less consistent day-to-day heart-rate rhythmicity. Physiological data show some nocturnal/evening signs of relative hyperarousal — a modest positive deviation around midnight (12–1 am value = +5.4, Z = 1.03) combined with a pronounced late-afternoon peak in heart-rate deviation (4–5 pm value = +25.31, Z = 2.45) — patterns that can reflect dysregulated arousal and a later circadian phase, both of which are associated with greater depressive symptoms in some samples. These objective sleep/circadian findings, together with PSQI-defined disturbed sleep, constitute the primary risk-related evidence.

Features that point toward relatively lower depressive symptomatology: Several robust self-report indicators that correlate strongly with lower CES-D are present. The participant reports high self-esteem (RSES Z = +1.66; sample correlation with CES-D = -0.71) and relatively high current happiness (Z = +1.64; correlation with CES-D = -0.46), both of which are substantial protective signals. Trait anxiety is low (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02), and perceived stress is not elevated (PSS Z = -0.44). The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times/week or more; exercise Z-scores > +1.0), minimal recreational drug use, moderate socializing (1–2 hours/day), and good satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = +1.3) — behavioral and attitudinal factors that tend to associate with lower depressive symptoms. Wearable-derived circadian amplitude is relatively large (amplitude Z = +0.99), and overall median nightly sleep duration is adequate (median = 7 h 36 min, Z = +0.52), which are features typically linked to more favorable mood outcomes. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56), consistent with cardiorespiratory fitness and generally healthier profiles.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample mean: Integrating the weighted evidence, the participant’s profile leans toward lower depressive symptom levels relative to the study population mean CES-D of 13.34. This conclusion is primarily driven by strong protective self-report indicators (high self-esteem, high current happiness, low anxiety, regular exercise and health satisfaction), adequate median sleep duration, and a relatively pronounced circadian amplitude. However, objective sleep timing irregularity and intraday fragmentation are notable countervailing signals that could elevate depressive symptoms over time or under stress. Thus, while the participant’s overall multimodal pattern suggests CES-D values below the population mean, there are targeted domains (sleep regularity and circadian stability) that warrant attention as potential contributors to future symptom increases.

Data interpretation caveats: Correlations reported in the dataset are associative and do not indicate causation; wearable hourly heart-rate deviations are aggregated across days and therefore do not index day-to-day symptom co-variation. The strongest predictive pieces here are the large-magnitude self-report associations (e.g., self-esteem) and the objectively measured high sleep/circadian variability; both should be considered in context and, if clinical monitoring is intended, followed up with targeted sleep/circadian assessment or intervention."
86440,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile reflects a mix of objective behavioral/physiological regularity and largely protective self-report indicators, with a few signals that could be consistent with elevated depressive symptoms. Self-report measures (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated happiness, and relatively low perceived stress) and several wearable-derived metrics (low resting heart rate, normal median sleep duration, relatively regular sleep timing) point toward lower depressive symptomatology than the study sample average. Conversely, a PSQI score in the “disturbed sleep” range and a modestly reduced circadian amplitude on heart-rate measures are the clearest features that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms. Taking all sources together, the pattern is more consistent with a CES-D level below the study population mean (population mean CES-D = 13.31), though not entirely free of risk signals.

Self-report indicators that argue for lower depressive symptoms: Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI = 38, z ≈ -0.33), self-esteem is high (RSES = 37, z ≈ -0.17) and shows a strong negative association with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), and self-rated happiness is above average (z ≈ 0.55). Perceived stress is lower than the cohort average (PSS z ≈ -0.71), and interpersonal trust is somewhat elevated (z ≈ 0.5), both of which — given their sample correlations with CES-D (stress r ≈ 0.28; trust r ≈ -0.41) — point toward lower depressive symptomatology. Low substance use, moderate sports participation (1–2×/week, z ≈ 0.91), and relatively high academic performance (GPAs ~3.7–3.75) further align with protective behavioral and functional indicators.

Self-report and behavioral indicators that argue for higher depressive symptoms: The participant’s PSQI score (7.0; classified as “Disturbed Sleep,” z ≈ 0.13) signals subjective sleep difficulties, which often co-occur with elevated depressive symptoms. Although many objective sleep metrics are near average, the subjective report of poor sleep is a meaningful risk indicator because subjective sleep complaints predict affective symptom burden beyond duration alone. Exercise frequency alone is low (exercising alone less than 1–2×/month, z ≈ -1.18), which could reduce opportunities for mood-regulating activity, though this is partially offset by weekly sports participation. These are the primary self-report/behavioral signals that temper the otherwise protective pattern.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac measures: The participant shows a low resting heart rate (51 bpm, z ≈ -0.85) and a low heart-rate MESOR (64.67, z ≈ -1.27), both of which — given the small positive sample correlation between MESOR/RHR and CES-D — suggest lower rather than higher depressive symptom risk. Circadian regularity metrics are broadly unremarkable: interdaily stability is slightly below mean (0.39, z ≈ -0.16) and intradaily variability is near the cohort mean (0.56, z ≈ 0.10), with sample correlations to CES-D that are low in magnitude. The amplitude of the cosinor fit is somewhat reduced (8.91, z ≈ -0.60); lower amplitude of heart-rate rhythms has been associated in some research with poorer mood states, and here the amplitude’s modest negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.10) is small but consistent with that concern. Overall, the wearable circadian signal points to generally intact diurnal structure with a slightly blunted amplitude that warrants attention but is not a dominant risk factor.

Hourly heart-rate profile and sleep timing: The aggregated hourly deviations show a typical nocturnal trough and daytime elevations (largest relative elevation in mid-afternoon), consistent with a coherent diurnal pattern rather than dysregulated 24-hour physiology. Median sleep duration (7 h 1 min, z ≈ -0.21) and low mean daily nap frequency (0.0, z ≈ -0.86) indicate adequate objective sleep quantity; sleep start time is relatively late (median ≈ 00:50) but reasonably consistent (start-time SD ≈ 51 minutes, z ≈ -0.70). Notably, the participant reports disturbed sleep subjectively (PSQI > 5) despite normal objective duration, which can reflect fragmented sleep quality or sleep-related distress that is not captured by duration alone — a feature often linked to mood symptoms.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: On balance, the convergent evidence from trait measures (low anxiety, high self-esteem, higher happiness), behavioral factors (low substance use, weekly sports), and physiology (low resting heart rate, preserved diurnal heart-rate pattern, adequate objective sleep duration) favors an inferred CES-D level that is below the study population mean (13.31). The main countervailing signals are subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and a modestly reduced circadian amplitude; these could contribute to elevated symptoms for some individuals but, in this participant, appear secondary to multiple protective indicators. Therefore, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s depressive-symptom burden is likely below the cohort mean, while noting that targeted assessment of sleep quality and mood-related sleep complaints would be appropriate given the subjective sleep disturbance."
29792,"Summary paragraph — overall impression
Across the multimodal dataset the participant shows a mixture of risk and protective indicators for depressive symptoms. Prominent risk-related signals include elevated trait anxiety, subjectively disturbed sleep and a late sleep schedule, and signs of elevated evening physiological activation. Prominent protective signals include very high self‑esteem, relatively high momentary happiness and interpersonal trust, frequent group-based exercise and a low resting heart rate. Balancing these features, the pattern most consistently supports an overall depressive-symptom level near the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.31), with modest evidence that symptoms could be slightly above the mean in a probabilistic sense. This judgment weighs the strong predictive association of trait anxiety and disturbed sleep with CES‑D against equally strong inverse associations for self‑esteem and current positive affect; given those countervailing influences the most defensible categorical assessment from the available data is “near the mean,” perhaps mildly elevated but not clearly extreme.

Factors that point toward relatively higher CES‑D symptoms
Several measures point toward an increased likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) is moderately above the sample mean and the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most potent single risk indicators. Sleep reports also raise concern: the PSQI score is 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), and wearable-derived sleep shows a median nightly duration of 6 h 11 min (Z = –1.25), indicating short sleep relative to the sample; short, disturbed, or insufficient sleep is commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms. The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (about 04:31), which is consistent with delayed sleep timing and can be associated with mood symptoms. Wearable-derived physiology shows pronounced evening heart‑rate elevations (e.g., 7–8 pm deviation = 23.6, Z = 2.12), indicating higher evening physiological arousal that has been linked to poorer mood regulation in some studies. Finally, the 24‑hour autocorrelation of heart rate is low (0.19, Z = –1.12), suggesting reduced day‑to‑day regularity of the heart‑rate rhythm; while its correlation with CES‑D in this sample is small (r = 0.03), reduced circadian regularity can represent a vulnerability for mood disturbance.

Factors that point toward relatively lower CES‑D symptoms
Multiple robust protective indicators appear in the data. The participant’s Rosenberg self‑esteem score is at the top of the scale (40, Z = 0.26) and self‑esteem shows a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = –0.71), making this a highly relevant resilience factor. Current self‑reported happiness is moderately elevated (4.0, Z = 0.55; correlation with CES‑D r = –0.46), and interpersonal trust is relatively high (3.67, Z = 0.83; r = –0.41), both of which are associated with lower depressive symptoms. Behavioral engagement that is protective includes frequent exercise with others (three times a week or more, Z = 1.23) and regular socializing (1–2 hours per day), which in this dataset correlate negatively with CES‑D; these social and activity factors commonly buffer against depressive symptoms. Physiologically, resting heart rate is low (52 bpm, Z = –0.73), which in this sample is associated with a small positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.19) but clinically often reflects better cardiovascular fitness and lower baseline autonomic arousal — features that can be protective. The interdaily stability of the heart‑rate rhythm is moderately positive (0.46, Z = 0.42), indicating reasonably regular day‑to‑day structure in activity, a pattern generally associated with better mood.

Integrated synthesis and comparison to the study population mean
When the relative strengths of these signals are considered together, the picture is mixed. The single strongest statistical predictor available here is trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES‑D), which argues for elevated depressive symptoms; however, this is countervailed by very high self‑esteem and moderately high momentary happiness and social behavior, each of which is strongly negatively associated with CES‑D. Sleep disturbance and late sleep timing provide an additional, clinically meaningful risk that pushes the balance slightly toward elevated symptoms. Given these countervailing, reasonably well‑measured influences, the best-supported inference is that the participant’s depressive symptom level would most likely fall near the study sample mean (13.31). There is modest reason to believe symptoms could be slightly above the population mean because of the combination of elevated trait anxiety and disturbed/short late sleep, but the strong protective indicators (self‑esteem, happiness, social exercise) reduce the probability of a substantially higher CES‑D score.

Limitations and uncertainty
This interpretation is probabilistic and correlational. Several of the most predictive measures (e.g., STAI, RSES) have strong sample correlations with CES‑D and therefore heavily influence the inference, but these are not diagnostic. Some wearable-derived correlations with CES‑D are small, so physiological features should be treated as supplementary. The absence of the participant’s actual CES‑D score prevents a direct validation of the inference; conclusions are therefore best framed as relative risk compared to the study sample rather than an individual diagnosis."
14737,"Elevated indicators consistent with higher depressive symptoms are present in this participant’s profile. Trait anxiety (STAI = 45; Z = 0.37) is meaningfully elevated and has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r = 0.81), identifying anxiety proneness as a major risk signal. Lower self-esteem (RSES = 34; Z = -0.59) is also notable and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), which similarly points toward greater depressive symptom burden. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) and objective sleep patterns that are short and irregular—median nightly sleep 6 hr 3 min (Z = -1.41), high standard deviation of sleep duration (133 min; Z = 0.74), and very late median sleep start time (01:47) with high variability (start time SD Z = 1.14)—are additional risk-related features, particularly because variability in sleep timing and duration shows small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D (sleep-duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep-start SD r ≈ 0.22). Behavioral markers of reduced social and physical engagement (very little exercise with others, little socializing; socializing Z = -1.41) and lower interpersonal trust (Trust Z = -0.78; trust–CES-D r = -0.41) further align with patterns commonly seen with higher depressive symptoms.

Several features point in the opposite direction and are relatively protective or inconsistent with high depressive symptomatology. Self-reported current happiness is above average (Happy = 4.0; Z = 0.55) and this item has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.46). Perceived stress score is lower than the sample mean (PSS = 20; Z = -0.44), which attenuates the simple expectation of high depressive symptoms. Objective physiology provides mixed evidence: resting heart rate is lower than average (RHR = 54.2 bpm; Z = -0.47) and mesor is near the sample mean (mesor = 74.34; Z = 0.05), and some circadian parameters (interdaily stability Z = 0.33, amplitude Z = 0.53) indicate a degree of daily structure rather than gross rhythm disruption. Low engagement in substance use (alcohol and recreational drugs reported “not at all”) and relatively high academic performance (GPAs reported) are additional behavioral factors that are not typical of high depressive symptom burden in this sample.

Physiological and circadian heart-rate features provide nuanced context. Non-parametric rhythm metrics show modestly increased intradaily variability (IV = 0.64; Z = 0.67) and moderate interdaily stability (IS = 0.45; Z = 0.33). Increased IV and the observed high variability in sleep timing are generally associated with poorer mood regulation and have small positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset (IV correlation ≈ -0.06 to 0.2 depending on the metric, sleep variability correlations ~0.2), suggesting rhythm fragmentation that can co-occur with depressive symptoms. The cosinor-derived amplitude is slightly above average (amplitude Z = 0.53) and the acrophase at ~4:54 PM indicates a later-afternoon peak in aggregated heart-rate activity; notable large positive aggregated deviations in the early evening (6–7 pm deviation Z = 1.65) suggest pronounced evening physiological activation or activity bursts. Taken together, wearable physiology and sleep metrics point to a pattern of shortened, irregular sleep and modest circadian instability—features that tend to accompany higher CES-D scores—while overall daily structure (IS) and a relatively normal average heart rate temper that interpretation.

Holistic inference: weighing the evidence, the participant shows multiple strong indicators of elevated depressive symptom risk (notably trait anxiety and low self-esteem, disturbed and irregular sleep, reduced social engagement, and lower interpersonal trust) alongside several mitigating features (higher self-reported current happiness, lower perceived stress, low substance use, and near-average circadian mesor). Given the relative strength of the STAI–CES-D and self-esteem–CES-D correlations in the study (r ≈ 0.81 and r ≈ -0.71, respectively) and the participant’s elevations on those measures, the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.31). This conclusion is probabilistic rather than diagnostic: the profile suggests an elevated likelihood of CES-D scores above the sample mean but not necessarily an extreme score, and the presence of protective factors introduces uncertainty. Finally, these inferences are constrained by cross-sectional associations and correlational strengths reported in the sample; direct CES-D measurement and clinical assessment would be required for definitive determination."
28653,"Protective signals (features associated with lower CES‑D scores): Multiple self-report and wearable-derived metrics point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden. The participant reports high self‑esteem (RSES Z = +1.52) and above‑average momentary happiness (Current Happy Z = +1.64), both of which correlate negatively with CES‑D in the sample (self‑esteem r ≈ −0.71, happiness r ≈ −0.46). Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, Z = −1.26), and median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 4 min, Z = +1.10). Health satisfaction is high (Z = +1.63) and substance use is minimal. Behavioral markers of social and physical engagement (exercising with others three times/week or more, Z = +1.23) further align with lower depression risk (exercise with others r ≈ −0.23). Wearable circadian metrics also support a well‑regulated daily pattern: interdaily stability is elevated (0.58, Z = +1.41), intradaily variability is low (0.25, Z = −2.08), amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm is high (Z = +2.26), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (Z = +1.40). Lower resting heart rate (53 bpm, Z = −0.61) and pronounced daytime increases in heart rate (afternoon peaks, e.g., 3–4 pm deviation Z = +3.82) are consistent with regular wake‑activity physiology rather than blunted or flattened diurnal patterns sometimes seen with higher depressive symptoms.

Signals that could reflect elevated symptoms or create ambiguity: There are a few modest indicators and measurement caveats that temper the purely protective picture. Perceived stress is near the study mean (PSS = 21, Z ≈ −0.17) and thus does not provide a clear protective effect; some wearable–CES‑D correlations associated with nocturnal heart‑rate deviations are small but positive (e.g., 2–5 AM hourly deviations r ≈ +0.14 to +0.16), which could reflect subtle night‑time autonomic arousal for some individuals. Sleep start time is slightly after midnight (median 00:16) and sleep start variability is moderately elevated (SD ≈ 107 min, Z ≈ +0.53), which can be mixed in relation to mood depending on other context. Most of the correlations between individual physiological features and CES‑D in this dataset are small in magnitude, so these observations should be interpreted cautiously rather than taken as strong evidence of elevated symptomatology.

Circadian and physiological synthesis: The participant’s heart‑rate circadian profile is coherent and robust. A relatively large cosinor amplitude and a clear afternoon acrophase (≈ 3:42 PM) indicate strong day–night differentiation in cardiovascular arousal; interdaily stability and high 24‑hour autocorrelation indicate the participant maintains consistent daily timing. Low intradaily variability indicates limited fragmentation of activity/rest within days. Together these features are more commonly associated with lower depressive symptoms in the sample (amplitude and rhythm regularity show negative or small correlations with CES‑D), and they align with the participant’s self‑reported good sleep quality and regular sleep duration.

Overall comparative statement and uncertainty: Taking the totality of evidence into account — strong positive self‑report indices (self‑esteem, happiness, health satisfaction), minimal substance use, social exercise, objectively regular and robust circadian/actigraphy signatures, and generally favorable sleep metrics — the pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.33). This inference is probabilistic rather than deterministic: some small, mixed physiological signals and near‑average perceived stress introduce uncertainty, and the cross‑sectional and correlational nature of the indicators limits causal interpretation. In sum, the multimodal profile points toward relatively lower depressive symptomatology compared with the sample average, though ongoing monitoring of stress and nocturnal autonomic patterns would be prudent to detect any emerging changes."
95559,"Protective features likely associated with lower depressive symptoms
The participant shows several strong trait-level indicators that, in this sample, are associated with lower CES‑D scores. Trait anxiety (STAI = 29, Z = -1.22) is notably low; given the large positive STAI–CES‑D correlation reported for this study (r ≈ 0.81), this low anxiety score is a powerful predictor of fewer depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem is elevated relative to the study sample (Rosenberg score = 45, Z = 0.96) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), which also argues for lower depressive symptom burden. Other supporting features include a resting heart rate below the sample mean (54.1 bpm, Z = -0.48; RHR correlates positively with CES‑D in this sample), modest exercise frequency (1–2 times/week), and perceived stress that is slightly lower than average (PSS Z = -0.44). Together these trait and physiological signals point toward a lower-than-average CES‑D score.

Risk features likely associated with higher depressive symptoms
Despite those protective signals, several behavioral and sleep-related features are more characteristic of elevated depressive symptoms in this sample. Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7), which is a known correlate of depressive symptoms. The participant’s sleep schedule is markedly delayed (median sleep start ≈ 02:10 AM) and shows elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps = 0.25, Z = 2.07; naps correlate positively with CES‑D here). Alcohol use (beer three times a week, Z = 1.72) is above the sample mean; while its correlation with CES‑D in this dataset is small, heavier use can be behaviorally relevant. Self‑reported current happiness is below the sample mean (happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and correlates moderately with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.46). These features—disturbed and late sleep timing, elevated napping, reduced subjective happiness, and greater alcohol use—are consistent with elevated depressive symptom risk.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate patterns
Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a weak and blunted 24‑hour cardiac rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.17, Z = -1.98) and intradaily variability (0.29, Z = -1.80) are both well below the study mean, amplitude by cosinor is reduced (7.19, Z = -1.16), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -1.29). These values indicate relatively low day‑to‑day regularity and a flattened circadian heart‑rate profile. The aggregated hourly deviations show the expected overnight heart‑rate trough and an evening acrophase (peak ≈ 6:09 PM), but overall amplitude and stability are low. In this sample the direct correlations between these particular circadian metrics and CES‑D are modest to small; nonetheless, the combination of late sleep timing, irregular daily structure, and reduced circadian amplitude is behaviorally plausible as a contributor to elevated depressive symptoms for some individuals.

Overall integration and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the strongest statistical predictors in the dataset point toward lower depressive symptoms (notably the low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem, both of which have large correlations with CES‑D). Conversely, sleep disturbance, late and irregular sleep timing, elevated nap frequency, and some alcohol use point toward increased symptom risk, but these features have smaller correlations with CES‑D in this sample. On balance, the pattern of data is most consistent with an overall depressive symptom level at or slightly below the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.32). In other words, the participant’s profile suggests CES‑D scores that are likely near to, but somewhat lower than, the sample average rather than markedly above it.

Limitations and caution
This integrative conclusion weighs predictors according to their sample correlations and the participant’s relative z‑scores, but it is inferential: wearable circadian signals are aggregated across days and correlations do not establish causation. Direct CES‑D measurement would be necessary for definitive symptom classification. The evidence presented should be interpreted as probabilistic indicators rather than a clinical determination."
30152,"Indicators in this multimodal record that would be expected to align with higher depressive symptom burden center on subjective stress and sleep disturbance, limited positive affect, and some markers of reduced interpersonal trust. The participant reports elevated perceived stress (PSS = 24, Z = 0.65), and current happiness rating is relatively low (3.0, Z = -0.53); both of these survey items have nontrivial associations with CES-D in the sample (stress correlation 0.28; happiness correlation -0.46), suggesting these features would contribute to higher CES-D scores. Sleep-related self-report (PSQI = 7, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”, Z = 0.13) and objective sleep timing also point toward risk: median sleep onset is very late (02:28 AM) and sleep start time variability is elevated (SD 102 minutes, Z = 0.41), with sleep irregularity and variability showing modest positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset (sleep SD corr ≈ 0.2–0.22). Interpersonal trust is lower than the sample mean (trust Z = -0.46) and trust correlates negatively with CES-D (corr = -0.41), so lower trust here aligns with higher depressive symptoms. Several daily-behavior items associated in the sample with higher CES-D (greater internet use and more time watching TV; internet Z = 0.85, TV Z = 1.28; correlations 0.25 and 0.13 respectively) are also present at above-average levels.

Conversely, several objective and self-report features suggest factors that would tend to be associated with lower CES-D. The participant endorses regular exercise alone (three or more times per week; exercise Z = 1.07), which in the sample is weakly associated with lower depressive symptoms (corr ≈ -0.09). Global physical-health satisfaction is relatively high (health satisfaction Z = 1.30; corr with CES-D ≈ -0.39), and resting heart rate and mesor are both substantially lower than the sample mean (RHR = 49.4 bpm, Z = -1.04; mesor Z = -1.54); lower resting heart rate/mesor here corresponds weakly to lower CES-D (correlations ~0.19 are small and positive for higher HR with higher CES-D, so lower HR would be modestly protective). Self-esteem is moderately favorable in absolute terms (score = 36), and although its Z-score is slightly below the sample mean (Z = -0.31), the sample-level correlation of self-esteem with CES-D is strong and negative (corr = -0.71) — higher self-esteem would be powerfully protective where present. Finally, wearable-derived daytime heart-rate deviations show notable afternoon/evening activity peaks (large positive deviations 3–6 pm; Z-scores 1.78–2.34) which, in this sample, relate modestly to lower CES-D (hourly correlations typically slightly negative for those times), consistent with periods of daytime engagement/activation.

Wearable circadian and sleep physiology present a mixed picture. Non-parametric circadian regularity is somewhat reduced (interdaily stability = 0.35, Z = -0.49; autocorrelation at 24 hours very low, Z = -1.45), indicating less stable day-to-day heart-rate rhythms; nonparametric instability and greater sleep-timing variability have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample and therefore represent risk. Intraday variability and amplitude metrics are near typical for the cohort (amplitude Z ≈ -0.06; intradaily variability Z ≈ -0.04), and the overall mesor and resting heart rate are below average (protective signal as noted above). Nighttime hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal reductions; daytime elevations in mid-to-late afternoon suggest intact diurnal activation despite the irregular sleep timing. Sleep quantity is slightly below the sample mean (median sleep ≈ 6 h 48 m, Z = -0.48) and sleep duration variability is elevated (SD 118 minutes, Z = 0.39), which — together with late and variable sleep timing — is more consistent with higher CES-D in the sample.

Holistic integration and comparison to the study sample mean CES-D: taken together, the profile is mixed but leans modestly toward factors associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Strong contributors toward higher CES-D include elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep combined with late and irregular sleep timing, reduced positive affect, and lower interpersonal trust; these variables have medium-sized sample correlations with CES-D and are present at above-typical intensities in this participant. Offsetting influences include frequent solitary exercise, relatively high health satisfaction, low resting heart rate/mesor, and some daytime behavioral activation, as well as an overall level of self-esteem that is not markedly low. Considering the balance and the relative strengths of the associations reported in the dataset, the most defensible characterization is that this participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is near the population mean CES-D but somewhat leaning above it (i.e., at or modestly higher than the sample mean of 13.31). This interpretation is probabilistic and should be treated as an integrative, data-driven appraisal rather than a clinical determination; direct CES-D item scores or clinical assessment would be needed for a definitive symptom quantification."
59592,"Clinical-trait and self-report indicators provide multiple signals that would be expected to accompany elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 46, z = +0.46) is modestly above the sample mean and the STAI–CES-D correlation is very large (r = 0.81), which makes this a particularly informative risk indicator. Self-esteem is below the sample average (RSES = 35, z = −0.45) and also strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r = −0.71); lower self-esteem in this participant therefore points toward higher depressive symptom levels. Perceived stress is somewhat elevated (PSS = 23, z = +0.38) and current self-rated happiness is reduced (score = 3.0, z = −0.53), both of which are directionally consistent with greater depressive symptoms. Together, these psychosocial features—especially the high trait anxiety and reduced self-esteem—constitute the strongest evidence in the dataset for an above-average level of depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived physiology and activity patterns also contain several features that tend to accompany higher depressive symptom burden. Resting heart rate is relatively high in this sample (66.1 bpm, z = +0.95) and mesor is above average (77.3, z = +0.46); both heart-rate indices have modest positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), suggesting somewhat higher baseline physiological arousal. Circadian rhythm structure is weakened: interdaily stability is low (0.30, z = −0.90) and intradaily variability is relatively high (0.78, z = +1.65), while cosinor amplitude is blunted (6.93, z = −1.25). These pattern-level features—reduced day-to-day regularity, greater fragmentation of activity/HR, and reduced circadian amplitude—are commonly reported in people with more depressive symptoms and therefore provide convergent physiological evidence toward higher CES-D scores in this participant.

Conversely, several behavioral and subjective indicators point away from a high depressive symptom burden and temper the prior signals. Subjective sleep quality by PSQI is at the conventional cut point (PSQI = 5, z = −0.80) and the wearable-measured median sleep duration is near 7 hours (6 h 57 m, z = −0.29), both suggesting generally adequate sleep quantity and perceived sleep quality. Sleep timing is late (median sleep onset ≈ 01:49) but relatively consistent (sleep onset SD ≈ 39 minutes, z = −0.97), which reduces the concern that highly erratic sleep timing is contributing to mood dysregulation. The participant reports limited use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs, modest alcohol use, and maintains strong academic performance (GPA values are high), all of which are characteristics associated with lower population-level CES-D scores. Socializing and exercise with others are low, which is a potential risk factor, but solitary exercise occurs occasionally; overall lifestyle indicators are mixed with several protective elements present.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the strongest predictors (particularly trait anxiety with very high correlation to CES-D, and self-esteem with a large inverse correlation) together with the physiological circadian signatures that align with greater symptomatology, the preponderance of evidence leans toward the participant having depressive symptom levels above the study sample mean (population mean CES-D = 13.31). This inference is qualified: some important protective signals (adequate sleep duration and subjective sleep quality, limited substance use, high academic performance) reduce the probability of severe or very high CES-D scores and introduce ambiguity about magnitude. In short, the available multimodal data most consistently indicate depressive symptomatology that is likely above the sample mean but not unequivocally extreme; uncertainty remains because key predictors are only modestly displaced from the sample average and because no direct CES-D value is provided.

Limitations and caveats: this analysis synthesizes correlational associations and relative positioning (z-scores) rather than measuring CES-D directly. The strongest contributors to the inference are instruments with the highest empirical correlation to CES-D (STAI and RSES); wearable circadian features provide supportive physiological context but have smaller individual correlations. Any final interpretation would be improved by the participant’s direct CES-D score and by longitudinal context (e.g., whether anxiety and low self-esteem are stable or recently changed)."
89652,"Summary statement
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed profile in which several strong protective psychosocial indicators (low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem and reported happiness, low substance use, and good subjective sleep quality) coexist with a smaller set of risk indicators (elevated perceived stress, objectively short and variable sleep with a very late median sleep onset, reduced daytime regularity and modest circadian fragmentation). Weighing the pattern of predictors and their known correlations with CES‑D, the net signal in these data is more consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.33), although some features indicate elevated risk and introduce uncertainty.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 28; Z ≈ +1.74) and the PSS has a positive association with CES‑D in the sample (correlation ≈ +0.29). Elevated stress is thus a relevant risk factor for higher depressive symptoms in this participant.  
- Objective sleep shows several risk features: median nightly sleep duration is below the sample average (6 h 34 min; Z ≈ −0.76), sleep timing is very late (median sleep start ≈ 02:54), and sleep duration is highly variable (SD ≈ 172 minutes; Z ≈ +1.62). Variability in sleep and delayed timing both have small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES‑D in the dataset (sleep duration SD and sleep start SD correlations ≈ +0.21 and +0.22 respectively) and therefore contribute to risk.  
- Circadian / activity fragmentation is modestly elevated: intradaily variability is higher than average (value 0.73; Z ≈ +1.30), which reflects more fragmented rest–activity/heart‑rate patterns across the day. This measure has a weak negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample, but fragmentation is commonly considered a correlate of poorer mood and sleep consolidation, so it contributes to the risk profile.  
- Wearable physiology shows a resting heart rate slightly above the population mean (60.3 bpm; Z ≈ +0.26) and some daytime heart‑rate elevations in the mid‑afternoon (large positive deviations from mesor, Zs up to ≈ +1.6). Resting HR in these data has a small positive correlation with CES‑D (~+0.19), so it provides weak additional evidence toward elevated symptoms.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Low trait anxiety: STAI–Trait = 35 (Z ≈ −0.62), and in this sample STAI is strongly positively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ +0.81). A relatively low STAI score is therefore a strong protective indicator against elevated depressive symptoms.  
- High self‑esteem and positive affect: Rosenberg self‑esteem is well above average (Z ≈ +0.82) and current reported happiness is elevated (Happy = 5.0; Z ≈ +1.64). Both variables have moderate-to-strong negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample (self‑esteem r ≈ −0.71; happiness r ≈ −0.46), making them important protective signals.  
- Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4; Z ≈ −1.26), which tends to be associated with lower depressive symptoms; this contrasts with the objective sleep shortness/variability but nonetheless suggests the participant does not perceive clinically disruptive sleep problems currently.  
- Low substance use, high interpersonal trust (Trust Z ≈ +2.75), and academic functioning (high GPAs) are additional contextual protections. Reduced engagement in substances and high trust are negatively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (trust r ≈ −0.41), further reducing the likelihood of high depressive symptom burden.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean
When the relative magnitudes of predictors are considered, the strongest single statistical links to CES‑D in this dataset are trait anxiety (STAI) and self‑esteem. The participant’s low STAI score (z ≈ −0.62) and relatively high self‑esteem (z ≈ +0.82), together with elevated reported happiness (z ≈ +1.64) and good subjective sleep (PSQI z ≈ −1.26), pull the overall inference toward lower depressive symptoms. Countervailing factors—most notably high perceived stress (z ≈ +1.74), objective short/variable and late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:54, sleep SD z ≈ +1.62), and modest circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ +1.30)—indicate some ongoing risk for elevated mood symptoms or future worsening, but these factors are either weaker predictors in this sample or partially offset by the stronger protective measures.

Based on this multimodal balance, the most consistent inference is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is below the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.33). The confidence of this conclusion is moderate rather than high: strong protective self‑report markers dominate the predictive signal, but elevated stress and objectively irregular, late sleep introduce a nontrivial risk that could push symptom levels upward over time.

Key caveats
- The CES‑D score itself is not provided here; the conclusion is an inference from correlated predictors rather than a direct symptom measurement.  
- There is some divergence between subjective and objective sleep indicators (good subjective sleep vs. short, late, and variable objective sleep), which complicates interpretation; subjective sleep often relates more strongly to mood than objective measures, but both are relevant.  
- Several wearable correlations with CES‑D are small in magnitude; therefore physiological signals carry weaker weight than the strong psychometric predictors (STAI, self‑esteem, happiness).

Overall, the data portray a participant with several robust psychosocial protections and low trait anxiety—factors that point toward depressive symptoms below the population mean—while also showing elevated perceived stress and disturbed sleep timing and regularity that merit monitoring and could increase risk if those patterns persist."
28724,"Summary statement
Across the self-report and wearable-derived indicators, the participant’s profile contains more signals that align with lower depressive symptom burden than with higher burden. On balance, the pattern of high self-esteem (RSES = 39), high momentary happiness (current = 5, z = 1.64), regular exercise (exercised alone three times/week or more, z = 1.07), low substance use, and objectively adequate and consistent sleep duration (median 7 h 49 m, z = 0.79; sleep-start SD z = -1.22) point toward depressive symptoms below the study sample mean (population CES-D mean = 13.33). At the same time, there are meaningful risk-relevant signals—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), wearable-derived circadian fragmentation (low interdaily stability z = -0.74 and relatively high intradaily variability z = 1.51), and modest physiological signs (resting HR = 59.8, z = 0.20)—that temper that conclusion and suggest areas to monitor.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES-D (protective indicators)
- Strong protective self-report markers: The participant reports very high self-esteem (39/40; correlation with CES-D = -0.71) and above-average momentary happiness (z = 1.64). Given the large negative association between self-esteem and CES-D in this sample, these two measures provide relatively strong evidence for lower depressive symptomatology.  
- Healthy lifestyle and activities: Frequent solitary exercise (three+ times/week, z = 1.07), minimal recreational drug and beer use, limited alcohol consumption, and reasonable social time (1–2 hours/day) are behavioral features generally associated with lower depression risk in the sample.  
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity: Wearable-recorded median sleep duration (≈7 h 49 m, z = 0.79) and low night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD z = -1.22) are typically protective against depressive symptoms and are not consistent with the shortened or highly irregular sleep often seen with higher CES-D scores.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES-D (risk indicators)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The PSQI score of 6 is above the common clinical cut-point (PSQI > 5) and is classified here as “Disturbed Sleep.” Subjective poor sleep quality is a recognized correlate of higher depressive symptoms and thus represents a risk signal that is not fully accounted for by the wearable’s indication of adequate sleep duration.  
- Circadian and activity fragmentation: Heart-rate–derived circadian features show relatively low interdaily stability (0.32, z = -0.74) and elevated intradaily variability (0.76, z = 1.51). These non-parametric features indicate a less regular, more fragmented 24-hour physiological rhythm—patterns that have been linked to higher depressive symptom severity in prior work, even if the sample-level correlations here are modest.  
- Subtle physiological correlates: Resting heart rate is slightly above the study mean (59.8 bpm, z = 0.20) and the cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude (mesor 70.67, z = -0.45; amplitude 9.02, z = -0.57) suggest a somewhat blunted circadian amplitude. The sample correlations between some heart-rate metrics and CES-D (e.g., mesor r ≈ 0.19) are small-to-moderate and indicate that physiological arousal indices should be interpreted as supplementary, not determinative.

Integration of multimodal signals (sleep, circadian, physiology, self-report)
There is a notable divergence between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep quantity/consistency: the participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI while wearable data show near-recommended total sleep time and stable bedtimes. This discrepancy can be clinically meaningful; subjective sleep complaints often co-occur with low mood even when objective duration is adequate. The circadian metrics from heart rate emphasize fragmentation (lower interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability) that could reflect irregular daytime activity-rest cycles, fragmented sleep architecture not captured by gross sleep duration, or variability in autonomic state. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations with an acrophase in the mid-afternoon (≈15:31), which is physiologically plausible and not, by itself, a strong indicator of depression. Taken together, the strongest protective signals are the high self-esteem and momentary happiness scores, supported by healthful behaviors; the strongest risk signals are subjective sleep disturbance and heart-rate–based circadian fragmentation. The physiological correlations with CES-D in this dataset are small-to-moderate, so these wearable features should be considered contributory rather than conclusive.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean
Considering the relative weight of the protective and risk indicators, the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean CES-D score of 13.33. High self-esteem and current happiness—both strongly associated with lower CES-D in this cohort—are primary drivers of this inference. However, the presence of subjective sleep disturbance and wearable-derived circadian irregularity are notable risk factors that could increase susceptibility to mood symptoms over time; they warrant attention despite the overall profile being suggestive of lower depressive symptomatology.

Recommendations for monitoring or follow-up (interpretive, not diagnostic)
- Reconcile subjective vs. objective sleep: given the PSQI > 5 despite adequate sleep duration, brief follow-up questioning or more detailed sleep assessment (sleep diaries, targeted sleep symptom questions) could clarify whether sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, or nocturnal awakenings are present.  
- Monitor circadian regularity: interventions that increase daytime regularity (consistent activity timing, morning light exposure, scheduled exercise) could reduce intradaily fragmentation if desired, and may have downstream benefits for mood.  
- Continue to track self-esteem and momentary positive affect: these are salient protective factors; maintaining activities and supports that sustain them is relevant to ongoing low symptom risk.

Note: this analysis synthesizes cross-sectional self-report and aggregate wearable metrics and uses the provided sample-level correlations to contextualize relationships to CES-D. It does not substitute for a clinical assessment or the participant’s actual CES-D score, which was not provided for this individual."
69831,"Summary of evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms:
Multiple self-report and wearable-derived indicators point toward fewer depressive symptoms than the study average. The participant reports relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 38; z ≈ -0.33) and relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 36; z ≈ -0.31); both of these measures have strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.81, Self‑Esteem r ≈ -0.71) and therefore serve as robust protective signals. Perceived stress is lower than the study mean (PSS = 16; z ≈ -1.53), which also favors lower depressive symptom burden. Objective physiology supports this picture: resting heart rate and mesor are below the sample mean (RHR = 56 bpm, mesor ≈ 71.7 bpm; z ≈ -0.26 and -0.31), circadian amplitude is modestly above average (amplitude z ≈ +0.20) and intradaily variability is low (z ≈ -0.74), all of which suggest reasonably regular, low‑arousal daily physiology that is typically associated with lower CES‑D scores. Finally, median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (median 8:00, z ≈ +1.01), which tends to be protective against depressive symptoms in many cohorts.

Summary of evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms:
There are also notable indicators that point toward elevated depressive symptoms or risk. Subjective sleep quality crosses the conventional threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6; classified as ""disturbed sleep""), despite objectively long total sleep time; this discrepancy (long sleep duration with perceived poor sleep) can be associated with worse mood. The participant’s self-reported current happiness is below the study mean (Happy = 3.0; z ≈ -0.53), and satisfaction with physical health is low (Health satisfaction z ≈ -1.2; correlation with CES‑D ≈ -0.39), both of which correlate with higher depressive symptoms. Behavioral patterns also show limited exercise (reports of little or no exercise; exercise z-scores substantially below the mean) and late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:35 AM) — late timing and low physical activity are commonly linked to higher depressive symptomatology. Several leisure behaviors that show positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (greater listening to music, higher internet usage) are elevated here (listening to music z ≈ +2.06; internet usage z ≈ +1.52); these associations are modest but consistent with some risk.

Integration of wearable circadian, sleep, and behavioral data:
Wearable circadian metrics describe a generally structured heart‑rate rhythm: acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:43 PM), modest amplitude, and low intradaily variability indicate reasonably regular daily structure across the recording period. Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show expected nocturnal suppression and daytime/evening elevations (largest positive deviations in the evening around 7–8 PM), consistent with preserved diurnal activity/arousal. The participant combines relatively long total sleep with a late sleep onset and low variability in sleep start time (sleep start SD ≈ 35 minutes, z ≈ -1.05), suggesting a stable but late schedule rather than erratic timing. The combination of low objective arousal (lower resting HR), stable circadian structure, and long sleep duration balances against the subjective report of disturbed sleep quality and low happiness. Low physical activity frequency (little to no exercise) and time spent in predominantly sedentary or solitary leisure (though socializing time was reported high) may reduce behavioral protective factors even when physiological markers look relatively favorable.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample:
Taking all modalities together — strong protective signals from low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low perceived stress, regular circadian physiology, lower resting heart rate, and objectively long sleep duration — versus moderate risk signals from disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, low exercise, and low happiness/health satisfaction — the overall pattern more closely aligns with lower-than-average depressive symptom burden in this sample. In probabilistic terms, the preponderance of the strongest and most CES‑D–correlated measures (STAI, Self‑Esteem, PSS) indicate an overall CES‑D level likely below the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.32). Important caveats are that no direct CES‑D score for this participant is available here, correlations are sample-level associations that do not establish causation, and some risk factors (especially subjective sleep disturbance and low happiness) warrant clinical attention despite the overall lower inferred symptom level."
44927,"Summary: The participant’s profile contains a mixture of self-report indicators that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms and behavioral/physiological markers that are more characteristic of lower symptom burden. Two self-report traits with strong statistical associations to CES-D in this sample—trait anxiety (STAI) and self-esteem (Rosenberg)—provide some of the most influential information. The participant’s STAI score (40) is in the mid-range and labeled “anxious” in the survey, and STAI is strongly positively correlated with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81). Self-esteem is below the study mean (score 32, z ≈ −0.87) and self-esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ −0.71). Together these two measures point toward a tendency for elevated depressive symptoms relative to peers.

Evidence suggesting a relatively higher CES-D score: Several self-report items that correlate positively with CES-D (or negatively where lower values indicate risk) indicate potential risk. Current self-reported happiness is below average (3.0, z ≈ −0.53; correlation with CES-D ≈ −0.46), and perceived stress is modestly above average (PSS = 22, z ≈ 0.1; correlation ≈ 0.28). Sleep timing and quantity also show risk-relevant features: wearable-recorded median sleep duration is shortened (6 h 34 min, z ≈ −0.77) and the median sleep start time is relatively late (about 00:59), both of which are commonly associated with mood symptoms. Some leisure patterns that show small positive correlations with CES-D—e.g., relatively high reported listening-to-music time (2–3 hours, z ≈ 1.13; r ≈ 0.26) and modest internet use—can in this dataset be associated with higher symptom scores. Although many of these individual correlations are small, the combination of elevated trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, lower self-reported happiness, and shorter/late sleep timing constitutes the strongest cluster of evidence pointing toward elevated depressive symptomatology.

Evidence suggesting a relatively lower CES-D score: Several behavioral and physiological features point in the opposite direction and likely mitigate overall risk. The participant reports minimal substance use (beer/wine/drugs “not at all”), which is protective in this sample. Physical-activity-related indicators are favorable: frequent sports involvement (“three times a week or more,” z ≈ 1.58) is substantially above the sample mean and is associated with lower CES-D (r ≈ −0.15). Interpersonal trust is high (z ≈ 1.15; r ≈ −0.41), which is a moderately strong protective correlate. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, z ≈ −0.8) is at or just below the threshold for disturbance and therefore not strongly indicative of disturbed sleep despite the shorter objective duration. Wearable physiology also shows features consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness and regular daily organization: resting heart rate is low (54.6 bpm, z ≈ −0.42), circadian nonparametric metrics (interdaily stability and intradaily variability) are near the sample mean, amplitude and mesor are only modestly lower than average, and naps are rare. These patterns reflect regularity and physical fitness that, in this dataset, tend to be associated with lower CES-D scores.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to sample mean: Weighting the available evidence, the strongest single predictors in this dataset are the trait measures (STAI and self-esteem), both of which are strongly associated with CES-D scores in the study sample; these push the inference toward elevated depressive symptoms. However, multiple substantive behavioral and physiological protective factors (regular sports participation, low substance use, high interpersonal trust, low resting heart rate, and generally regular circadian organization with acceptable subjective sleep quality) counterbalance that risk. Taken together, the balance of risk and protective features suggests that the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely near or modestly above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.33). In other words, the data are most consistent with a symptom level that is not at the low extreme of the sample and may be slightly elevated relative to the mean, but not clearly at the upper extremes of the CES-D distribution.

Caveats: This inference integrates correlational associations from the study sample and both self-report and wearable measures; it is not a diagnostic statement. The STAI and Rosenberg self-esteem scores carry disproportionate predictive weight here because of their large sample correlations with CES-D. Objective wearable signals in this case provide important protective context but have smaller direct correlations with CES-D in the sample. For any clinical or intervention decision-making, direct assessment of CES-D and clinical interview would be required."
71894,"Summary of features that align with relatively higher depressive symptoms: The participant reports markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 64, z = 2.24), a variable that in this sample shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81); this is one of the clearest signals in the profile that maps onto higher depressive symptom levels. Self-esteem is substantially below the study mean (Rosenberg = 19, z = −2.70) and is moderately strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = −0.70), which likewise points toward elevated depressive symptoms. Current self-rated happiness is low (2.0, z = −1.61; r = −0.46), health satisfaction is low (z = −1.95; r = −0.39), and the PSQI score indicates disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6). Behavioral indicators that also align with higher CES-D in this sample include heavy internet use (more than 4 hours/day, z = 2.19; r = 0.24) and extended listening-to-music time (z = 2.06; r = 0.24). Taken together, the strongest contributors to an elevated CES-D estimate are the very high trait anxiety and very low self-esteem, supported by low subjective happiness and disturbed sleep.

Summary of features that align with relatively lower depressive symptoms: Several behavioral and objective markers are relatively protective or neutral with respect to depressive symptoms in this data. The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week, z = 1.07) and a moderate level of socializing (3–4 hours, z = 1.74); these behaviors correlate weakly or negatively with CES-D in the sample and are conventionally associated with lower depressive symptoms. Wearable-derived circadian regularity metrics are not strongly disrupted: interdaily stability is modest (0.47, z = 0.50), intradaily variability is only mildly elevated (0.66, z = 0.81), and the autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (z = 1.48), consistent with a generally regular day–night structure across the recording period. Sleep timing is relatively consistent (sleep start SD ≈ 58 minutes, z = −0.56) and daytime napping is absent (mean daily naps = 0.0, z = −0.86). Substance use is minimal. These factors provide evidence that the participant maintains several lifestyle patterns (regular activity rhythm, routine sleep timing, frequent exercise, social contact, low substance use) that would tend to mitigate depressive symptom severity.

Wearable physiological detail and integration with self-report: Objective physiology provides mixed signals. Resting heart rate and MESOR are somewhat above the study mean (RHR = 63.6 bpm, MESOR ≈ 80.9; z ≈ 0.6–0.95; r ≈ 0.19), which in this sample associates weakly with higher CES-D; circadian amplitude derived from heart rate is lower than average (amplitude 8.47, z = −0.75; r = −0.10), a pattern that can reflect blunted day–night physiological variation sometimes observed with depressive states. Aggregated hourly deviations show very large morning heart-rate increases (6–8 a.m. values with z > 4) indicating a pronounced morning activation, and daytime dips in the early afternoon; these hourly deviations themselves have small correlations with CES-D in the sample, so their relevance is uncertain, but the reduced amplitude and slightly elevated mean heart rate modestly support higher symptom burden. Objective sleep duration (median ≈ 6 h 43 min, z = −0.58) is slightly below the sample mean but not severely so, and night-to-night sleep variability is relatively low (SD ≈ 54 minutes, z = −1.06), which argues against highly fragmented or irregular sleep at the wearable-derived level despite the participant’s report of disturbed sleep.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most diagnostic signals in this multimodal profile are the self-report psychological measures—very high trait anxiety and very low self-esteem—both of which have large sample correlations with CES-D and therefore carry substantial weight in estimating depressive symptom level. Several objective and behavioral markers (regular circadian pattern, consistent sleep timing, frequent exercise, active socializing, minimal substance use) point in the opposite direction but have weaker associations with CES-D in this sample. On balance, the profile is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.25). Given the magnitude of the anxiety and self-esteem deviations relative to the sample and their high correlations with CES-D, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely elevated relative to the sample average (i.e., above the population mean and above the sample median), although objective behavioral rhythms and some lifestyle factors do not reflect severe circadian disruption and may moderate symptom expression.

Key caveats: This inference weighs heavily on self-report scales that have strong sample correlations with CES-D; wearable-derived indicators in this case are mixed and show only modest associations with CES-D. The analysis is probabilistic and based on correlational patterns in the study sample rather than a direct CES-D score for the participant."
30453,"Summary overview: The available self-report and wearable-derived data show a mixed but convergent pattern of risk markers for elevated depressive symptoms alongside several behavioral assets that could mitigate risk. Several strong self-report indicators (notably very poor subjective sleep quality, elevated trait anxiety, and low self-esteem) and physiological/behavioral features (short, variable sleep and subtle circadian disruption with a modestly elevated resting heart rate) point toward higher-than-average depressive symptom burden. By contrast, repeated engagement in group exercise and team sports, minimal substance use, and an absence of daytime napping are behavioral features that tend to associate with lower depression scores. Taking the full multimodal profile into account, the balance of evidence indicates the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.26).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Subjective affect and trait measures: The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI = 51; Z = 0.96) and substantially low self-esteem (Rosenberg = 27; Z = -1.57). These measures are strongly associated with depressive symptoms in this sample (STAI–trait correlation with CES-D = 0.81; self-esteem correlation = -0.70), making them high-weight indicators of elevated depressive symptomatology. Current self-rated happiness is low (score = 2.0; Z = -1.61) and perceived stress is above average (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38), both of which are consistent with greater depressive symptoms (happiness correlation = -0.46; stress correlation = 0.28).
- Sleep-related risk: Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor (PSQI = 16; Z = 4.29), an extreme outlier in this sample and a robust correlate of depression and daytime dysfunction. Wearable metrics corroborate disturbed sleep: median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 25 min; Z = -0.96) and night-to-night variability is high (sleep duration SD = 145 min; Z = 1.0). The participant also has a late median sleep onset (01:21) and somewhat variable sleep start times (SD = 95 min), patterns that often co-occur with mood symptoms. The combination of severe subjective sleep disturbance and objective short and variable sleep strengthens the inference toward elevated depressive symptoms.
- Circadian and physiological signs: Heart rate–based circadian metrics show some indications of dampened rhythm and physiological activation consistent with stress/depressive states: amplitude is below the sample mean (8.82; Z = -0.63), interdaily stability is reduced (0.30; Z = -0.9), and resting heart rate is elevated relative to peers (67.5 bpm; Z = 1.11). Several of these features have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., mesor and resting HR correlations ≈ 0.19), and together they are consistent with increased physiological arousal and circadian irregularity that often accompany higher depressive symptoms.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms or buffering factors
- Social/behavioral protective factors: The participant reports frequent organized or group physical activity (exercised with others: three times a week or more; Z = 1.23; sports three times a week or more; Z = 1.58). These activity patterns have modest negative correlations with CES-D in the sample (≈ -0.16 to -0.24) and are well-established behavioral buffers against depressive symptoms. The participant reports negligible substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational/non-prescribed drugs all “not at all”), which removes a common lifestyle risk factor for higher depression scores.
- Low daytime napping and engagement in structured hobbies: Mean daily naps are effectively zero (Z = -0.86), and the participant devotes time to reading and other sedentary hobbies (reading Z = 2.28) that can reflect constructive or routinized daytime activities. These stable daytime habits, when paired with regular team-based exercise, may partially mitigate the impact of other risk factors.
- Mixed signals in subjective recreation: The participant reports extensive music listening (>4 hours; Z = 2.06), but in this dataset music-listening showed a small positive correlation with CES-D (0.24). Thus some leisure patterns may represent either coping strategies or markers of mood disturbances; they do not function clearly as protective indicators in this sample.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study sample mean
Balancing the evidence, the profile contains several high-weight indicators of elevated depressive symptoms—particularly severe subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = 4.29), high trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.96 with correlation 0.81 to CES-D), low self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.57, correlation -0.70), and moderate physiological/circadian dysregulation (reduced amplitude, lower interdaily stability, elevated resting HR). Although there are meaningful protective behaviors (regular group exercise and sports participation; minimal substance use; no naps), these do not appear sufficient to offset the constellation of strong risk markers. Therefore, the most defensible inference from the provided multimodal data is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean CES-D score of 13.26. Given the strength of the subjective sleep and anxiety indicators, the participant may fall at or above the upper half of the sample distribution (i.e., nearer or above the median and possibly toward the 75th percentile), although the exact CES-D score is not available.

Limitations and uncertainty
This inference is probabilistic and indirect: no CES-D raw score for the participant was provided, and associations are derived from correlational relationships within the sample. Some wearable correlations with CES-D are small, and several behaviors (e.g., high reading, music listening) have ambiguous relationships with depressive symptoms. Consequently, confidence is moderate rather than definitive. Integrating a contemporaneous CES-D score and clinical interview or additional longitudinal symptom tracking would substantially refine the assessment."
66047,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptomatology
The participant’s self-report profile contains several strong signals that, in the present sample, are reliably associated with higher CES‑D scores. Trait anxiety is markedly elevated (STAI = 73, z = 3.13) and this measure correlates strongly with CES‑D in the study (r = 0.81), making it one of the most potent risk indicators in the dataset. Self‑esteem is low (RSES = 21, z = −2.42) and shows a substantial negative correlation with CES‑D (r = −0.70), again supporting elevated depressive symptom risk. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, z = 1.52, classified as disturbed sleep), which in combination with elevated perceived stress (PSS = 24, z = 0.65) and low health satisfaction (z = −2.28) aligns with common psychosocial correlates of higher depression scores. Behavioral markers that co-occur with higher CES‑D in this sample include very high passive screen time — watching TV/videos >4 hours (z = 3.17) and internet use >4 hours (z = 2.19) — and low physical activity (exercise alone and with others both with negative z‑scores around −1.2 to −1.6). Taken together, these self‑report and behavioral features (high anxiety, low self‑esteem, disturbed sleep, high sedentary recreation, low exercise, and elevated stress/poor health satisfaction) form a convergent pattern that is typically associated with CES‑D scores above the sample mean.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptomatology
There are several features that temper the risk signal and point toward more normative functioning on some objective dimensions. Median nocturnal sleep duration recorded by the wearable is within a typical range (7 h 15 min, z = 0.08), and night‑to‑night variability in sleep onset and duration is not extreme (sleep start SD z ≈ 0.03; duration SD z ≈ 0.12), which are not strongly predictive of higher CES‑D in this sample. Substance use and recreational drug use are minimal (alcohol and non‑prescribed drug z‑scores are negative), which reduces proximal behavioral risk factors commonly linked to increased depressive symptoms. Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate (interdaily stability = 0.43, z = 0.17) are near the study average, and amplitude and non‑parametric variability measures are only modestly different from the sample mean; none of these wearable circadian metrics show strong correlations with CES‑D in the dataset. These protective or neutral elements suggest that not all behavioral or physiological systems are dysregulated and provide some counterbalance to the elevated self‑report risks.

Physiological and wearable‑derived observations and their behavioral meaning
Cardiovascular markers show modest physiological arousal: resting heart rate is somewhat elevated (RHR = 68.4 bpm, z = 1.22) and the MESOR is above average (80.2, z = 0.85); both metrics have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample. The cosinor acrophase occurs in the early evening (≈6:35 PM) and the amplitude is slightly below average (z = −0.31), which together with a modestly increased intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.24) may reflect blunted day–night autonomic contrast but not a profoundly disordered circadian system. The participant’s aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show higher-than‑mesor values around late evening and midnight hours and pronounced negative deviations in the early morning—consistent with late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:40 AM) and an evening‑shifted activity/sleep schedule. Notably, the participant naps more than the typical study participant (mean daily naps z = 2.4), and nap frequency in this sample is positively associated with CES‑D; this could reflect daytime sleepiness or compensatory naps associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep or low daytime activation.

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement
Balancing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed but overall elevated risk profile for depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. The strongest single indicators—very high trait anxiety (STAI z = 3.13), low self‑esteem (RSES z = −2.42), poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI z = 1.52), elevated perceived stress, limited physical activity, and high sedentary screen time (TV and internet use z’s >2)—converge on an interpretation of higher than average depressive symptom burden. Objective wearable signals (somewhat elevated resting heart rate, increased nap frequency, late sleep timing) are consistent with that interpretation but are more moderate in magnitude. Several neutral or protective features (typical median sleep duration, low substance use, and relatively preserved circadian stability measures) moderate the overall risk estimate but do not outweigh the strong self‑report indicators.

Relative to the study population mean CES‑D of 13.22 (SD = 9.47), the constellation of indicators makes it most consistent that this participant’s depressive symptom level would be above the population mean. This assessment is probabilistic and based on convergent associations in the data; it does not constitute a clinical diagnosis. Limitations to bear in mind include reliance on cross‑sectional correlations, absence of the participant’s actual CES‑D raw score in the provided inputs, and the inability of aggregated heart‑rate profiles to capture day‑to‑day temporal context or causal directionality."
79834,"Overall inference relative to sample mean
Taking the multimodal evidence together, the balance of signals in the self-report and wearable data indicates that this participant’s depressive-symptom burden is likely below the study sample mean CES-D (population mean = 13.32). This inference rests primarily on a pattern of low trait anxiety (STAI = 37), relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 37), favorable objective sleep quantity and circadian regularity, and a low resting heart rate; several of those measures have moderate-to-strong statistical associations with CES-D in the sample and point away from elevated depressive symptoms. That said, the data also include several modest risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, lower reported happiness, low interpersonal trust, limited group-based exercise and recreational engagement) that temper confidence and suggest monitoring rather than a categorical conclusion.

Features that support a relatively low CES-D score
Several robust protective signals appear in the dataset. Trait anxiety is low (STAI = 37; z ≈ -0.43) and the STAI–CES-D correlation in this sample is strong and positive (r = 0.81), meaning lower trait anxiety strongly predicts lower depressive symptoms—this is one of the most influential single indicators. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 37; z ≈ -0.17) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D in the study (r = -0.71), again favoring lower depressive symptoms. Objective physiological and circadian markers are also generally supportive: resting heart rate is low (52.9 bpm; z ≈ -0.62), mesor is low-moderate, and circadian amplitude is above average (amplitude z ≈ 0.56) with relatively low intradaily variability (z ≈ -0.95) and modest interdaily stability (z ≈ -0.33). Low intradaily variability and a clear amplitude/24-hour structure are typically associated with healthier daily organization, which in aggregate is consistent with lower CES-D. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is long compared with peers (median = 8 h 18 min; z ≈ 1.39), which is not, in this dataset, associated with higher CES-D (sample correlation ≈ 0.0) and may reflect adequate opportunity for physiological recovery.

Features that support a relatively higher CES-D score or increase uncertainty
Other signals point toward elevated risk or create ambiguity. Subjective sleep quality meets a common clinical threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which has relevance because subjective sleep problems often co-occur with depressive symptoms even when objective sleep duration appears adequate. Self-reported current happiness is modestly low (score = 3.0; z ≈ -0.53) and correlates negatively with CES-D (r ≈ -0.46), which suggests some affective symptoms that could elevate the CES-D. Interpersonal trust is low (z ≈ -1.42) and shows a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.41), indicating lower social trust could relate to greater depressive symptoms. Behavioral indicators of reduced social or group activity—exercising alone very infrequently and no group exercise or sports—may contribute to risk because social/behavioral engagement is commonly protective. Stress in this case is not high relative to the sample (PSS score 19, z ≈ -0.71), but the stress–CES-D correlation in the sample is positive (r ≈ 0.28), so if stress were to increase it could push CES-D higher. Overall, these risk signals are moderate in magnitude and do not outweigh the stronger protective indicators but they do increase uncertainty and suggest heterogeneity across domains.

Physiological timing and heart-rate detail
The participant’s aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a strong nocturnal decline (large negative deviations during typical sleep hours) and pronounced elevations in the late-afternoon and evening window (largest positive deviations at 6–10 PM). The acrophase (~5:23 PM) and positive circadian amplitude indicate a clear daily heart-rate rhythm with higher activity/arousal in late afternoon-to-evening and marked physiological quiescence overnight. In this dataset, most hourly heart-rate deviations have weak correlations with CES-D (small effect sizes), so these timing patterns are not strongly predictive of depressive symptoms in the study sample. The combination of clear diurnal rhythm, relatively low intradaily variability, low resting heart rate, and substantial nocturnal heart-rate decline is more consistent with preserved physiological regulation than with a circadian pattern typical of higher depressive symptomatology.

Holistic conclusion and caveats
On balance, the strongest, most highly associated predictors in the sample (low trait anxiety and high self-esteem) favor an inferred CES-D level below the study population mean. Objective physiology and circadian structure largely reinforce that inference. However, subjective sleep disturbance, lower momentary happiness, low interpersonal trust, and limited social/group activity present moderate countervailing evidence that could elevate symptom burden in other contexts. Given these mixed signals, the most defensible statement is that the participant’s depressive-symptom level is likely below the population mean but not at an extreme low; there are specific psychosocial and subjective-sleep domains that merit attention because they could increase risk if conditions change. Finally, this inference is probabilistic and based on correlational population patterns and cross-sectional measures; a direct CES-D score (if available) or clinical assessment would provide the definitive individual-level measure."
33133,"Overview: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a mixed but coherent profile. Several high-salience self-report indicators (notably trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, and perceived stress) align with patterns that, in this sample, are strongly associated with higher CES‑D scores. At the same time, there are meaningful protective signals (notably relatively high self‑esteem, frequent solitary exercise, and moderate satisfaction with physical health) that counterbalance some risk. Considering the relative weight of these findings, the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels that are above the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.26), although the inference is probabilistic rather than diagnostic.

Factors indicating relatively higher CES‑D symptoms: The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76) is a prominent risk marker given the very large correlation of that scale with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81). Subjective sleep disturbance is also marked (PSQI = 11; Z = 1.98, classified as disturbed sleep), and poor sleep quality is commonly linked with higher depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 24; Z = 0.65) and shows a positive association with CES‑D in the sample. Lower current happiness (self‑rated = 3.0; Z = -0.53) and lower interpersonal trust (Z = -0.78) are additional self-report features that, in this dataset, point toward greater depressive symptoms. Behavioral habits that covary with higher CES‑D here include above‑average daily internet use (3–4 hours; Z = 1.52) and limited social exercise (reports of not exercising with others; Z = -1.58), both of which are associated with increased depressive symptoms in the study correlations.

Factors indicating relatively lower CES‑D symptoms: Several measures provide a countervailing signal. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 37; Z ≈ -0.17 relative to the sample mean, with self‑esteem showing a strong negative correlation with CES‑D, r ≈ -0.71), which is protective. The participant reports frequent exercise alone (three or more times per week; Z = 1.07), and physical activity in this sample is weakly associated with lower CES‑D scores. Health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.8) and BMI/health indicators do not present a strong risk signal here beyond being contextual. Objective resting heart rate and mean heart‑rate MESOR are close to the sample mean (RHR ≈ 58.6 bpm; MESOR ≈ 73.5 bpm; both Z ≈ 0), which neither strongly elevates nor reduces estimated depressive symptom burden and can be seen as neutral-to-slightly protective compared with profiles that show elevated resting physiology.

Wearable circadian and sleep physiology interpretation: Objective sleep is somewhat short (median duration ~6 h 38 min; Z = -0.68) but not extreme, and night‑to‑night sleep duration variability is below average (SD ≈ 63 min; Z = -0.85), which can be protective against mood dysregulation. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI), however, is notably poor and therefore is a more salient sleep‑related risk signal than the modestly short objective sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics show modest signs of rhythm fragmentation: intradaily variability is elevated relative to the sample (IV Z = 0.6), while interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are near the mean. Amplitude from cosinor analysis is slightly lower than average (Z = -0.22), and acrophase is in the late afternoon (~4:25 PM). These wearable patterns (some daytime fragmentation, reduced amplitude, and higher intradaily variability) are consistent with circadian irregularity that is often observed with higher depressive symptom burden, although the effects in this participant are moderate rather than extreme. Hourly heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced morning elevation (especially 8–9 AM), which likely reflects regular daytime activity and may be interpreted as partial preservation of daily structure — a factor that can be protective.

Synthesis and comparative statement: Balancing the evidence, the most influential indicators in this case are high trait anxiety, pronounced subjective sleep disturbance, and elevated perceived stress — all of which, in this sample, have relatively strong associations with higher CES‑D scores. Protective factors (notably high self‑esteem, regular exercise, and reasonable health satisfaction) mitigate but do not fully offset the risk signals. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with depressive symptom levels that are above the study population mean CES‑D score of 13.26. This conclusion is probabilistic and should be interpreted as indicating relatively elevated depressive symptoms compared with the study sample rather than as a clinical diagnosis; targeted clinical assessment or follow‑up symptom measurement would be required to confirm severity and guide action."
47810,"Summary and comparative statement
Based on the combination of self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed profile with both clear protective characteristics and several behavioral/physiological indicators commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. When these signals are integrated, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall level of depressive symptoms is likely near or slightly below the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.3). This inference emphasizes relatively strong protective trait indicators (notably high self-esteem and comparatively low trait anxiety) that reduce the likelihood of a substantially elevated CES-D score, while also acknowledging sleep- and rhythm-related risk factors that could push symptom levels upward toward the sample norm.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptom levels
Several objective and subjective sleep and circadian features point toward risk. The participant’s PSQI score is 9 (z = 1.05; classification = “disturbed sleep”), indicating clinically meaningful subjective sleep disturbance. Wearable sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 40 minutes (z = -0.65) and a late median sleep onset (01:26 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ~65 minutes, z = -0.4). Napping frequency is elevated (mean daily naps = 0.27, z = 2.34; correlation with CES-D = +0.21), which commonly co-occurs with short night sleep and has a modest positive relationship with CES-D in this sample. Circadian fragmentation is pronounced on the activity/heart-rate side: intradaily variability is high (value = 0.83, z = 2.01), and 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively low (value = 0.21, z = -0.95), suggesting less stable day–night structure. Subjective indicators that track with depressed mood are also present: current happiness is below average (score = 3.0, z = -0.53; correlation with CES-D = -0.46) and health satisfaction is lower than average (score = 3.33, z = -0.7; corr = -0.39). Together, these sleep/circadian disturbances and lower momentary well‑being are the most salient risk-related signals in the dataset.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptom levels
Several robust trait-level and behavioral markers argue for lower depressive symptomatology. The participant’s Rosenberg Self-Esteem score is very high (39/40; z = 0.11) and self-esteem has a strong negative correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = -0.71), which is a substantial protective factor. Trait anxiety (STAI-Trait = 37; z = -0.43) is below sample mean and, given the strong positive sample correlation between STAI and CES-D (r ≈ 0.81), this lower trait anxiety strongly favors lower depressive symptom scores. Substance use is minimal (no beer, no recreational or non-prescribed drugs) and alcohol use is limited (wine/liquor 1–2×/week), factors that generally reduce risk. The participant’s academic performance (GPA consistently in the mid-3.5s) and engagement in sports/exercise at least weekly (sports frequency z = 0.91; exercise with others z = 0.53) are additional protective behavioral markers. Cardiovascular indicators provide a neutral-to-protective signal: resting heart rate is relatively low (56.3 bpm, z = -0.22) and mesor/amplitude parameters do not indicate a markedly blunted or dysregulated cardiac rhythm that would clearly point to elevated depressive symptoms.

Holistic integration and interpretation
Balancing the above, the most influential protective signals are the participant’s high self-esteem and below-average trait anxiety—two markers that, in this sample, have some of the strongest associations with lower CES-D scores. Conversely, the most influential risk signals are disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9), objectively short and late sleep timing with elevated napping, and high intradaily variability of activity/heart-rate rhythms. Those sleep/circadian disturbances are consistent with elevated mood symptoms in the literature and have modest positive relationships with CES-D in the current sample. Because the strongest statistical associations in this dataset are tied to trait measures (self-esteem, anxiety), and those measures point toward lower depressive symptoms, the integrated estimate is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is probably near or moderately below the study population mean rather than substantially above it. Put succinctly: the participant’s profile is not strongly suggestive of a high CES-D score relative to the sample, but sleep and circadian irregularities represent important areas of vulnerability that could raise symptom levels and warrant monitoring.

Limitations and caveats
This inference is probabilistic and indirect: it synthesizes multiple correlational signals rather than a direct CES-D score for this individual. Some correlations provided in the dataset are small in magnitude, and wearable-derived circadian measures reflect aggregated patterns rather than day-specific reactivity. The data support targeted attention to sleep timing, consolidation (reduce fragmented sleep and high napping), and circadian regularity because these domains are the clearest actionable risk areas despite the participant’s otherwise protective trait profile."
58196,"Summary and overall impression
Across the self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed pattern of risk and protective features for depressive symptoms. Several strong self-report indicators that have robust negative correlations with CES-D (notably high self-esteem and high momentary happiness, and low trait anxiety) point toward relatively low depressive symptomatology. In contrast, objective circadian irregularity and some sleep/behavioral markers (shorter median sleep duration, later sleep onset, greater intradaily variability, and modestly elevated perceived stress and napping) point to features that are more commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Integrating these signals, the preponderance and magnitude of protective psychosocial signals outweigh the more modest physiological/behavioral risks; therefore the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is most consistent with being below the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.33).

Protective factors (indicative of relatively lower CES-D)
- Strong self-report indicators associated with lower depressive symptoms: trait anxiety is low (STAI = 31, z = −1.02; the STAI–Trait score correlates strongly with CES-D in the sample, r ≈ 0.81), self-reported current happiness is high (Happy = 5.0, z = 1.64; correlation with CES-D r ≈ −0.46), and self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (SelfEsteem z = 1.10; this variable has a strong negative correlation with CES-D, r ≈ −0.71). Taken together, these psychosocial markers carry relatively large effect-size associations with depressive symptoms in the study sample and point toward fewer depressive symptoms for this participant.
- Good subjective sleep quality and functioning: the PSQI score is 4 (z = −1.26), classified as “Good Sleep” and suggesting minimal subjective sleep disturbance; health satisfaction is relatively high (z = 1.38). High frequency of exercise (exercising alone and with others, both z > 1) and strong academic performance (high GPA) also reflect preserved daily functioning and engagement, which are typically protective against higher CES-D scores.
- Resting cardiovascular tone: the participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are below the sample mean (RHR = 53.4, mesor = 66.6; z ≈ −0.5 to −1.0). Lower resting heart rate and lower overall heart-rate mesor are not indicative of elevated sympathetic arousal and, in this context, align with other protective signals.

Risk factors (indicative of relatively higher CES-D)
- Circadian and activity-regularity features: objective circadian metrics show relative irregularity and fragmentation — interdaily stability is below the sample average (0.34, z = −0.57), autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.22, z = −0.87), and intradaily variability is elevated (0.66, z = 0.81). These features indicate weaker day-to-day regularity and greater within-day fragmentation of heart-rate–based rhythm; such patterns are modestly associated with depressive symptoms in many studies and represent a physiological behavioral risk domain here.
- Sleep quantity and timing: median nightly sleep duration is shorter than the sample average (6 h 33 m, z = −0.79) and the median sleep start time is relatively late (about 01:02). Shorter sleep duration and later bedtimes are correlated with higher CES-D in some samples; in this participant they are modest risk signals despite good subjective sleep quality (PSQI). Sleep start time variability and sleep-duration standard deviation are not extreme but not strongly protective (SD of start time ≈ 72 minutes).
- Daytime napping and perceived stress: mean daily naps are somewhat elevated relative to the sample (0.15 naps/day, z = 0.94) and naps here show a modest positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.21). Perceived stress is moderately elevated (PSS = 24, z = 0.65), and stress has a positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.28); both are modest risk indicators.

Physiological diurnal profile and how it informs affective interpretation
- Circadian amplitude and timing: cosinor-derived amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude z = −0.63) with acrophase in the mid-afternoon (≈ 3:36 PM). Reduced amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm can reflect blunted diurnal variation in physiological arousal, a pattern sometimes associated with depressive symptoms; however, the correlation between amplitude and CES-D in this sample is small (r ≈ −0.10). The hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected nighttime suppression (large negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevation at mid-afternoon — a preserved day–night contrast is present, albeit with smaller-than-average amplitude. Thus, while there is some evidence for circadian blunting and reduced day-to-day regularity (risk), basic diurnal structure (nighttime decline and afternoon peak) remains intact (neutral-to-mildly protective).
- Integration with subjective sleep: despite objectively shorter median sleep and later sleep onset, the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI). This divergence suggests that objective sleep timing irregularity is present without pronounced subjective dissatisfaction — an important nuance. Subjective sleep quality and high self-rated happiness and self-esteem tend to carry more weight clinically for current mood than modest objective irregularities when considered together.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Balancing all modalities, the strongest and most strongly CES-D–related signals in this dataset are psychosocial: low trait anxiety (z ≈ −1.02), high self-esteem (z ≈ 1.10) and high current happiness (z ≈ 1.64), each of which has a nontrivial negative correlation with CES-D in the sample. Although there are objectively measurable circadian irregularities (lower interdaily stability, lower 24-h autocorrelation, higher intradaily variability), shorter median sleep duration, and modestly elevated perceived stress and napping — all of which point in the direction of increased depressive symptoms — these risk signals are of smaller magnitude and/or have weaker correlations with CES-D in the sample. On balance, the composite profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.33). This conclusion emphasizes relative positioning in the sample distribution rather than ruling out the possibility of episodic or domain-specific symptoms; the circadian and sleep irregularities merit monitoring because they can precede or exacerbate affective changes even when global symptom burden is low."
62246,"Summary and protective indicators: Several convergent signals in the self-report and wearable data point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden compared with the study sample. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82), and trait anxiety in this dataset is strongly positively correlated with CES‑D (r = 0.81); a low STAI therefore provides a robust protective signal. Self‑esteem is high (RSES Z = 0.96) and self‑esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = -0.71), which further suggests lower depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 3, Z = -1.72) and objective sleep measures are consistent with healthy sleep: median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 39 min (Z = 0.59), low night‑to‑night variability in duration (SD Z = -0.82), median sleep‑start near midnight, and essentially no naps (Z = -0.86). Actigraphy/heart‑rate circadian metrics show a clear, regular rhythm: modest interdaily stability (Z = 0.25), low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = -1.59), a measurable amplitude (Z = 0.47), and normal resting heart rate (57 bpm). These features (regular circadian pattern, stable sleep, low anxiety, high self‑esteem) are each associated in the sample with lower CES‑D scores or are plausibly protective.

Signals that could indicate higher depressive symptoms or warrant caution: There are a few features that either weakly favor higher symptom burden or require cautious interpretation. The participant’s reported current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (Happy Z = -0.53), and perceived stress is near average (PSS = 21, Z = -0.17); perceived stress correlates positively with CES‑D (r = 0.28). Average 1–2 times/week alcohol use (beer/wine Z ≈ 1.0) is higher than the median participant but has negligible correlation with CES‑D in this dataset. Some wearable-derived measures show modest associations in the direction of higher CES‑D (for example, mesor is somewhat elevated, Mesor Z = 0.56, with a small positive correlation to CES‑D r ≈ 0.19), but these associations are weak and the physiological profile overall (low resting HR, preserved amplitude, clear nocturnal HR drop) argues more for intact autonomic regulation than for a pattern typical of elevated depressive symptoms.

Circadian and physiological interpretation: Heart‑rate based circadian features indicate a well‑defined daily rhythm with a daytime peak in the mid‑afternoon (acrophase ≈ 4:23 PM) and pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (large negative deviations overnight), consistent with consolidated nighttime rest and daytime activity. Low intradaily variability (Z = -1.59) and a measurable amplitude suggest low fragmentation and preserved daily structure, features that are generally associated with lower depressive symptomatology in this sample. Resting heart rate is low-normal (57 bpm), which when combined with stable sleep and low nap frequency, points away from physiological dysregulation commonly linked with higher depression scores.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Considering the weight of evidence—particularly the combination of low trait anxiety (strong positive CES‑D correlate), high self‑esteem (strong negative CES‑D correlate), good subjective and objective sleep, regular circadian structure, and absence of prominent physiological dysregulation—the data most strongly support that this participant’s depressive symptom level is below the study sample mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.33). This conclusion balances a few modest or neutral risk indicators (slightly lower self‑reported happiness, average perceived stress, somewhat elevated alcohol frequency) against multiple stronger protective signals.

Limitations and caveats: This inference is probabilistic and based on correlational associations and aggregated physiological summaries rather than a directly reported CES‑D score. Several correlations in the dataset are small, and some measures (e.g., the RSES value reported exceeds the usual scale range) warrant careful interpretation. Aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations and cosinor metrics reflect average patterns across the recording period and cannot identify short episodes of mood deterioration. Use these conclusions as an integrated risk/benefit synthesis rather than a diagnostic statement; direct CES‑D assessment or clinical interview would be required for an individualized determination."
55424,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms:
The participant’s self-report profile contains several strong signals that, in this sample, are associated with elevated CES-D scores. Trait anxiety (STAI = 57, z = +1.55) is substantially above the study mean and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most potent risk-related signals in the dataset. Subjective sleep disturbance is also pronounced (PSQI = 14, z = +3.37), indicating clinically meaningful poor sleep quality; poor PSQI scores are commonly linked with higher depressive symptomatology and this z-score is one of the largest in the record. Self-esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 32, z = −0.87) and has a strong negative correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = −0.71), which further points toward higher depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is low (value = 2.0, z = −1.61) and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23, z ≈ +0.38; r with CES-D ≈ 0.28), both of which conventionally co-occur with higher depressive symptoms. Together, these self-report measures (high anxiety, very poor subjective sleep, lower self-esteem, low happiness, and some elevation in stress) form a convergent set of risk indicators that, in aggregate, predict CES-D scores above the population mean.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms:
Objective behavioral and circadian/wearable-derived metrics provide a countervailing set of features more typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Nighttime heart-rate reductions are pronounced (large negative deviations from mesor across the 12am–6am window, with especially large z-scores at several night hours), and the participant’s resting heart rate and mesor are slightly below the study mean (RHR = 57.6 bpm, mesor ≈ 73 bpm, both z near −0.1), which can reflect intact nocturnal recovery. Circadian structure from heart-rate cosinor and non-parametric metrics is reasonably robust: amplitude is slightly above average (z ≈ +0.34), acrophase is in the mid-afternoon (3:36 PM) reflecting a clear daytime peak, interdaily stability is near average (z ≈ +0.09), and intradaily variability is lower-than-average (z ≈ −0.46), together indicating relatively consistent daily structure and less within-day fragmentation. Wearable sleep duration is near or slightly above average (median ≈ 7 h 24 m, z ≈ +0.27) and night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is lower than typical (sleep SD z-scores ≈ −0.5 to −0.7), suggesting consistent sleep timing despite poor subjective sleep quality. Social/behavioral supports that are typically protective are present to some extent: the participant reports exercising with others three or more times per week (z ≈ +1.23; correlation with CES-D ≈ −0.24), and overall health satisfaction is modestly above average (z ≈ +0.38; r ≈ −0.40). Alcohol and drug use are infrequent. Collectively, these objective and behavioral markers indicate preserved circadian rhythm, regular sleep timing, social exercise engagement, and physiological signs of recovery—features that tend to be associated with lower CES-D scores.

Integration and holistic interpretation relative to the study population:
The data present a mixed but interpretable pattern. Self-report indices that are strongly and directly related to depressive symptoms (high trait anxiety, markedly disturbed subjective sleep, reduced self-esteem, and low self-reported happiness) provide robust evidence pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms relative to peers. In contrast, multiple objective wearable measures and behavioral markers (regular sleep duration and timing, clear circadian amplitude and stability, low resting heart rate, and frequent group exercise) are protective and argue against very severe or highly disabling depressive symptoms. Given the relative strength of the self-report signals (notably the high STAI and PSQI z-scores and their strong correlations with CES-D in the sample) combined with protective but less strongly CES-D–correlated objective features, the overall balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.25). The pattern suggests a moderate elevation in depressive symptoms rather than an extreme divergence: strong subjective distress and sleep complaints coexist with preserved objective daily structure and some social/behavioral resources.

Uncertainty and caveats:
This inference integrates measures with differing predictive power: several self-report scores have strong sample correlations with CES-D and are elevated, whereas many wearable features have smaller correlations with CES-D and are comparatively normative or protective for this participant. Because no direct CES-D item score for the participant is provided here, the conclusion is probabilistic and should be interpreted as an informed estimate rather than a diagnostic statement. If clinical decision-making is contemplated, direct CES-D assessment or clinical interview would be needed to confirm symptom severity and functional impact."
23576,"Summary and overall inference
Based on the pattern of self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological data, the participant shows more evidence consistent with lower-than-average depressive symptom burden relative to the study sample. Using the study sample CES-D population mean (13.32; median 11.5, 75th percentile 18.0) and the available correlational anchors, the preponderance of protective indicators (notably low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem, regular and adequate sleep, frequent exercise, little substance use, and generally stable circadian structure) suggests the participant’s CES‑D score is likely below the population mean. This inference is of moderate confidence given the absence of a directly reported CES‑D score and the fact that some small-to-moderate risk signals are also present.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Anxiety and self‑esteem: The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72) is well below the sample mean and STAI has a strong positive correlation (r = 0.81) with CES‑D in this dataset; lower trait anxiety therefore strongly favors lower CES‑D. Likewise, self‑esteem is elevated (RSES Z ≈ 0.96) and self‑esteem correlates negatively and strongly with CES‑D (r = -0.71), another robust protective indicator.  
- Behavioral and lifestyle protections: The participant reports exercising frequently (exercising alone ≥3×/week, Z = 1.07) and effectively no substance use (alcohol and drugs all “not at all,” Z-scores strongly negative). These behaviors tend to relate to lower depressive symptoms in the study correlations provided (exercise correlations small-to-moderate negative; substance use absent). High academic performance (GPA near ceiling) and above‑average health satisfaction (Z ≈ 0.72, correlation with lower CES‑D r ≈ -0.39) are additional supporting factors.  
- Sleep quantity and consistency: Wearable-derived sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of ~7 h 46 min (Z = 0.72) and low night‑to‑night variability in both duration and sleep onset (SD of duration Z = -0.98; sleep start SD Z = -0.83). Regular, adequate sleep duration and low variability are generally associated with lower depressive symptom levels and are reflected here as protective.  
- Circadian and autonomic stability: Circadian metrics indicate a reasonably intact and regular 24‑hour structure (interdaily stability 0.47, Z = 0.5; autocorrelation at 24h Z = 1.06). Intradaily variability is not elevated (Z = 0.24). Resting heart rate and MESOR are slightly below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.07 and -0.35, respectively); given only modest positive correlations of heart-rate metrics with CES‑D, these values are not suggestive of elevated depressive symptoms and are more consistent with lower risk.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Subjective sleep quality: The PSQI score is 6.0 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which exceeds the common clinical cutoff (>5) and is indicative of some subjective sleep difficulty despite objectively adequate duration. Sleep disturbance measured subjectively is associated with higher depressive symptoms in many studies and could elevate CES‑D risk here.  
- Current affect and perceived stress: The participant’s current happiness rating is below the sample mean (Z = -0.53) and the PSS perceived stress score is modestly elevated relative to mean (score = 21, Z ≈ -0.17 but with a positive correlation to CES‑D r ≈ 0.28). The negative correlation between happiness and CES‑D (r ≈ -0.46) means lower reported happiness is a meaningful countervailing indicator.  
- Minor behavioral risk markers: Time spent on video games and watching TV/videos is above average (video games Z = 1.71; TV/videos Z = 1.28). These sedentary/leisure behaviors show weak positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (small r values), so these factors represent small additional risk signals.

Physiological circadian/heart‑rate pattern interpretation
The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough and daytime elevations centered in the mid‑afternoon, with acrophase at ~4:05 PM—an overall pattern consistent with an intact diurnal physiological rhythm. Circadian summary metrics (moderate interdaily stability, modest intradaily variability, elevated autocorrelation at 24 hours) point to robust day‑to‑day regularity. Because the study correlations between these circadian metrics and CES‑D are near zero or small, these preserved physiological rhythms should be interpreted as neutral-to-protective rather than as risk factors in this case.

Holistic conclusion and limitations
Weighing the strongest, most highly correlated measures (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem) and the substantial behavioral/physiological protections (regular adequate sleep, frequent exercise, no substance use, stable circadian rhythms), the balance of evidence favors a CES‑D score below the study sample mean (i.e., lower depressive symptom levels than average in this sample). However, subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) and reduced self‑reported happiness provide credible countervailing signals that could raise symptom levels somewhat above an otherwise low baseline. These competing signals reduce certainty; thus the conclusion is probabilistic rather than definitive.  

Limitations: this inference is based on cross‑sectional correlations and proxy markers rather than a directly reported CES‑D score; correlations do not imply causation and some measures (e.g., the RSES numeric range anomaly) should be interpreted cautiously. If clinical decision‑making or high‑stakes assessment is required, direct administration of the CES‑D and/or clinical interview is recommended to confirm symptom level and functional impact."
93485,"Summary of protective indicators (patterns associated with lower CES-D): Several converging data streams point toward relatively low depressive symptom burden for this participant. Trait measures show above-average self-esteem (Rosenberg RSES Z = +0.82), and below-average trait anxiety (STAI Z = −0.62); these two survey scores have relatively large correlations with CES‑D in the study sample (RSES r = −0.71; STAI r = +0.81), and therefore provide strong evidence in the direction of fewer depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range on the PSQI (score = 5; Z = −0.80), and wearable-derived sleep duration is near the sample median (median 7 h 1 min; Z = −0.20) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = −0.69). Objective circadian and cardiovascular markers also align with a healthier profile: high circadian amplitude (Z = +1.90) and elevated interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Z ≈ +1.0–1.2) indicate a regular, high-amplitude 24‑hour heart‑rate rhythm, and resting heart rate is low (47.3 bpm; Z = −1.29). In this sample, higher amplitude and greater regularity are weakly associated with lower CES‑D, and lower resting heart rate is weakly associated with lower CES‑D (resting HR r ≈ +0.19 meaning higher HR tends to track with higher CES‑D). The participant’s reported health satisfaction is high (Z = +1.80; r = −0.39), and frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more; Z = +1.07) is also marginally associated with lower depressive symptoms. Taken together, these trait, behavioral, and physiological indicators form a coherent pattern consistent with a CES‑D score below the study sample mean.

Summary of risk indicators (patterns associated with higher CES-D): There are a smaller set of signals that would point toward elevated depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (Z = −0.53; correlation with CES‑D r = −0.46), which, in isolation, is indicative of greater depressive symptomatology. The participant’s median sleep start time is around 00:58 (≈1:00 AM), and although total sleep duration is adequate, late bedtimes and some variability in sleep timing (sleep start time SD ≈ 81 min; correlation with CES‑D modestly positive) can be associated with mood vulnerability in some individuals. Social exercise and structured social sport involvement are low (exercised with others infrequently; sports = not at all), and time spent in certain social or leisure activities is below average; reduced social engagement is a recognized correlate of higher depressive symptoms, although in this dataset those activity measures have weak correlations with CES‑D. Objective intradaily variability in heart rate (IV Z = +0.46) is mildly elevated compared to the sample and has a small negative relationship to CES‑D here, but the effect sizes are small. Overall, the risk indicators are present but modest in magnitude and are less compelling than the protective signals.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean CES‑D: When weighing the relative magnitude and consistency of the available measures, the balance of evidence favors lower-than-average depressive symptomatology. The strongest single contributors to that conclusion are high self‑esteem and low trait anxiety (both strongly correlated with CES‑D in the sample), good subjective sleep quality, regular and high‑amplitude circadian physiology, low resting heart rate, and high health satisfaction. Risk signals (some reduced subjective happiness, later sleep timing, lower social exercise) are present but smaller in magnitude and supported by weaker correlations in this dataset. Therefore, based on the multimodal profile, the participant’s depressive symptom level is most consistent with being below the study sample mean CES‑D score of 13.33.

Uncertainty and limitations: This inference is probabilistic and correlational — it synthesizes multiple indirect indicators rather than a direct CES‑D score for the participant. Several wearable correlations with CES‑D in the sample are small, and behavioral self-reports (e.g., happiness, social engagement) provide mixed signals; thus the conclusion should be interpreted with caution. If a definitive assessment is required, direct administration of the CES‑D or clinical evaluation would be necessary."
62617,"Protective signals from self-report and behavior
The participant’s self-report profile contains multiple, relatively strong indicators associated with lower depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 28, Z = -1.31) is well below the sample mean and the instrument’s correlation with CES-D in this dataset is high (r = 0.81), so the low anxiety score is a robust protective sign. Global self‑worth is also high (Rosenberg self‑esteem Z = +1.24; note the provided score and scale appear inconsistent but the Z-score indicates relatively high self‑esteem), and self‑esteem has a large negative correlation with CES‑D (r = -0.71); this again strongly points away from elevated depressive symptomatology. Current self‑rated happiness (Z = +1.64) and low perceived stress (PSS Z = -1.26) further align with a low symptom profile. Health satisfaction and frequent exercise (exercising alone ≥3×/week, Z = +1.07) are additional behavioral features typically associated with lower depression risk in this sample. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is in the “good sleep” range (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8), and the participant reports relatively little daytime napping; subjectively better sleep quality and consistent exercise are both protective factors here.

Signals that could indicate elevated depressive symptoms
A smaller set of features could be interpreted as potential risk indicators, although their effect sizes and correlations with CES‑D in the study are modest. The wearable-derived mean heart rate (MESOR ≈ 78 bpm, Z = +0.58) and resting heart rate (≈60.6 bpm, Z = +0.29) are modestly elevated relative to the sample mean and both show small positive correlations with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19). Reduced circadian amplitude (Amplitude = 7.67, Z = -1.01) also tends to accompany lower physiological rhythm strength; in this dataset amplitude correlates modestly with CES‑D (r = -0.11), and lower amplitude can be a subtle marker of blunted daily variation that sometimes accompanies depressive symptoms. The participant’s median sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 25 min, Z = +1.53); hypersomnolence or longer sleep can co-occur with some depressive presentations, though in this sample sleep duration has essentially no correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.01), so its predictive value here is limited. Finally, interdaily stability (0.20, Z = -1.73) — a measure of day-to-day regularity — is low, which conceptually could reflect irregular daily structure; however, interdaily stability shows negligible correlation with CES‑D in this dataset (r = -0.01), so its contribution to inferred depressive symptoms is minimal.

Wearable circadian and hourly heart‑rate pattern interpretation
The heart‑rate circadian profile shows a clear daily pattern with troughs during the overnight hours and peaks in the evening (acrophase ≈ 5:03 PM). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderately positive (0.44, Z = +0.98), indicating a relatively consistent 24‑hour rhythm despite low interdaily stability. Intradaily variability is low (0.34, Z = -1.45), suggesting limited fragmentation of activity across the day. Taken together, these metrics suggest an intact, if somewhat lower‑amplitude, circadian rhythm rather than a severely disrupted one. Hourly deviations from the MESOR show expected overnight decreases and daytime/evening increases; a slight tendency toward higher evening heart-rate deviations (6–10 PM) is present but correlations of these hourly deviations with CES‑D are small and inconsistent, so they do not materially alter the overall interpretation.

Holistic assessment and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the most salient and high‑weight indicators (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, high current happiness, low perceived stress, good subjective sleep quality, and regular exercise) converge on a profile that is unlikely to be characterized by elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. Physiological indicators (mildly elevated mean/resting heart rate, lower circadian amplitude, longer median sleep) provide small, circumscribed reasons for caution, but their correlations with CES‑D in the sample are weak-to-moderate and do not outweigh the stronger protective self‑report signals. Therefore, based on the available multimodal evidence, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is most consistent with being below the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.34). This conclusion emphasizes probabilistic inference rather than certainty: objective physiology shows minor deviations that warrant monitoring, but the dominant psychological and behavioral data point toward lower-than-average depressive symptoms.

Uncertainty and limitations
This interpretation should be treated as probabilistic and conditional on the available measures. Correlations provided in the dataset are useful guides but do not determine individual outcomes; some measures (e.g., self‑report happiness, trait anxiety, self‑esteem) have stronger, more interpretable relationships with CES‑D than others (e.g., interdaily stability, many hourly heart‑rate deviations). The absence of an actual CES‑D total score for this participant limits definitive classification. If clinical concerns exist, targeted follow‑up with validated symptom assessment (CES‑D or clinical interview) and continued monitoring of physiological markers would reduce uncertainty."
42137,"Summary of evidence suggesting relatively higher depressive symptoms:
Several self-report indicators that strongly correlate with depressive symptoms in this sample point toward elevated risk. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42, Z = 0.07) is present at a level that is associated with higher CES‑D scores in this sample (STAI–CES‑D correlation = 0.81). Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92), and current self-rated happiness is below the study mean (Happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53); both of these patterns commonly accompany higher depressive symptomatology. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59), a known correlate of greater depressive symptoms; the participant reports disturbed sleep despite objective sleep time near the cohort mean, which can reflect sleep-related distress that amplifies mood symptoms. Behavioral markers that weakly favor higher depressive symptoms include greater time spent in sedentary hobbies (Z = 1.41) and elevated television/video time (Z = 0.64).

Summary of evidence suggesting relatively lower depressive symptoms:
There are multiple protective features in the data that argue against severe depressive symptomatology. Self‑reported self‑esteem is high in absolute terms (Rosenberg = 37 of 40) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D in this study (correlation = -0.71), which is a robust buffer. Objective wearable measures indicate generally healthy cardiovascular baselines (resting heart rate = 50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93; mesor = 62.6 bpm, Z = -1.55), consistent with relatively good fitness or low tonic physiological arousal. The participant reports regular exercise alone (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), a behavioral factor that is weakly protective in this sample. Substance use is minimal (beer and recreational drug use low), which also reduces risk. Interpersonal trust is somewhat above average (Z = 0.83), a social resource that can mitigate depressive symptoms.

Physiological and circadian patterns (interpretation and relevance):
Heart‑rate–derived circadian features show a mixed picture. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.45, Z = 0.33), indicating a modestly regular day‑to‑day structure, but intradaily variability is moderately elevated (0.63, Z = 0.6), suggesting more within‑day fragmentation of physiological state; intradaily variability has a small negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample but elevated fragmentation is often discussed as a risk marker in mood research. Circadian amplitude is reduced (amplitude Z = -0.72) and mesor is low (Z = -1.55); reduced amplitude can be seen with blunted daily physiological rhythms, which is sometimes associated with mood disturbances. Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations show expected overnight troughs and daytime peaks, with pronounced positive deviations in mid‑morning and late‑afternoon (e.g., 9–11am and 4–5pm have large positive Zs), likely reflecting activity or schedule demands rather than mood per se; correlations of these hourly deviations with CES‑D are small in magnitude in this sample.

Sleep behavior: objective vs. subjective discrepancy
Objective sleep duration is near the cohort average (median 7h18m, Z = 0.14) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (SD ~90 minutes), yet subjective sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI = 8). This discrepancy—reasonable objective duration but poor perceived sleep—can be important clinically because subjective sleep disturbance is more strongly linked to mood symptoms than duration alone. Sleep onset is on the later side (median start ~00:31) and variability in sleep start (SD 78 minutes) indicates some irregularity that may contribute to perceived poor sleep and daytime stress.

Holistic conclusion relative to population CES‑D:
Balancing the evidence, the participant exhibits several notable risk indicators for elevated depressive symptoms (marked trait anxiety, elevated perceived stress, poor subjective sleep, lower self-reported happiness) alongside meaningful protective factors (high absolute self‑esteem, frequent exercise, low resting HR, low substance use, above‑average interpersonal trust). Taken together, the pattern most consistently suggests a modestly elevated level of depressive symptoms relative to the study sample mean. In summary: the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is likely above the population mean CES‑D score of 13.3 but not extremely so (i.e., a modest elevation rather than a severe outlier). 

Caveats:
This inference synthesizes cross‑sectional self‑report and aggregated wearable metrics rather than an actual CES‑D score for the individual. Correlations provided in the dataset guided interpretation but are not determinative for any one person. The objective wearable data are aggregated and do not replace clinical assessment; interpretive uncertainty remains, particularly because some protective and risk indicators counterbalance one another."
48013,"Summary statement: Integrating self-report, behavioral habit, and wearable-derived physiological data, the participant shows a pattern of psychological and behavioral features that, on balance, are most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study sample mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.29). Several strong self-report markers that correlate highly with CES-D (notably trait anxiety and low self-esteem), together with disrupted sleep timing and high night-to-night sleep variability and reduced circadian regularity in heart-rate rhythms, point toward elevated depressive symptomatology; these are partially offset by protective behavioral features (regular exercise and some social activity) and otherwise normal resting physiology.

Features that indicate relatively higher depressive symptoms
- High trait anxiety: The participant’s STAI–Trait score is 55 (Z = 1.35) and this measure shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81). Elevated chronic anxiety is therefore one of the most robust indicators in the dataset that the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely elevated relative to peers.  
- Low self-esteem and low current happiness: Rosenberg self-esteem of 28 (Z = -1.43) is substantially below the sample mean and has a strong inverse correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71). Self-reported current happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61; r = -0.46). Together these affective and self-concept markers strongly bias toward higher depressive symptoms.  
- Low interpersonal trust: Trust is very low (score Z = -2.07) and is negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.41), consistent with social-cognitive patterns that often accompany higher depressive symptoms.  
- Perceived stress and disturbed sleep complaints: Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92; r = 0.28), and the PSQI score indicates disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7). Stress and subjective sleep difficulties are both associated with greater CES-D in the sample and strengthen the case for higher depressive symptom burden.  
- Objective sleep irregularity and late timing: Wearable data show a late median sleep onset (01:04:30) with a large sleep onset standard deviation (119 minutes, Z = 0.80) and large night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD = 151 minutes, Z = 1.13; correlation with CES-D = 0.20). Late, inconsistent sleep timing and high variability are behavioral markers associated with elevated depressive symptoms.  
- Reduced circadian regularity and flattened amplitude: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate low interdaily stability (0.23, Z = -1.48) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = -1.54), and amplitude is below the sample mean (Z = -1.08). Lower day-to-day regularity and reduced amplitude of circadian rhythms are patterns commonly observed in individuals with higher depressive symptoms and therefore point toward an elevated CES-D.

Features that indicate relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Frequent physical activity and social exercise: The participant reports exercising alone and with others three times a week or more (exercise Z-scores ~ +1.07 and +1.23), and sporting activity ~1–2 times weekly. These exercise patterns have small negative correlations with CES-D in the sample and represent behavioral protective factors that tend to mitigate depressive symptoms.  
- Low use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs and only modest alcohol use: Substance use is minimal (recreational and non-prescribed drugs: “not at all”), with limited alcohol use (beer 1–2/month; wine/liquor 1–2/week). These patterns are not indicative of substance-related risk and are neutral-to-protective relative to depressive symptom risk in the cohort.  
- Reasonable physical health satisfaction and normative resting physiology: Self-rated physical health satisfaction is slightly above the mean (4.67 on 1–7 scale, Z = 0.30) and resting heart rate is within a typical range (59.3 bpm, Z = 0.14). These features do not suggest physiological elevations associated with depression and modestly counterbalance some psychosocial risk indicators.

Physiological and temporal-pattern synthesis
- Heart rate diurnal pattern: The participant’s mesor is slightly above average (77.46, Z = 0.48) and acrophase at 4:28 PM. Hourly deviations show expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate overnight and larger-than-average morning increases (notably 6–7 AM with a very high Z = 3.5). Overall, resting heart rate and diurnal peaks do not present clear evidence of sustained autonomic hyperarousal; however the circadian measures (low interdaily stability, low 24-hour autocorrelation, and reduced amplitude) indicate reduced regularity and dampened day–night contrast in cardiovascular rhythms, a pattern that has been associated with greater depressive symptom severity.  
- Sleep quantity and naps: Median nightly sleep duration is about 6 h 56 min (Z = -0.31), slightly below the sample mean but not severely short. The more salient wearable sleep findings are late average sleep timing, high night-to-night variability, and subjective reports of disturbed sleep—together these sleep-timing and consistency disruptions are more predictive in this dataset of higher CES-D than small differences in total sleep time alone.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Weighing the relative magnitudes and the sample-level correlations, the strongest and most predictive signals in this participant’s profile are high trait anxiety (STAI), low self-esteem, low happiness, low trust, elevated perceived stress, and disturbed/irregular sleep timing and circadian rhythms. These features have relatively large correlations with CES-D in the sample (notably STAI r = 0.81 and self-esteem r = -0.71) and therefore provide the primary basis for inference. Protective behaviors (regular exercise, modest social activity, normative resting physiology, minimal substance use) are present but, given their smaller predictive correlations, do not fully offset the psychosocial and circadian indicators of risk. Accordingly, the integrated assessment is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the population mean CES-D score (13.29). The pattern suggests a moderate-to-elevated level of depressive symptoms relative to peers rather than an isolated or mild deviation.

If clinical or research follow-up is planned, the data indicate domains to prioritize for assessment: mood and anhedonia, trait anxiety, self-esteem and interpersonal trust, sleep timing/regularity, and perceived stress—these areas show the strongest convergence with elevated CES-D in this participant’s multimodal profile."
14571,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a preponderance of indicators that are typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden, alongside a smaller set of behavioral risk features. Self-report measures point to low trait anxiety (STAI = 20; Z = -2.11), low perceived stress (PSS = 12; Z = -2.62), relatively high self-reported happiness (score = 5.0; Z = 1.64), and comparatively high self-esteem (RSES score reported as 46; Z = 1.1). Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 3; Z = -1.72) and substance use is minimal. Many of these measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the expected directions in the study sample (e.g., STAI and CES-D r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71), which strengthens their relevance for interpreting depressive symptom risk.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms: Several robust protective signals emerge. Low trait anxiety and low perceived stress are both strongly associated with lower CES-D scores in this cohort and the participant’s scores lie well below the sample mean (large negative Z-scores). High self-reported happiness and above-average self-esteem provide further trait-level protection (Z = 1.64 and 1.1, respectively), and these constructs show moderate negative correlations with CES-D in the sample. Sleep quality appears healthy by both subjective (PSQI) and objective indicators: median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 14 m (Z = 0.06) with low night-to-night variability (SD 35 min; Z = -1.48), and the wearable-derived circadian metrics show a very regular rhythm — high interdaily stability (0.70; Z = 2.4), low intradaily variability (0.22; Z = -2.29), and high 24-h autocorrelation (Z = 2.24) — characteristics that are typically linked to lower depressive symptomatology or better mood regulation. Minimal substance use and substantial social time (socializing >4 hours; Z = 2.53) are additional behavioral features that generally align with lower depression risk.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms or behavioral risk: There are several notable behavioral patterns that are more commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant reports essentially no exercise (exercised alone: “not at all,” Z = -1.93) and no organized sports, which removes a commonly protective behavioral buffer; although exercise–CES-D correlations in the sample are modest, physical inactivity is a recognized risk behavior. The participant endorses high sedentary and screen-based leisure (TV, video games, internet, music all “>4 hours” with Z-scores from ~2.0 to 4.7), and these activities show small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (r values up to ~0.26). Interpersonal trust is low (Trust Z = -2.39) and, in this sample, lower trust correlates moderately with higher CES-D (r ≈ -0.42). The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:04), which can be associated with mood vulnerability in some studies even when duration and regularity are adequate. Physiological indicators include a somewhat elevated mesor (mean heart-rate baseline 83.8; Z = 1.35) and small positive correlations between resting heart rate/mesor and CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.2), suggesting a modest relationship between higher baseline cardiovascular activation and depressive symptoms for this cohort.

Wearable circadian and heart-rate patterns — interpretation and weighing of effects: The wearable-derived circadian profile is regular and robust (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, clear daytime peaks with acrophase ~4:51 PM, and a normal nocturnal heart-rate trough). These features are typically protective against depressive symptomatology because they reflect stable behavioral and physiological routines. Hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected strong nocturnal dip and daytime elevations, consistent with normal diurnal cardiovascular patterns; resting HR is within a typical range (62.4 bpm; Z = 0.51). Where wearable signals possibly increase risk (slightly higher mesor and resting HR), their sample correlations with CES-D are modest, so their weight should be considered secondary to the stronger self-report signals (low anxiety/stress, high self-esteem, good subjective sleep).

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the preponderance and magnitude of protective indicators (markedly low trait anxiety and perceived stress, elevated self-esteem and happiness, good subjective and objective sleep, stable circadian rhythms, minimal substance use, and substantial social time) outweigh the behavioral risk signals (no exercise, high sedentary/screen time, late sleep onset, low interpersonal trust, and modestly elevated mesor). Given the pattern and the strength of correlations observed in the study sample, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with a CES-D level below the study population mean (population mean CES-D = 13.34, SD = 9.6). This is a probabilistic inference rather than a diagnostic statement: several behaviors (especially lack of exercise, high sedentary screen time, and low trust) warrant attention because they are modifiable and could shift risk over time despite currently favorable trait and circadian indicators."
69057,"Summary and overall comparison:
Taking the self-report and wearable-derived data together, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s pattern of symptoms and behaviors is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study sample’s mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.31). Key self-report indices that are strongly associated with CES‑D in this sample — trait anxiety (STAI = 53, z = +1.16; r with CES‑D = 0.82), elevated perceived stress (PSS = 26, z = +1.19), reduced self-reported happiness (Current = 3.0, z = −0.53; r = −0.46), and lower self‑esteem (RSES = 35, z = −0.45; r = −0.71) — provide the most compelling evidence driving this inference.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms:
- Psychological self-reports: High trait anxiety and elevated perceived stress (both ~+1 SD above the sample mean) are strongly correlated with CES‑D in this dataset and are reliable markers of increased depressive symptom burden. Lower happiness and modestly reduced self‑esteem further align with higher CES‑D scores in this sample (correlations reported above).
- Sleep and circadian disruption: Objective sleep and circadian indicators show several risk-relevant features. Median nightly sleep duration is short (5 h 35 min; z = −1.99), and median sleep start time is very late (≈02:08), with substantial night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD = 53 minutes; z = −0.66) and sleep duration variability (SD = 122 minutes; z = +0.49). Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7). These sleep deficits and irregular sleep timing are well-established contributors to low mood and are present here.
- Circadian/physiological fragmentation: Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.32, z = −0.74) and intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.60, z = +0.39), indicating less stable and more fragmented day–night rhythms. Aggregated heart-rate patterning shows elevated evening and early-night deviations (notably 5–6 pm and 12–1 am with high z-scores), which may reflect atypical timing of physiological arousal. Several of these circadian and sleep features have modest positive correlations with CES‑D in the study, and combined with the self-report stress/anxiety profile they support an inference of greater depressive symptomatology.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms or protective factors:
- Health behaviors and low substance use: The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three times per week or more; z = +1.07), minimal non-prescribed drug use, and only occasional alcohol use. Regular exercise and low substance use are behaviorally protective and generally associate with lower depressive symptoms (correlations in this dataset are small but in the protective direction).
- Social activity and limited napping: The participant reports some socializing (1–2 hours) and low frequency of naps (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07), both of which, in many contexts, are neutral-to-protective with respect to depressive symptoms. Resting heart rate and MESOR are unusually low (RHR = 43.6 bpm, MESOR = 57.89), which often indicate higher cardiovascular fitness; in this sample these metrics show only small positive correlations with CES‑D and are therefore ambiguous rather than clearly protective or risky.
- Magnitude: many wearable-derived correlations with CES‑D are small, so physiological metrics alone provide weaker evidence compared with the strong self-report signal from anxiety and stress.

Synthesis and caveats:
Weighing all modalities, the strongest, most directly relevant indicators (high trait anxiety, elevated perceived stress, reduced self‑reported happiness, disturbed and short sleep, and circadian irregularity) point toward depressive symptom levels above the study sample mean. Protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use, some social contact) mitigate risk to some extent, but they do not fully counterbalance the combination of high anxiety/stress and pronounced sleep/circadian disruption. Important caveats: no direct CES‑D score for this participant is provided here, so this is an inferential judgment based on correlates and multimodal signals; several physiological markers (e.g., low resting HR) are ambiguous and may reflect fitness rather than pathology; heart-rate values are temporally aggregated and should not be interpreted as event-specific reactivity.  

Clinical/monitoring implications (brief):
Given the constellation of high anxiety and stress plus short, irregular sleep and evening physiological arousal, monitoring depressive symptoms directly and addressing sleep regularity and stress/anxiety (behavioral sleep timing interventions, stress management, and continued promotion of regular exercise and social engagement) would be reasonable next steps."
64232,"High-loading indicators consistent with elevated depressive symptoms in this profile include trait anxiety, perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep, and irregular sleep timing. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 44; z = 0.27) is strongly associated with higher CES‑D in the study sample (r ≈ 0.81), and perceived stress is substantially elevated (PSS = 27; z = 1.47; r ≈ 0.28). Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 8; z = 0.59), and objective sleep timing variability is marked (sleep‑start SD ≈ 150 minutes; z = 1.48; correlation with CES‑D ≈ 0.22). Together, these self‑report and behavioral sleep features — high anxiety, high stress, poor subjective sleep, and highly variable bedtimes — are a coherent set of risk signals that tend to track with higher depressive symptom scores in the sample.

Several wearable-derived physiological and circadian features add convergent evidence for elevated symptom burden. Heart‑rate circadian summary measures show a modestly elevated mesor and resting heart rate (mesor ≈ 77.3, z = 0.46; RHR ≈ 59.4, z = 0.15; both positively correlated with CES‑D at small-to-moderate magnitudes), and interdaily stability of the heart‑rate rhythm is low (value = 0.22; z = −1.56), indicating relatively weak day‑to‑day regularity. Low interdaily stability and greater night‑to‑night sleep‑timing variability are commonly associated with worse mood in group data. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show the expected lowered nocturnal heart rate and daytime elevations; correlations between specific hourly deviations and CES‑D are small, but the overall circadian irregularity and physiological arousal indicators align with other stress and sleep markers suggesting increased risk.

Countervailing evidence that would predict lower depressive symptom scores is also present. The participant reports relatively high self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 37; z = −0.17; r with CES‑D ≈ −0.71), which in this sample is a strong protective correlate of fewer depressive symptoms. Objective sleep duration is relatively long (median ≈ 8:00 h; z = 1.01), and the participant reports a good frequency of sports/exercise (sports frequency z ≈ 1.58; r ≈ −0.15), both of which are typically associated with lower depressive symptom levels. Social activity is moderate (socializing ~1–2 hours daily), health‑satisfaction is near average, and sedentary recreational behaviors are low — these behavioral features are either neutral or modestly protective in relation to CES‑D in the cohort data.

Balancing the evidence: the strongest single predictors in the sample are trait anxiety (very high correlation with CES‑D) and self‑esteem (strong negative correlation). In this case, the participant shows elevated anxiety and stress alongside disturbed sleep timing and weak circadian regularity, but also shows protective uplift from relatively high self‑esteem, adequate sleep duration, and frequent sports participation. On balance — giving weight to the high correlations of anxiety and stress with depressive symptoms and to the objectively irregular sleep/circadian markers — the overall pattern is more consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31, SD = 9.62). This inference should be treated as probabilistic: protective factors present could moderate symptom severity, and the available data do not substitute for a direct CES‑D score or a clinical assessment."
37404,"Protective indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptomatology are prominent in the self-report and behavioral measures. The participant reports high self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 38; Z ≈ -0.03 relative to the sample distribution) and a trait anxiety score in the non‑anxious range (STAI = 35; Z = -0.62); both of these scales have strong correlations with CES‑D in the expected directions (self‑esteem r ≈ -0.71; STAI r ≈ 0.81), which makes them particularly informative. Academic performance is strong (GPAs ≈ 3.75–3.8), exercise frequency is above average (exercising alone three times/week or more; Z = 1.07), recreational substance use is low, and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). Objective sleep duration is near the sample average (median 7 h 9 m; Z = -0.04) and sleep duration variability is lower than average (SD = 66 minutes; Z = -0.78), a pattern that—given the modest positive correlation of sleep variability with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.20)—would tend to be associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Taken together, these trait, activity, and objective‑sleep signals provide converging evidence that the participant is likely to have CES‑D levels at or below the sample average.

There are, however, several signals that point in the opposite direction and could elevate depressive symptom risk. The participant’s subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed on the PSQI (score = 7), indicating perceived sleep problems despite objectively adequate total sleep time; PSQI has a small positive relationship with CES‑D in the sample. Current self‑reported happiness is lower than average (Happy = 3.0; Z = -0.53; corr ≈ -0.46), and perceived stress is moderate (PSS = 21). Circadian/rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show reduced regularity and a blunted diurnal profile: interdaily stability is low (0.22; Z = -1.56), intradaily variability is elevated (0.74; Z = 1.37), and cosinor amplitude is reduced (6.01; Z = -1.54). These rhythm features (lower stability, higher fragmentation, lower amplitude) are commonly associated with mood symptomatology in the literature and could reflect a degree of circadian dysregulation; in this dataset the direct correlations of these specific rhythm metrics with CES‑D are small, so their contribution is suggestive rather than definitive. Resting heart rate is slightly above the sample mean (60.8 bpm; Z = 0.32) and heart rate‑based mesor correlates positively with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), which provides an additional small physiological signal associated with higher symptom levels.

The aggregated hourly heart rate profile and sleep timing provide more granular physiological context: overnight mean deviations from the mesor show the expected large nocturnal reductions in heart rate (minimum deviations around -13 to -16 bpm between ~3–6 AM), and daytime elevations peak in the late afternoon/evening (acrophase ~5:32 PM; elevated deviations ~11–15 bpm in the 6–8 PM window). The overall mesor is near the sample mean (73.04; Z = -0.12) but amplitude is attenuated, consistent with a flatter day–night cardiovascular rhythm. This pattern—normal average heart rate but reduced amplitude and lower day‑to‑day stability—aligns with the circadian irregularity noted above and may correspond to subjective sleep complaints or evening‑shifted behavior (median sleep start ~00:49). Because the heart‑rate correlations with CES‑D in this sample are modest, these physiological observations should be interpreted as contextual signs of circadian alteration rather than strong, standalone predictors of depressive severity.

Holistic inference: weighing the relatively strong protective signals (high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, frequent exercise, normal objective sleep duration, low napping, strong academic functioning) against the more modest risk signals (subjective sleep disturbance, reduced circadian regularity and amplitude, lower current happiness, slightly elevated resting heart rate), the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely below the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.32). That said, the participant may have subclinical or situational features—primarily subjective sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity—that could increase vulnerability to elevated symptoms over time. These inferences are constrained by the absence of a direct CES‑D score in the provided data, the modest effect sizes and correlations for many wearable metrics, and the fact that heart‑rate measures are temporally aggregated; therefore conclusions should be treated as probabilistic rather than diagnostic."
70492,"Self-report indicators that align with elevated depressive symptomatology: the participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76), high perceived stress (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92), and reduced self-esteem (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59). These three scales have strong associations with CES‑D in the study sample (STAI–CES‑D correlation = 0.81; RSES–CES‑D correlation = -0.71; PSS–CES‑D correlation = 0.28), which together provide convergent evidence for a higher level of affective distress than many peers. Subjective sleep quality is also borderline disturbed (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed sleep), and the participant reports relatively low satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = -0.62, correlation with CES‑D = -0.39). Behavioral habits that can be associated with greater depressive symptoms include low frequency of exercise (exercising alone and in groups both infrequent; Zs = -1.18 and -0.17) and a tendency toward sedentary hobbies (sedentary hobby time Z = 1.41). Low self-esteem, elevated anxiety and stress, poor subjective sleep, and low physical health satisfaction are the clearest self-report signals that would be expected to relate to an elevated CES‑D score in this sample.

Wearable-derived physiological and sleep data give a mixed picture. Median nightly sleep duration is within a typical range (7 h 5 min; Z = -0.13), and the participant does not habitually nap (mean daily naps = 0.0; Z = -0.86), which are not strong markers of depression in this dataset. However, sleep timing is very late (median sleep start ≈ 03:03) and highly irregular: sleep start time standard deviation is elevated (138 minutes; Z = 1.21) and night-to-night sleep duration is highly variable (SD = 222 minutes; Z = 2.75). High variability in sleep timing and duration is associated in the literature with mood dysregulation and, in this sample, has a modest positive correlation with CES‑D (sleep variability correlations reported ~0.2). Circadian heart-rate measures indicate overall preserved daily structure (interdaily stability = 0.43, Z = 0.17; intradaily variability = 0.54, Z = -0.04) and a normal acrophase (~5:12 PM), but circadian amplitude and mesor are somewhat lower than average (amplitude Z = -0.44; mesor Z = -0.60). Lower amplitude and blunted daytime–nighttime contrast can sometimes accompany depressive states, though the correlations here are small. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.6 bpm; Z = -0.54), which typically reflects cardiovascular fitness rather than a depression signal; its correlation with CES‑D is small and positive in this sample (0.19), so it is not a strong indicator either way. In sum, wearable data most strongly suggest risk via large sleep timing and duration irregularity rather than grossly reduced total sleep or profoundly abnormal circadian structure.

Features consistent with lower depressive symptom levels or resilience: the participant reports a current happiness rating above average (happy = 4, Z = 0.55; correlation with CES‑D = -0.46), spends substantial time socializing with friends (2–3 hours daily; Z = 0.95), maintains a normative median sleep duration, and has a low resting heart rate and reasonable overall circadian stability. Academic performance (GPA around 3.4 across terms) is within a healthy range, and recreational substance use is not elevated beyond typical student levels (beer 1–2×/week; other drug use minimal). These elements—positive current affect, social engagement, preserved sleep quantity, and functional academic performance—are all factors that, in this dataset, are associated with lower CES‑D scores or with reduced likelihood of severe elevation.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study population mean: weighing the convergent high-risk self-report indicators (notably high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep) together with wearable evidence of marked variability in sleep timing/duration, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s depressive symptom burden is likely above the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.3). Protective signs (current happiness above average, active social time, normative median sleep duration, low resting HR) moderate the overall risk estimate, suggesting a level of symptoms that is above average but not necessarily extreme. Given the strong STAI–CES‑D and RSES–CES‑D correlations in the sample, the profile is most consistent with a moderate elevation in depressive symptoms relative to peers rather than a minimal or severe outlier.

Uncertainty and recommended next steps: this analysis integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregate wearable metrics and cannot substitute for a direct CES‑D score or clinical assessment. Key uncertainties include the absence of the participant’s actual CES‑D total and the possibility that elevated anxiety and sleep irregularity reflect situational academic stressors. If the goal is to clarify clinical need or monitor change, targeted follow-up (administer CES‑D and structured screening, assess sleep timing routines, and evaluate anxiety and self-esteem in more depth) would reduce uncertainty and guide any intervention."
95543,"Protective indicators consistent with relatively low depressive symptom burden
The convergent pattern of self-report and behavioral markers points toward a relatively low level of depressive symptoms. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 23, Z = -1.81) and elevated positive self-evaluations (Rosenberg self‑esteem Z = +1.52), both of which have strong negative correlations with CES‑D in the study sample (self‑esteem r ≈ -0.71; STAI r ≈ +0.81 as a risk marker). Current self‑rated happiness is high (Z = +1.64) and perceived stress is below average (PSS Z ≈ -0.98), again suggesting fewer affective symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 3, Z = -1.72), median nightly sleep duration is adequate (≈7 h 25 min, Z ≈ +0.29), and sleep onset timing is unusually late but regular (median start ≈ 02:25, low start‑time SD Z ≈ -1.08). Objective circadian regularity derived from wearable heart rate data (interdaily stability Z ≈ +1.08 and 24‑hour autocorrelation Z ≈ +1.57) and low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ -0.11) indicate consistent day‑to‑day structure. Engagement in social exercise (exercising with others three times/week, Z ≈ +1.23), minimal substance use, high health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.3), and strong academic performance further align with factors that are typically linked to lower CES‑D scores in the sample.

Indicators that could be interpreted as potential risk or warrant contextual attention
A few objective physiologic and behavioral features are associated with small positive correlations with CES‑D in the study sample and therefore merit consideration as potential risk markers. Resting heart rate and MESOR (resting level from cosinor; RHR = 66.7 bpm, MESOR Z ≈ +1.02 and +1.22, respectively) are modestly positively correlated with CES‑D in the cohort (r ≈ +0.2), which could reflect higher tonic autonomic arousal. The participant’s median sleep onset time is late (≈02:25 AM); while sleep timing is regular, an evening‑shifted schedule can in some contexts be linked to mood vulnerability or social/circadian misalignment. Several hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced evening elevations (largest positive deviations between ~6–9 PM), consistent with an acrophase in the early evening (acrophase ≈ 6:35 PM); these features suggest relatively greater evening physiological activation. Correlations between these specific hourly deviations and CES‑D are generally small and inconsistent in direction, so their contribution is uncertain at the individual level. Finally, small positive correlations exist for variability in sleep timing and sleep‑duration variability (both modestly correlated with CES‑D in the sample), although this participant’s variability measures are below or near the study mean.

Synthesis and overall comparison to the study sample
Weighing the available multi‑modal evidence, the balance strongly favors an interpretation of relatively low depressive symptom burden for this participant. Multiple robust protective signals (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, elevated current happiness, good subjective sleep quality, consistent sleep timing, high interdaily stability of physiological rhythms, social exercise, and low substance use) outweigh the limited and modest physiological risk signals (somewhat higher resting MESOR/RHR and an evening‑shifted activity/arousal pattern). Against the study population distribution (mean CES‑D = 13.34, SD = 9.6; median = 11.5), the participant’s profile is best characterized as below the population mean for depressive symptoms. This conclusion is probabilistic and based on patterns and correlations in the sample rather than a direct CES‑D score; it does not constitute a clinical diagnosis. Limitations include reliance on cross‑sectional correlations and aggregated hourly heart‑rate summaries rather than event‑level temporal analyses."
67106,"Summary and overall comparison to sample
The available multimodal data converge to indicate that this participant’s pattern of symptoms and behaviors is more consistent with lower depressive symptom burden than with higher burden in this sample. Using the study population mean CES-D of 13.34 (SD = 9.6) as a reference, the aggregate profile is most compatible with a CES-D level below the population mean (i.e., lower depressive symptoms relative to the sample average). This judgment is based on multiple, converging protective signals (notably low trait anxiety, elevated self‑esteem, higher self‑reported happiness, strong circadian regularity and organized heart‑rate rhythms) that outweigh the modest risk signals (late sleep timing, slightly disturbed subjective sleep, low exercise and low socializing).

Evidence pointing toward lower depressive symptom levels
Several strong indicators in the self-report data are associated with reduced depressive symptoms in this sample. Trait anxiety (STAI = 29, z = -1.22) is substantially below the sample mean; given the strong positive correlation of STAI with CES‑D in this dataset (r = 0.81), a low STAI score is a potent protective factor. Self‑esteem is elevated (RSES z = 1.10) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = -0.71), which further supports lower expected depressive symptoms. The participant reports relatively high current happiness (score = 5.0, z = 1.64) and high health satisfaction (z = 1.47); both correlate negatively with CES‑D in the dataset and therefore reinforce the inference of lower depressive symptomatology. Physiologically, wearable-derived circadian measures show good regularity—high interdaily stability (0.64, z = 1.9) and high autocorrelation at 24 hours (z = 2.07), with relatively low intradaily variability (z = -0.53)—indicating a structured, regular daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is relatively low-normal (56.3 bpm, z = -0.22) and the cosinor-derived amplitude is moderately robust; together these patterns of organized autonomic activity are commonly associated with better mood functioning or lower symptom severity in population studies.

Evidence pointing toward higher depressive symptom levels or potential vulnerabilities
There are a few features that could modestly elevate risk for depressive symptoms or warrant further attention. Subjective sleep quality crosses the common clinical threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6; classification “Disturbed Sleep”), and objective sleep timing shows a late median sleep start (~01:29) with a median duration below 7 hours (6 h 46 m, z = -0.51). These sleep characteristics—late bedtime and somewhat shortened sleep—are known risk factors for mood symptoms, although in this dataset the direct correlations between the specific sleep duration measures and CES‑D are small. The participant reports very low frequency of exercise and very little socializing (socializing z = -2.2; exercise frequencies z approximately -1.1 to -1.6). Although the study-level correlations between these specific activity items and CES‑D are modest (near zero to small), low social interaction and low physical activity are recognized behavioral vulnerabilities that can contribute to worsening mood over time. Substance use is absent (no alcohol or drugs), which reduces one common confound. Overall, these risk signals are present but limited in magnitude compared with the protective signals described above.

Physiological-behavioral synthesis and interpretation
The wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate summary metrics present an organized diurnal profile: pronounced nighttime reductions in heart rate relative to the mesor, clear daytime elevations, a reasonable amplitude, and an acrophase in the late afternoon (approx. 4:20 PM). High interdaily stability and a strong 24‑hour autocorrelation indicate repeatable, consistent daily structure. These physiological signs point toward preserved circadian regulation and autonomic stability, which typically align with lower depressive symptoms. The subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and late sleep timing are notable but do not appear accompanied by fragmented or highly irregular physiological rhythms—sleep variability (SD ~98 min) and intradaily variability (z = -0.53) are not elevated—suggesting the late schedule may reflect lifestyle or chronotype more than an irregular or dysregulated rhythm associated with higher depression in this sample.

Holistic conclusion and caveats
Balancing all data, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a CES‑D level below the study population mean. Strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, elevated happiness, organized circadian physiology, low substance use, and high health satisfaction) outweigh the smaller, plausible risk factors (subjective sleep disturbance, late bedtime, low exercise and limited socializing). Limitations and caveats: no direct CES‑D score for the participant is provided here, effect sizes for some wearable-to-CES‑D correlations are small, and cross-sectional correlations do not prove causation. If clinical monitoring or targeted prevention is of interest, addressing sleep timing/quality and encouraging modest increases in daytime activity and social engagement would be reasonable next steps given the identified vulnerabilities."
83612,"Factors in the profile that align with relatively higher depressive symptom burden: the participant reports pronounced trait anxiety (STAI = 58, Z = +1.65), a variable that in this sample shows a very strong positive association with CES‑D scores (r = 0.82). Low self‑esteem (RSES = 29, Z = −1.29) is another large signal given its strong negative correlation with CES‑D in this cohort (r = −0.71); lower self‑esteem in this participant therefore points toward higher depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is elevated relative to the population mean (PSS = 23, Z = +0.38; r with CES‑D = 0.28), which also tends to co-occur with higher depressive symptoms. Several wearable-derived circadian metrics suggest reduced temporal regularity and greater fragmentation of physiological rhythms—low interdaily stability (0.28, Z = −1.07), elevated intradaily variability (0.70, Z = +1.09), and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.17, Z = −1.29). Although the direct correlations between some of these circadian metrics and CES‑D are small in the sample, such patterns (irregular day‑to‑day rhythms and higher within‑day fragmentation) are commonly observed with elevated mood symptomatology and therefore constitute additional evidence toward a higher CES‑D estimate. Behavioral markers that also trend in the same direction include relatively low socializing (social time Z = −0.62) and no participation in organized sports (Z = −1.09), both of which are plausibly associated with reduced social support and behavioral activation.

Factors in the profile that argue against a pronounced depressive symptom score: subjective sleep quality is reported near the threshold for “good” (PSQI = 5, Z = −0.80), and objective median nightly sleep duration is modest but not severely short (median 6 h 42 min, Z = −0.59). The participant reports very low daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = −0.86), which in this dataset is associated with lower rather than higher CES‑D (population correlation for naps = +0.21). Current self‑reported happiness is above the sample mean (Happy current = 4.0, Z = +0.55) and correlates moderately negatively with CES‑D in the cohort (r = −0.46), which provides a countervailing signal toward lower depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction (Z ≈ 0) and academic performance (GPA consistently high) are also broadly neutral-to-protective features relative to population risk. Substance use is minimal and recreational drug use is absent—behaviors associated with lower concurrent risk in this sample.

Physiological patterning provides a mixed but informative picture. Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly lower than the study mean (resting HR = 54.6 bpm, Z = −0.42; mesor = 70.01, Z = −0.54) and circadian amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude = 9.31, Z = −0.48); blunted amplitude and reduced mesor can be consistent with reduced autonomic responsiveness and are reported in some mood‑disorder literature. Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevations with a peak in the late afternoon (acrophase ~4:23 PM). The participant’s rhythm appears temporally concentrated in daytime activity but with less day‑to‑day stability and higher within‑day fragmentation (see interdaily stability and intradaily variability above), which together suggest physiological rhythm irregularity despite overall preserved nocturnal decline in heart rate.

Holistic inference and comparison to the study population mean CES‑D: synthesizing self‑report, behavioral, and wearable physiological signals yields a mixed but leaning‑toward‑higher profile. The strongest individual indicators—marked trait anxiety (STAI Z = +1.65) and low self‑esteem (RSES Z = −1.29), both of which have strong sample correlations with CES‑D—favor an elevated CES‑D relative to the study average. Several wearable circadian markers (low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, low 24‑hour autocorrelation, and reduced amplitude) provide additional supporting evidence for greater symptom burden, albeit with smaller direct correlations in the cohort. Offsetting signals (PSQI near the “good” threshold, modest sleep duration, higher current happiness, minimal substance use, and strong academic performance) mitigate the strength of that inference but do not fully counterbalance the major risk indicators. On balance, the multimodal evidence is most consistent with an inferred level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.3). This conclusion should be understood as probabilistic: it rests primarily on variables that show strong sample‑level associations with CES‑D (notably trait anxiety and self‑esteem), and the absence of a directly reported participant CES‑D score requires that this inference remain tentative and interpreted in the context of the full clinical picture and any additional self‑report data."
92566,"Summary of psychosocial indicators (features suggesting lower depressive symptom burden):
The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71) and elevated self-regard (Self-Esteem Z = 1.38), both of which have strong correlations with CES-D in the study sample (STAI with a large positive correlation to CES-D, 0.81; self-esteem with a large negative correlation, -0.71). Self-reported current happiness is relatively high (Happy Z = 1.64) and perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS Z = -0.98), while satisfaction with physical health is above average (Health Satisfaction Z = 1.22). Behavioral supports for mood are present: regular solitary exercise (reported “three times a week or more,” Z = 1.07), moderate social time with friends (2–3 hours, Z = 0.95), low recreational drug use, and only modest alcohol use. Collectively these survey and lifestyle indicators point toward psychological resources and behaviors that are associated in this sample with lower CES-D scores.

Evidence that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms:
There are several sleep-related signals that tend to be associated with greater depressive symptoms in the literature and in the present sample. The participant’s PSQI score indicates disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6; commonly interpreted as sleep disturbance), median wearable-recorded sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 17 min, Z = -1.11), and night-to-night sleep timing is variable (sleep start SD ≈ 113 minutes, Z = 0.66). The standard deviation of sleep duration is also elevated (≈120 minutes, Z = 0.43). In this dataset, variability in sleep timing and duration shows positive associations with CES-D (sleep start SD correlation ≈ 0.22; sleep-duration SD correlation ≈ 0.20), suggesting these irregular sleep patterns could modestly increase the likelihood of higher depressive symptoms. Other wearable-derived correlates linked weakly in the sample to higher CES-D include slightly higher resting heart rate values (resting HR correlation ≈ 0.19), though the participant’s resting HR itself is low (49 bpm, Z = -1.08), so this is not a clear risk signal for this individual.

Physiological and circadian rhythm profile (wearable data synthesis):
Heart-rate–based circadian summary metrics are broadly close to the study mean. Interdaily stability (0.40, Z ≈ -0.08) and intradaily variability (0.52, Z ≈ -0.18) indicate a relatively regular and not highly fragmented daily rhythm. Cosinor-derived features show a modest amplitude (Amplitude ≈ 11.06, Z ≈ 0.09) and a mesor slightly below average (Mesor ≈ 71.4, Z ≈ -0.35), with an acrophase around mid-late afternoon (≈ 4:17 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected overnight troughs (substantial negative deviations 2–5 AM) and a primary daytime/early-evening peak (largest positive deviation around 6–7 PM). None of these circadian metrics display strong study-sample correlations with CES-D (most correlations near zero), which suggests that, aside from sleep timing variability noted above, the participant’s circadian structure does not provide strong evidence for elevated depressive symptoms.

Holistic evaluation relative to the study sample mean:
Weighing all available information, the balance of evidence points toward depressive symptom levels below the study population mean. The participant shows multiple strong protective indicators in domains that correlate strongly with CES-D in this sample—particularly low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.71) and high self-esteem (Self-Esteem Z = 1.38), along with high self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64) and health satisfaction (Z = 1.22). Sleep irregularity and subjective sleep disturbance are the most salient risk factors present, but their associations with CES-D in this dataset are modest. Therefore, relative to the study population mean CES-D of 13.33 (SD = 9.61), the participant’s profile is most consistent with a CES-D level below the population mean. 

Caveats and uncertainty:
This inference integrates self-report and wearable-derived measures and relies on correlations observed in the sample; it is not a direct CES-D score and does not substitute for a contemporaneous CES-D assessment. Sleep disturbance and variability remain notable areas of concern because they have plausible mechanistic links to mood; if these worsen or co-occur with increases in perceived stress or anxiety, the participant’s risk could increase. Overall, current data suggest lower-than-average depressive symptoms but warrant monitoring of sleep regularity as a modifiable factor."
35987,"High-risk indicators for elevated depressive symptoms are prominent in this profile. Trait anxiety is well above the study mean (STAI = 51, Z ≈ +0.96) and is a strong positive correlate of CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.82), which substantially increases the likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology. Self-esteem is markedly below the sample mean (Rosenberg = 28, Z ≈ −1.43) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r ≈ −0.71); low self-esteem therefore represents another robust risk factor. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, Z ≈ +0.59) and wearable-recorded short sleep (median 6 h 32 m, Z ≈ −0.81) together indicate both perceived and objective sleep disruption, and poor sleep is commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms. Behavioral markers that often co-occur with depressive states are also present: little or no regular exercise, limited socializing (social time below the sample mean), declines in academic performance across semesters, and low health satisfaction (Z ≈ −0.95). Finally, the wearable-derived pattern of elevated physiological arousal in the late evening and around bedtime—large positive deviations from the heart-rate mesor in the evening/night hours (peak z-scores ≈ +2.2 at 9–12 pm and +1.7 at midnight)—paired with a late median sleep start time (~02:45 AM) suggests an evening-activated physiological profile and delayed sleep timing that can be associated with poorer mood and increased depressive symptoms.

There are, however, several features that temper the interpretation and point toward relative resilience or lower depressive symptom risk. Circadian structure of heart-rate activity appears relatively robust: interdaily stability is high (0.62, Z ≈ +1.74) and amplitude is above average (amplitude Z ≈ +1.16), indicating consistent day-to-day rhythm and pronounced day/night differences in cardiac activity—features that, across the sample, tend to be neutral or modestly associated with lower CES-D (correlations near zero to slightly negative). The participant shows low use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs and only modest alcohol consumption (beer 1–2 times/week), which reduces some behavioral risk exposure. Resting heart rate is slightly below the sample mean (57.2 bpm, Z ≈ −0.11), and sleep timing variability is reasonably low (sleep start SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z ≈ −0.64) with minimal napping; stable scheduling and low napping are generally protective for mood regulation. Self-reported current happiness is modestly above the sample mean (happiness Z ≈ +0.55), which—given its inverse correlation with CES-D (r ≈ −0.46)—is a favorable sign.

Balancing these pieces of evidence, the strongest and most predictive signals point toward increased depressive symptoms: the combination of high trait anxiety (a very strong positive correlate of CES-D), low self-esteem (a very strong negative correlate), disturbed subjective sleep with objectively short and late sleep timing, low social and exercise engagement, and evening physiological arousal. Protective features (robust interdaily stability and amplitude of circadian heart-rate rhythms, low substance use, modestly elevated self-reported happiness) reduce but do not fully offset the magnitude and number of the identified risk factors. In relation to the study population mean CES-D score (mean = 13.32, SD = 9.62), the overall multimodal pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the population mean. This conclusion is probabilistic and based on correlational risk markers in the data; it does not constitute a clinical diagnosis and would benefit from direct CES-D scoring, clinical interview, or follow-up assessment for confirmation."
79341,"Summary and scope
The available self-report and wearable measures present a mixed but overall reassuring pattern with respect to depressive symptomology. No direct CES‑D score for this participant is provided, so the following is an inference drawn from correlated trait measures, lifestyle self-reports, and summary wearable physiology collected across the semester. Where available I note the direction and relative strength of correlations between each metric and CES‑D in the study sample; these correlations are reported to aid interpretation but do not override the holistic assessment.

Features that align with relatively higher depressive symptoms
Several measures point toward features commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms. The participant’s current self‑reported “happy” rating is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61), and this item has a modest negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.46), suggesting lower momentary positive affect that could reflect more depressive affective experience. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:50 AM) and median nightly sleep duration is slightly short (6 h 46 min, Z = -0.51); later and shorter sleep are often linked to increased depressive symptoms in many studies. Some behavioral habits with small positive sample correlations to CES‑D are present at above‑average levels (e.g., video game use, Z = 1.71; listening to music, Z = 0.67), which in this dataset show weak positive associations with higher CES‑D. Finally, some indices of night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 68 min, sleep duration SD = 99 min) show small positive correlations with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.22 and 0.20 respectively), indicating that variability in sleep timing may modestly relate to greater symptom burden for this participant.

Features that align with relatively lower depressive symptoms
A number of robust protective indicators are present. Global self‑esteem is very high (Rosenberg score = 39/40, Z = 0.11) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), which is a substantial protective factor against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is low (PSS = 15, Z = -1.8) and the PSQI score indicates generally good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07) and no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use—both behaviors that, in this dataset, are associated with lower CES‑D or at least not with elevation. Interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are near or slightly better than the cohort mean. Academic performance (GPAs listed) does not point to clear difficulty across terms.

Wearable physiology and circadian structure
Wearable heart‑rate–based circadian metrics indicate a relatively regular and organized physiological rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.52, Z = 0.91) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.44, Z = 0.98) are elevated relative to the study sample, suggesting consistent day‑to‑day timing of physiological activity—an attribute generally associated with lower depression risk or better functioning in circadian research. Intradaily variability is only modest (0.59, Z = 0.32), and amplitude is near sample mean (Z ≈ -0.19). Resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than the cohort mean (RHR = 48.25 bpm, Z = -1.18; MESOR Z = -1.32), and in this dataset higher heart‑rate measures show small positive correlations with CES‑D; thus the participant’s low resting heart rate is consistent with lower depressive symptom risk. Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected deep nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations, with a midday peak; overall the pattern reflects a coherent circadian profile rather than blunted or chaotic rhythms that are often associated with higher depressive symptoms. Correlations between many of these heart‑rate hourly deviations and CES‑D are very small in the sample, so the wearable rhythm evidence should be interpreted as supportive but not definitive.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing risk and protective indicators, the strongest protective signals are high global self‑esteem, low perceived stress, frequent exercise, absence of substance use, and well‑organized circadian physiology. Signals that might increase risk—low momentary happiness, somewhat late and slightly short sleep, and moderate sleep timing variability—are present but generally modest in magnitude and accompanied by stronger protective markers. Given the pattern and the relative effect sizes of the available correlates (notably the strong negative correlation of self‑esteem with CES‑D and the participant’s high self‑esteem), the aggregated evidence supports an inference that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely at or below the study sample mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.32). In other words, the participant’s overall profile is more consistent with CES‑D scores below the sample mean rather than with elevated symptom levels.

Caveats
This is an inference rather than a direct CES‑D measurement: no CES‑D total score for this participant was provided. Correlations reported here are sample associations and are generally small for many physiological metrics; individual variation can differ from population patterns. If clinical or intervention decisions are to be made, direct assessment with a validated depressive symptom measure and, if indicated, a clinical interview are recommended."
83536,"Summary of indicators associated with lower depressive symptom burden:
Multiple robust self-report and physiological features point toward a depressive symptom level below the study population mean. Trait anxiety (STAI) is low (score 26, z = −1.51); this scale has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81), so low trait anxiety here is a substantial protective indicator. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg score reported as 41; z = 0.4) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r = −0.71), another strong protective feature. Concurrent self-reports of current happiness are high (rating = 5, z = 1.64) and health satisfaction is elevated (6/7, z = 1.3), both of which are associated in the sample with lower CES‑D scores. Objective physiological markers that are generally protective include a relatively low resting heart rate (56.4 bpm, z = −0.21) and a mesor near the sample mean (74.23, z ≈ 0), and median nightly sleep duration is near normative (median 7 h 5 min, z = −0.13). Low substance use, absence of napping (mean daily naps = 0, z = −0.86), and moderate socializing and exercise frequencies further align with lower sample-level associations with CES‑D.

Summary of indicators associated with higher depressive symptom burden:
There are several more moderate or circumscribed signals that could be associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality meets the typical threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 6, classified as “disturbed sleep”), which often co-occurs with higher CES‑D (although PSQI z = −0.33 in the sample). The participant’s median sleep start time is late (02:25), and sleep start time shows some variability (SD ≈ 99 minutes, z = 0.35); delayed and irregular sleep timing can be related to mood symptoms even when total sleep time is adequate. Wearable-derived intradaily variability is elevated (value = 0.65, z = 0.74), indicating greater fragmentation of physiological activity across the day; while the sample correlation with CES‑D is small (r ≈ −0.05), elevated intradaily variability is commonly interpreted as reduced consolidation of circadian behavioral patterns and can be relevant for mood. Finally, one behavioral habit — listening to music for more than four hours per day (z = 2.06) — shows a modest positive sample correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.26); this could reflect use of music as an emotion‑regulation strategy or co-occurrence with more time spent alone, but the association is small relative to the strong protective factors above.

Circadian and heart-rate pattern interpretation:
Circadian summary metrics indicate an overall relatively regular rhythm: interdaily stability is at the sample mean (0.41, z = 0.0) and amplitude and mesor are close to average (amplitude z ≈ −0.07; mesor z ≈ 0.04). The acrophase (peak around 5:12 PM) and the aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a robust nocturnal decline and daytime elevations consistent with a typical diurnal profile. The elevated intradaily variability, however, suggests more within-day fragmentation (shorter, more frequent transitions between activity states) despite overall day‑to‑day stability; this pattern could modestly relate to mood regulation even when mean circadian measures are typical.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean:
Weighing all evidence, the balance of indicators favors an inferred CES‑D level below the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.33). The strongest, most diagnostically relevant protective signals are very low trait anxiety (STAI) and high self‑esteem (both strongly correlated with CES‑D in the sample), together with high self‑reported happiness and generally adequate objective sleep duration and low resting heart rate. Risk indicators (disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability, and a few behavioral correlates) are present but moderate in magnitude and do not outweigh the stronger protective markers. Note that this inference is based on cross-sectional associations and aggregated wearable summaries rather than a direct CES‑D score for this individual; associations reported here are sample‑level correlations and do not imply causation. If clinical concern persists (for example because of reported sleep disturbance or late/irregular sleep timing), targeted assessment of depressive symptoms with the CES‑D or clinical interview and attention to sleep timing/quality would be appropriate."
67608,"Summary judgment
Based on the combined self-report and wearable-derived data, the balance of evidence points toward the participant having fewer depressive symptoms than the study sample mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.34). This inference rests primarily on multiple strong protective indicators in the self-report data (notably low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem and momentary happiness) and objectively regular sleep duration. Countervailing signals (subjective sleep disturbance, a late habitual sleep onset and some markers of circadian fragmentation/ evening physiological arousal) raise the possibility of elevated mood‑related risk factors but appear weaker in the present profile than the protective factors. Overall, the participant’s profile is best characterized as below the population mean on depressive symptomatology, while nonetheless containing a few features that warrant monitoring.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
Several self-report measures that correlate with CES‑D in this dataset indicate lower risk. The participant’s STAI–Trait score is 26 (z = −1.51), and STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.81); a low trait anxiety score therefore argues strongly for fewer depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg score with z ≈ 0.96), and self‑esteem shows a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r = −0.71), another robust protective signal. Current self‑reported happiness is elevated (z = 1.64; r with CES‑D = −0.46), and perceived health satisfaction is slightly above average (z ≈ 0.22; r = −0.39), both consistent with lower depressive symptom burden. Behavioral health markers also largely align with a lower‑risk profile: the participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week, z = 1.07) and high academic performance (GPA consistently high), factors commonly associated with better mood and functioning. Objectively measured nocturnal sleep quantity is near the sample median (median sleep duration 7 h 12 min, z = 0.02) and sleep timing is quite stable (sleep start SD z = −1.24), both of which reduce risk compared with more variable or short sleep patterns.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms or risk
There are several features that could predispose to higher depressive symptoms or reflect subclinical distress. The PSQI score is 7 (classified here as “Disturbed Sleep”), which commonly indicates clinically meaningful subjective sleep problems and can be associated with higher CES‑D values; this subjective disturbance contrasts with the adequate median sleep duration and suggests the participant perceives sleep quality problems despite sufficient quantity. Wearable circadian metrics show elevated intradaily variability (value 0.77, z = 1.58), indicating more fragmentation of the day–night heart‑rate pattern; while this metric’s direct correlation with CES‑D in the sample is small (r = −0.05), greater fragmentation is conceptually linked to poorer mood regulation. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:14 AM), and aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced evening elevation (8–9 PM deviation z = 2.32) and an elevated 10–11 PM value (z = 1.49), which together suggest increased evening physiological arousal and a delayed sleep schedule; late timing and evening arousal can be associated with mood disturbance in some individuals. Social behavior indices also show limited social time (socializing with friends reported as 15 minutes or less, z = −2.2), which could reduce social support and increase vulnerability, although the dataset’s correlation between that specific socializing measure and CES‑D is negligible (r = −0.02). Finally, the PSQI and several sleep‑variability metrics have small positive correlations with CES‑D (e.g., sleep start time SD r ≈ 0.21, mean daily naps r ≈ 0.22), so subjective sleep complaints and daytime napping show modest links to higher CES‑D in this sample.

Integrated interpretation and considerations
Taken together, the strongest, most directly relevant signals in this participant’s multimodal profile are protective: low trait anxiety (a variable strongly correlated with CES‑D), above‑average self‑esteem (strong negative correlate), elevated momentary happiness, regular moderate-to-adequate sleep duration, frequent solitary exercise, and high academic functioning. These features collectively indicate a depressive symptom level likely below the study population mean (13.34). Offsetting but weaker concerns include subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), a late but stable sleep phase with evening physiological arousal, elevated intradaily variability of heart rate, and very limited reported time socializing; these could either reflect situational lifestyle factors (e.g., late chronotype, busy academic schedule) or early indicators of mood‑related dysregulation that merit attention. Because several of the higher‑risk signals relate to sleep timing/quality and social engagement rather than to pervasive negative affect or anxiety, they represent potentially modifiable targets (sleep hygiene, social connectedness) for monitoring or intervention.

Practical implication
If the goal is to identify persons at elevated CES‑D risk, this participant would not be prioritized on the basis of the strongest available predictors in the dataset (trait anxiety and self‑esteem). Nonetheless, the combination of subjective sleep disturbance and objective evening arousal/fragmentation suggests that periodic reassessment of mood and sleep, and brief interventions around sleep timing and social engagement, could be clinically useful to prevent worsening."
19735,"Indicators that lean toward higher depressive symptomatology in this case are primarily driven by the self-report trait measures and several behavioral patterns. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z = 0.56) is elevated and this measure has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.82), making it one of the most potent signals here. Self‑esteem is relatively low (RSES = 31; Z = −1.01) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which likewise points toward elevated depressive symptoms. Subjective affect measures are also consistent with this pattern: current happiness is below the sample mean (score = 3.0; Z = −0.53; r = −0.46). The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 6), and sleep‑timing features show a markedly delayed median sleep start (~02:01), with substantial night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep SD = 112 minutes, sleep start SD = 77 minutes); variability in sleep measures has a positive association with CES‑D in the sample (sleep SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.22). Behavioral reports of very limited socializing (socializing with friends: 15 minutes or less; Z = −2.20) and low engagement in shared exercise or sports (Zs −1.58 and −1.09) further align with behavioral withdrawal and reduced social reinforcement, patterns commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms.

By contrast, several objective wearable and health indicators are more consistent with relatively lower depressive symptom load. Nightly sleep duration is objectively adequate and somewhat above the sample average (median 7 h 48 m; Z = 0.77), which is typically protective relative to short sleep. Circadian structure in heart‑rate data is reasonably strong: cardiac rhythm amplitude is elevated (amplitude = 14.29; Z = 1.13) and intradaily variability is slightly lower than the sample mean (IV Z ≈ −0.25), indicating relatively clear day–night separation of physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is comparatively low (50.3 bpm; Z = −0.93), a pattern often associated with greater cardiovascular fitness and—here—shows a small positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.20), implying that the participant’s lower resting HR works against the sample tendency toward higher depression. Aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a normative nocturnal decline and pronounced daytime elevation, consistent with preserved circadian amplitude rather than blunted rhythms sometimes seen in depression.

Weighing the multimodal evidence together suggests a mixed profile with salient psychological risk markers but several objectively resilient physiological patterns. The strongest signals pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms are the trait measures with large effect‑size relationships to CES‑D in the study sample (high STAI, low self‑esteem, lower self‑reported happiness) and behavioral indicators of social withdrawal and disturbed subjective sleep. In contrast, objective sleep duration, robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily fragmentation, and low resting heart rate are relatively protective signals and reduce the likelihood that depressive symptomatology is severe across all domains. Several behavioral risk factors (late and variable sleep timing, minimal social engagement, occasional recreational drug use) add to the risk side despite the favorable physiological profile.

Overall inference relative to the study sample: the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the population mean CES‑D (sample mean = 13.25). This judgment is driven primarily by the participant’s elevated trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, reduced self‑reported happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, and social withdrawal—measures that, in this sample, have the strongest associations with CES‑D. At the same time, objective wearable markers indicate moderate physiological resilience (adequate total sleep, pronounced circadian amplitude, low resting HR), implying a profile of moderate elevation in depressive symptoms rather than extremely high symptom burden. This interpretation is probabilistic and should be integrated with direct CES‑D score data and clinical assessment before drawing firm conclusions."
59207,"Summary of evidence consistent with lower depressive symptomatology:
Several strong or moderately weighted indicators in the self-report and wearable data point toward lower CES‑D scores relative to the study sample. The participant reports relatively high self‑esteem (RSES Z = 0.68) and high overall health satisfaction (Z = 1.30); in this sample these measures show substantial negative correlations with CES‑D (self‑esteem r = −0.71; health satisfaction r = −0.39), which is a robust protective pattern. Habitual physical activity is also above average (exercising alone three times/week or more; exercise Z ≈ 1.07), and exercise shows a weak negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ −0.09), another factor typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. Objective circadian/actigraphy-derived measures indicate a relatively regular and robust daily rhythm: interdaily stability is high (0.56; Z = 1.24) and intradaily variability is low (0.25; Z = −2.08). These rhythm metrics—higher stability and lower fragmentation—are generally interpreted as protective and are not positively associated with CES‑D in this dataset. The cosinor amplitude is above average (14.04; Z = 1.05) and the mesor and resting heart rate are near the group mean (mesor Z = 0.34; resting HR 61.4 bpm Z = 0.39), which together suggest preserved daytime–nighttime physiological contrast rather than the flattened rhythms sometimes seen with higher depressive symptom burden.

Summary of evidence consistent with higher depressive symptomatology:
Other features of the profile point toward factors that commonly co‑occur with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8; classified as disturbed sleep; PSQI Z = 0.59), and in this sample poorer sleep quality relates to higher CES‑D scores. Although median sleep duration is long (8 h 13 min; Z = 1.28), sleep timing is both late (median sleep start ~01:35) and variable (sleep start SD 141 minutes; Z = 1.27) and sleep duration variability is elevated (SD = 169 minutes; Z = 1.55). Later and more irregular sleep timing and greater night‑to‑night variability show small positive correlations with CES‑D in these data (sleep start SD correlation ≈ 0.22; sleep duration SD correlation ≈ 0.20), and subjective poor sleep quality is a common correlate of depressive symptoms. Behavioral indicators such as relatively high time spent on video games (Z = 2.47) and elevated sedentary hobby time (Z ≈ 0.82), while only weakly correlated with CES‑D in this sample, are additional lifestyle features that can accompany or exacerbate low mood for some individuals. Current self‑reported happiness is below the sample mean (Current happiness Z = −0.53; happiness r ≈ −0.46), which aligns with some increase in depressive symptom reporting.

Physiological/temporal pattern interpretation:
The participant’s hourly heart‑rate deviations and circadian parameters indicate a clear nighttime trough and an afternoon/evening peak (acrophase ≈ 5:58 PM) with a larger than typical amplitude (Z = 1.05). This pattern—meaningful day–night contrast and a stable 24‑hour structure (autocorrelation24hr Z ≈ 0.81)—is more consistent with resilient circadian organization than with the blunted or irregular rhythms often associated with higher depression severity. Aggregated hourly deviations show expected nadirs across the early morning hours and higher deviations across the afternoon/evening; correlations between specific hourly deviations and CES‑D are small and mixed, without a clear cardiovascular signature indicating elevated depressive symptomatology.

Balanced integration and overall comparison to the study population mean:
Weighing the evidence, the participant displays several protective markers (high self‑esteem, high health satisfaction, frequent exercise, high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, robust amplitude) that are strongly or moderately associated with lower CES‑D scores in this sample. Countervailing risk signals are primarily sleep‑related (subjective poor sleep, late and variable sleep timing, variable sleep duration) and some sedentary leisure patterns; these are meaningful but, in this profile, appear secondary to the stronger protective factors. On balance, the pattern of multimodal data suggests that this participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely below the study sample mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.32). This inference is probabilistic and moderate in confidence rather than definitive.

Uncertainty and recommended follow‑up:
This integrated interpretation should be considered provisional. The strongest single protective predictor in these data is self‑esteem (large negative association with CES‑D), whereas the most salient risk domain is sleep disturbance (PSQI and variability). If a more definitive assessment of depressive symptoms is desired, direct measurement of CES‑D for this participant (if not already available), clinical interview, and focused assessment of sleep timing/quality would reduce uncertainty. If sleep disturbance is of concern, targeted behavioral sleep interventions or further evaluation of sleep health may be prudent given its known relationship to mood."
96613,"Summary of protective indicators
Multiple converging signals in the self-report and wearable data point toward relatively lower depressive symptomatology compared with the study sample. Trait measures that are strongly associated with lower CES‑D scores are prominent: the participant reports a relatively low trait anxiety score (STAI = 34; Z = -0.72) and an elevated self‑esteem score (RSES Z = 0.96), both of which have large correlations with CES‑D in the sample (STAI r ≈ +0.81; self‑esteem r ≈ -0.71). Physiological markers from the wearable likewise favor a lower symptom level: resting heart rate is low (47.8 bpm, Z = -1.23), and the cosinor amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm is relatively large (Z = +1.26), patterns that are typically associated with better cardiovascular fitness and stronger circadian regulation — characteristics that, in this dataset, tend to go with lower depressive symptoms (amplitude r ≈ -0.10; resting HR r ≈ +0.19, so lower RHR here is protective). The participant also reports high overall health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.05) and engages in group exercise (exercise with others three+ times/week, Z ≈ +1.23) and social activities (socializing ~1–2 hours daily), both likely to mitigate depression risk in this cohort.

Indicators that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms
There are several signals that could point in the opposite direction. Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 6), which is commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms and functional distress; the participant also reports a relatively low current happiness rating (current happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and a modest level of perceived stress (PSS = 22, Z ≈ +0.1), both of which correlate positively with CES‑D in the sample (happy r ≈ -0.46; stress r ≈ +0.28). Behavioral patterns include above‑average time spent on sedentary hobbies (Z ≈ +1.41) and some evening video/TV use, which in this sample weakly relate to higher CES‑D scores. Although exercise is present, the participant reports exercising alone not at all (Z ≈ -1.93) — if social exercise were absent, that would be a risk, but here group exercise is frequent so this is a mixed signal.

Sleep timing and circadian physiology: integration of wearable and subjective sleep
Objective sleep metrics indicate relatively long and stable sleep: median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 29 min, Z = +1.61) with modest night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD Z ≈ -0.53), and sleep start times are late (median start ~01:31 AM) but consistent (start time SD Z ≈ -1.06). Wearable heart‑rate rhythms show a pronounced daytime elevation (large positive deviations in mid‑afternoon; 2–4 PM deviations have high Z scores) and deep overnight HR troughs (large negative deviations in the early morning hours). Overall interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z ≈ +0.33) and intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (Z ≈ +0.67), suggesting a generally regular circadian pattern with modest within‑day fragmentation. These objective patterns (strong amplitude, regular timing, stable sleep duration) are more often associated with lower CES‑D scores in this sample, but the subjective PSQI classification of “disturbed sleep” introduces a discrepancy: the participant is obtaining long, consistent objective sleep while still reporting poorer sleep quality, which can be associated with elevated symptom reporting independent of objective duration.

Synthesis and overall comparison to the study sample
Balancing the strong protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low resting HR, high circadian amplitude, high health satisfaction, frequent group exercise and socializing, objectively long and regular sleep) against the risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, lower self‑reported happiness, modest stress, and some sedentary leisure), the preponderance of evidence favors a depressive symptom level at or below the study sample mean. Relative to the study population mean CES‑D of 13.32 (SD = 9.62), the overall profile most consistently supports a score below the population mean. In other words: while there are specific concerns (notably the participant’s subjective sleep disturbance and reduced momentary happiness) that warrant attention, the aggregate multimodal evidence suggests depressive symptoms that are likely below the average level observed in the cohort."
50766,"Summary
The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of protective behavioral/physiological patterns and some subjective or social features that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Objective wearable signals indicate a robust, regular circadian and activity pattern (high interdaily stability, high autocorrelation at 24 h, large amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm) and normal resting physiology. Self-report trait measures (notably lower-than-average trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem and health satisfaction) point toward lower likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. By contrast, the participant endorses disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7), reports low momentary happiness, and reports very little daily socializing with friends. Taking the balance of evidence together, the pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31), though some individual indicators signal risk or subclinical distress.

Features consistent with relatively higher CES‑D
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The participant’s PSQI score is 7 (classified as disturbed sleep), which is a common correlate of higher CES‑D; subjective sleep problems can amplify mood symptoms even when objective sleep duration is adequate.  
- Low momentary happiness and low interpersonal trust: Current self‑rated happiness is relatively low (Z = -0.53) and trust is slightly below average (Z = -0.46); both of these self‑reports correlate negatively with lower mood in the study sample and therefore lean toward higher depressive symptoms.  
- Late sleep timing and modest sleep timing variability: Median sleep start time is late (around 01:27 AM) and sleep start time standard deviation is modest (54 minutes); later sleep timing and some variability are often linked to mood vulnerability. Mean daily naps are slightly elevated (0.12, Z = 0.61), and in this sample naps were positively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.21).  
- Low reported daily socializing: The participant reports very little time socializing with friends (15 minutes or less; Z = -2.20). Although this item had little direct correlation with CES‑D in the sample, low social engagement is a commonly observed behavioral correlate of depressive symptomatology and therefore represents a potential behavioral risk.

Features consistent with relatively lower CES‑D
- Low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem: Trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43) is below the sample mean and trait anxiety has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81). Self‑esteem shows a positive deviation from the sample (Z = 0.68) and is strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71). These two trait variables are among the strongest protective signals in the data and weigh heavily toward lower depressive symptoms.  
- Regular, high‑amplitude circadian physiology: Wearable circadian metrics show above‑average interdaily stability (0.58, Z = 1.41), high autocorrelation at 24 h (Z = 1.57), and large amplitude (Z = 1.63). These objective indicators reflect consistent day‑to‑day structure and a robust day–night physiological rhythm, patterns that are generally associated with lower depression risk or better mood regulation.  
- Normal objective sleep duration and stable sleep variability: Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 29 min (Z = 0.37) and sleep duration variability is not elevated. Resting heart rate (58.1 bpm, Z ≈ -0.01) is within a healthy range. Together these objective measures do not show the fragmented or shortened sleep that often accompanies higher CES‑D scores.  
- Social/behavioral functioning and academic performance: The participant reports exercising with others frequently (3+ times/week, Z = 1.23) and has high academic performance (GPAs near or above 3.8). Health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.97). These functioning indices and social exercise patterns are typically protective against elevated depressive symptoms.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean
Weighing the strength and direction of the most predictive indicators in this dataset, the participant’s profile is more consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31). The strongest protective evidence comprises low trait anxiety (a variable that correlates highly with CES‑D), higher self‑esteem (also strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D), robust and regular circadian physiology, normal objective sleep duration, and markers of good functioning (exercise with others, strong academic performance, and above‑average health satisfaction). Risk signals—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7), late sleep timing, low momentary happiness, and very limited self‑reported daily socializing—suggest some domains of subclinical distress and warrant attention, but on balance they are outweighed by the protective constellation above.

Limitations
This is an inferential synthesis, not a diagnostic assessment. The dataset provides correlational relationships and population‑relative Z‑scores rather than a direct CES‑D score for the individual; therefore conclusions about “below the mean” are probabilistic and should be interpreted alongside clinical assessment or a direct CES‑D measurement if precise symptom quantification is required."
71089,"Indicators consistent with relatively elevated depressive symptoms
- Several strong self-report signals known to co-occur with higher depressive symptomatology are present. Trait anxiety on the STAI is moderately elevated (score 46, z = 0.46) and this measure has a large positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most informative risk-related features. Self‑esteem is well below the study mean (Rosenberg score 27, z = −1.57) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which also points toward higher depressive symptom burden. Subjective indicators of low health satisfaction (score 2.33, z = −1.45; r with CES‑D = −0.39) and somewhat reduced reported happiness (current 3.0, z = −0.53; r = −0.46) further align with elevated depressive symptoms. Behavioral patterns that weakly but consistently associate with higher CES‑D—minimal exercise (several exercise items have large negative z‑scores indicating relative absence of exercise), higher daily internet and music use (z = 1.52 and 1.60, with positive correlations with CES‑D ~0.25) and a relatively high resting heart rate and mesor (resting HR 71.2 bpm, z = 1.55; mesor 86.93, z = 1.77; correlations ≈ 0.19)—also point in the same direction. Taken together, the strongest contributors to an elevated CES‑D signal here are the combination of elevated trait anxiety and low self‑esteem, supported by physiological arousal (elevated baseline heart rate) and low physical activity.

Indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Several objective behavioral/physiological features and some self-report indices suggest resilience or lower risk. Circadian regularity measures derived from wearable heart rate are relatively robust: interdaily stability (0.57, z = 1.33) and 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.47, z = 1.23) are above the sample mean and intradaily variability is below the mean (0.43, z = −0.81). These patterns indicate a consistent, structured daily rhythm—an element generally associated with better mood regulation and lower depression risk (and here correlations with CES‑D for these metrics are near zero or small). Sleep timing and consistency also appear protective: median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 12 min, z = 1.26), sleep start times are reasonably consistent (median start ~00:50; SD of start time z = −0.96) and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is lower than average (SD 63 min, z = −0.85). The Perceived Stress Scale score is lower than the study mean (PSS 19, z = −0.71), which, while not definitive, suggests less perceived stress relative to peers. These objective regularity and sleep consistency features would typically be expected to mitigate depressive symptoms.

Sleep and circadian synthesis
- The wearable and subjective sleep data present a mixed but largely structured profile. Although the PSQI passes the common cutoff indicating “disturbed sleep” (score = 6), the participant’s objective sleep pattern shows longer-than-average sleep duration, low nightly variability, and a stable sleep schedule. Circadian analysis of heart rate shows an afternoon acrophase (~4:34 PM) and a clear day–night amplitude; amplitude is modestly above average (amplitude z = 0.83) while intradaily variability is low. These combined features indicate preserved circadian organization and consistent sleep habits, which are typically protective for mood even when the participant reports some subjective sleep difficulties.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample
- Balancing the evidence, the profile is mixed but overall leans toward greater depressive symptom burden than the study population mean. The most influential signals favoring an elevated CES‑D score are the high trait anxiety (STAI) and low self‑esteem—two measures with strong sample correlations to CES‑D (±0.71–0.81). Physiological markers of higher baseline autonomic arousal (elevated mesor and resting HR) and behavioral features such as near‑absence of exercise and higher sedentary/internet use add modest additional weight. Offsetting features—strong circadian regularity, consistent and relatively long sleep, and lower perceived stress—reduce but do not fully counterbalance the risk signals. Compared to the study mean CES‑D of 13.3 (SD = 9.62), the pattern of risk and protective factors suggests this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the population mean, though not driven by pervasive sleep fragmentation or extreme physiological dysregulation. Uncertainty remains because some objective markers most strongly tied to symptomatology (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) are self‑report and because several wearable circadian metrics show protective effects; therefore the conclusion is probabilistic rather than definitive."
22688,"Summary conclusion
Based on the combination of self-report trait measures, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological metrics, the participant’s profile contains substantially more signals that historically associate with lower depressive symptom burden than with higher burden. Integrating the strongest, most highly correlated indicators (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, high momentary happiness and good self‑rated health/sleep), the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.33). This conclusion is provisional because no direct CES‑D score for the participant is provided; it rests on the relative weights of the available correlates and their directions of association with CES‑D in the study sample.

Evidence pointing toward lower depressive symptoms
Several robust self‑report indicators are associated with fewer depressive symptoms in this sample. Trait anxiety (STAI = 27; Z = -1.41) is low, and STAI scores in this dataset correlate strongly and positively with CES‑D (r = 0.81), so this is a particularly strong protective signal. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg index reported as high; Z = 1.10; correlation with CES‑D r = -0.71), another large protective factor. Current self‑reported happiness is elevated (score = 5.0, Z = 1.64; correlation r = -0.46), and health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 1.22; r = -0.39). Subjective sleep quality by PSQI is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5.0; Z = -0.8), and objective wearable sleep duration is relatively long and regular (median ~8 h 2 min; Z = 1.05; low night‑to‑night variability Z ≈ -0.51), which together generally align with lower depressive symptom reports in many samples. Social and behavioral supports are also present: the participant reports exercising with others frequently (three times a week or more; Z = 1.23), limited recreational drug use, consistent academic performance (high GPA), and modest daily socializing — all of which are plausibly protective or neutral with respect to CES‑D in this cohort.

Evidence pointing toward higher depressive symptoms or potential risk
A smaller set of observations could be interpreted as modest risk factors or warrant monitoring. Perceived stress (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38) is above the sample mean and correlates positively with CES‑D (r = 0.28), indicating some degree of subjective stress that could elevate symptom burden. Wearable circadian regularity measures show reduced interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours (interdaily stability = 0.27, Z = -1.15; autocorrelation24h Z ≈ -1.79) and a relatively low intradaily variability (Z = -1.80 for intradaily variability), which together indicate modest departures from strong day‑to‑day rhythmic consistency; although correlations with CES‑D are small in this dataset, such circadian irregularity can be associated with mood dysregulation in other work. Resting heart rate is slightly above the sample mean (60.4 bpm; Z = 0.27; r = 0.19), a small positive correlate of CES‑D here. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and liquor ~1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0), which in isolation is only weakly related to CES‑D in the study correlations. Finally, the participant reports little or no solitary exercise (exercised alone: “not at all”; Z = -1.93), so the frequency of social exercise appears to be the primary physical‑activity resource rather than independent exercise habits.

Integrative interpretation and uncertainty
Weighing all domains, the strongest weight of evidence comes from measures with the largest correlations to CES‑D in this sample: low STAI trait anxiety (very strong correlate), high self‑esteem, and high momentary happiness — each pointing away from elevated depressive symptoms. Objective wearable signals (sleep duration and relatively stable nightly timing, circadian amplitude and acrophase within a typical daytime range) generally do not provide strong risk signals; some circadian regularity metrics are lower than average but have small correlations with CES‑D in this dataset, so their contribution to depressive symptom inference is limited. Perceived stress and modest circadian irregularity are the principal counterweights, but their effect sizes and correlations with CES‑D are smaller than the protective indicators listed above.

Final statement relative to the study population mean
Taking the totality of evidence into account, the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is most consistent with being below the study sample’s mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.33). This is an inference, not a direct measurement: it should be treated as probabilistic and interpreted in the context of the absence of the participant’s explicit CES‑D score and the correlational (noncausal) nature of the relationships. If clinical or research decisions depend on an accurate CES‑D value, direct administration of the CES‑D (or equivalent clinical assessment) is recommended."
38815,"Summary synthesis — overall pattern:
The participant presents a mixed multilevel profile in which several behavioral and physiological signals point toward elevated depressive symptom risk while a number of fairly robust protective factors mitigate that risk. Key risk signals include elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and relatively low interpersonal trust (Trust Z = -1.42); these variables have nontrivial empirical associations with CES-D scores in the sample (notably STAI correlates r = 0.81 and Self-Esteem r = -0.71). Countervailing signals include high self-reported self-esteem (RSES = 38, near the sample mean), above-average current happiness (Happy Z = 0.55), good academic performance, regular solo exercise (3+ times/week, Z = 1.07), low substance/drug use, a median nightly sleep duration close to 7 hours, and cardiac indices consistent with good cardiovascular fitness (resting HR = 47.5 bpm, Z = -1.27). Taken together, the profile is most consistent with depressive symptoms that are near the study population mean, with a modest tilt toward higher-than-average symptom burden driven principally by anxiety and sleep disturbance.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher CES-D symptomatology:
- Trait anxiety is the most salient risk indicator. The STAI trait score of 43 (Z ≈ 0.17) is associated very strongly with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81). Even though this absolute STAI z-score is modest, the high correlation makes elevated anxiety a strong predictor of depressive symptoms in this dataset.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classification: “Disturbed Sleep”) is another important risk factor; the PSQI score lies above the commonly used clinical cutoff (>5) and aligns with correlations between disrupted sleep and higher CES-D in the literature. Complementing this, sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 00:50) and sleep duration variability is elevated (SD = 136 minutes, Z = 0.80), and greater night-to-night variability is positively associated with CES-D (sample correlation ≈ 0.20).  
- Social/interpersonal vulnerability: the participant’s trust score (2.5, Z = -1.42) is well below sample mean and correlates negatively with mood/well-being (sample correlation with CES-D ≈ -0.41 for trust-related measures), suggesting lower interpersonal trust may be associated with higher depressive symptoms.  
- Behavioral markers that have small positive correlations with CES-D include relatively high internet use (3–4 hours/day, Z = 1.52) and low frequency of exercising with others (Z = -0.88), both of which may reflect social isolation or more passive coping and are modestly associated with greater depressive symptoms in the sample.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower CES-D symptomatology:
- Self-esteem and momentary positive affect are protective. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem score (38; Z ≈ -0.03) is near the sample mean and shows a strong inverse relation to CES-D in the data (r = -0.71). Current happiness is above average (Happy Z = 0.55), which is associated with lower depressive symptom levels (sample correlation ≈ -0.46). These two psychosocial resources reduce the likelihood of severe depressive symptoms.  
- Behavioral health and functioning are generally favorable: consistent academic performance (GPAs clustered in the mid-high 3.5–3.8 range), frequent solo exercise (3+ times/week), low substance and non-prescribed drug use, minimal time spent watching TV or gaming, and high health satisfaction (Z = 1.05) all point away from substantial depressive impairment.  
- Objective sleep duration and circadian/physiological indices show mixed-to-protective features. Median sleep duration is about 7 hours 3 minutes (Z = -0.16), close to normative sleep length; daytime heart-rate rhythm amplitude is above the sample mean (Amplitude Z = 0.58) and the participant’s large daytime HR peaks (notably mid-to-late afternoon/evening) suggest well-marked diurnal variation rather than a flattened 24-hour pattern. Resting heart rate is low (47.5 bpm, Z = -1.27), likely reflecting fitness and correlates modestly with lower depression risk in this sample (sample correlation for RHR with CES-D ≈ 0.19, meaning higher RHR tends to associate with higher CES-D; the participant’s low RHR therefore points in the opposite direction).

Integration and comparison to population CES-D mean:
Balancing the relative contributions of predictors weighted by their empirical associations in the study, the strongest single predictor available here is trait anxiety (STAI), which increases the probability of higher CES-D. Sleep disturbance and sleep variability provide an additional modest elevation of risk. However, robust protective factors — high self-esteem, above-average momentary happiness, regular exercise, low substance use, stable academic functioning, and physiological markers consistent with fitness and preserved diurnal amplitude — counterbalance those risks. Using the study population context (CES-D mean = 13.31, SD = 9.62), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with a depressive symptom level near the population mean, with a modest bias toward being slightly above the mean rather than far below or far above it. In other words, inferred CES-D symptom burden is “near the mean” but with indicators that warrant monitoring for increases (particularly given trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance).

Caveats:
This is an integrative, inferential assessment based on correlational associations in the sample and multimodal indicators rather than a direct CES-D score for the participant. The strongest weight should be given to measures that show high sample correlations with CES-D (notably STAI and RSES). Temporal aggregation of some wearable metrics limits detection of short-term fluctuations. If clinical or research decisions depend on precise CES-D classification, direct CES-D measurement or clinical assessment should be obtained."
72885,"Summary of indicators consistent with elevated depressive symptoms:
Several self-report and wearable-derived features point toward higher-than-average depressive symptomatology. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46) is elevated and strongly correlated with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most influential single predictors here. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 31; Z = −1.01) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = −0.71), which likewise favors a higher depressive-symptom estimate. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11; Z = 1.98, classified as disturbed sleep), and wearable sleep metrics show a short median nightly sleep duration (5 h 59 min; Z = −1.5) with a very late median sleep onset (~03:44 AM). These sleep features — subjective disturbance, short sleep, and late sleep timing — are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms and nocturnal hyperarousal. Wearable heart-rate data show a pronounced relative elevation at 1–2 AM (mean deviation +6.66 bpm; Z = 2.04), which is consistent with nighttime physiological arousal or fragmentation of rest. Behavioral indices that often co-occur with higher CES-D — limited exercise and social activity, frequent recreational drug use (1–2×/week; Z = 5.44), and low interpersonal trust (Z = −1.42) — are also present and lend convergent support to an elevated symptom inference.

Summary of indicators consistent with lower depressive symptoms:
There are also data elements that temper the inference of severe depressive symptoms. The participant’s current self-reported happiness is above average in the sample (Happy = 4.0; Z = 0.55) and has a moderate negative correlation with CES-D (r = −0.46), which suggests some retention of positive affect. Perceived stress is not markedly elevated relative to the sample (PSS = 21; Z = −0.17), and several circadian/physiological measures do not show strong pathology: resting heart rate is relatively low (54.4 bpm; Z = −0.45) and small positive correlations in this dataset link resting HR to CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), so the participant’s lower resting HR does not push strongly toward higher CES-D. Non-parametric rhythm metrics (intradaily variability and autocorrelation at 24h) are near-sample-average, and some daytime heart-rate elevations in the afternoon/evening indicate preserved daytime activity and physiological responsiveness.

Circadian and physiological profile (integration of wearables with behavior):
The participant’s circadian rhythm features suggest reduced amplitude and some irregularity. Cosinor amplitude is low (Z = −1.0) and interdaily stability is reduced (Z = −1.32), consistent with a weaker, less regular circadian cardiac rhythm across days. The acrophase (~6:38 PM) and the pattern of daytime heart-rate elevations in the afternoon/evening are generally coherent with typical wake-period activity, but the combination of very late sleep onset, short sleep duration, and an elevated heart rate specifically during the 1–2 AM hour points to nocturnal arousal and a delayed sleep schedule. This pattern—late onset, insufficient sleep, nocturnal physiological activation, and reduced rhythm amplitude/stability—matches common behavioral/physiological profiles seen with elevated depressive symptoms and disrupted sleep regulation.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
Weighing the evidence, the balance of high-impact indicators (marked trait anxiety strongly tied to CES-D, low self-esteem with a strong inverse relationship to CES-D, disturbed subjective sleep with objectively short and late sleep timing, nocturnal heart-rate elevation, and behavioral risk factors such as frequent recreational drug use and low social engagement) outweighs the mitigating signs (moderate self-rated happiness, non-elevated perceived stress, and a lower resting heart rate). Taken together, the profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.3). Given the strength of the anxiety and self-esteem signals — both of which show strong sample correlations with CES-D — the participant’s inferred depressive-symptom level is likely meaningfully above the average for this sample rather than only marginally elevated. This inference is probabilistic and subject to uncertainty: it is driven largely by proxy measures and associations rather than a directly reported CES-D score, and some wearable measures show only small correlations with CES-D in this dataset."
71193,"Summary of self-report indicators that point toward elevated depressive symptoms:
The participant’s self-report profile contains several marked signals that, in this sample, are strongly associated with higher CES-D scores. Trait anxiety is notably elevated (STAI = 60, z ≈ +1.85) and this variable shows a very high positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r = 0.81), making it one of the strongest risk markers in the dataset. Self‑esteem is low (RSES = 28, z ≈ −1.43) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which also supports a higher depressive symptom burden. Current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0, z ≈ −1.61; r ≈ −0.45), and perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 25, z ≈ +0.92; r ≈ +0.28); both of these are consistent with greater depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 8, z ≈ +0.59), which typically co-occurs with higher depressive symptom reports. Behavioral self-reports indicate limited socializing and little group exercise, relatively high sedentary hobby time, and minimal organized physical activity — patterns that are commonly associated with higher depressive symptomatology in the literature and in this sample (several activity items show weak-to-moderate correlations in the expected direction).

Wearable and objectively measured features that appear to reduce likelihood of high depressive symptoms:
Objective physiological and rest–activity features from the wearable are generally consistent with relatively healthy circadian organization and preserved daytime activation, features that in this study tend to be neutral or modestly protective with respect to CES‑D. Interdaily stability is high (IS = 0.60, z ≈ +1.57) and 24‑hour autocorrelation is elevated (z ≈ +1.82), pointing to a regular, structured daily rhythm across the recording period. Intradaily variability is relatively low (IV = 0.37, z ≈ −1.24), suggesting low fragmentation of the rhythm. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is long for this sample (median = 8 h 2 m, z ≈ +1.05) and night-to-night variability in duration and start time is low (sleep SD z-scores ≈ −1.04 and −0.93 respectively). These objective markers of consistent and ample sleep, and robust circadian rhythmicity, are generally associated in this dataset with lower or neutral CES‑D levels (correlations for these wearable metrics with CES‑D are small or near zero). Heart-rate–derived daytime activation is pronounced (large positive deviations from mesor across mid‑afternoon hours with high z-scores), which in this sample is weakly associated with lower CES‑D; resting heart rate and overall mesor are near sample mean and not indicative of physiological hyperarousal relevant to depression.

Integration and overall inference relative to the study population mean:
The data present a mixed but interpretable pattern. On balance, the strongest and most CES‑D–predictive signals in the record are the self-report measures: very elevated trait anxiety and meaningfully low self‑esteem (both with large correlations with CES‑D) together with low reported happiness and subjective sleep disturbance argue for a comparatively elevated level of depressive symptoms. In contrast, wearable-derived metrics — stable circadian rhythm, consistent and sufficient sleep duration, low intraday fragmentation, and clear daytime physiological activation — are features that typically offset risk and in this dataset show minimal or small protective associations with CES‑D. Given that the most highly correlated predictors in the dataset (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) point toward higher CES‑D, and that several other self-report indices (happiness, stress, PSQI, low social/exercise engagement) are concordant, the overall pattern is most consistent with a CES‑D score above the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.24). This inference places the participant “above the population mean” for depressive symptoms, with the caveat that objective wearable features reduce but do not eliminate the probability of elevated symptoms.

Limitations and interpretation caveats:
These conclusions weight variables by their within‑sample correlations with CES‑D (e.g., STAI and RSES have particularly strong associations) and thus emphasize self-report indicators. Wearable metrics were temporally aggregated and many show weak correlations with CES‑D in this sample; they are useful for identifying behavioral regularity and sleep sufficiency but are less determinative here. Correlations do not imply causation, and the absence of a direct CES‑D score in the provided record limits precision. If clinical or research decisions depend on an individual’s depression level, obtaining the participant’s CES‑D score or a clinician-administered assessment is recommended to confirm the inference suggested by these converging and diverging signals."
98760,"Summary and overall comparison:
Taken together, the multimodal data indicate a pattern more consistent with lower-than-average depressive symptom burden in this sample. The profile contains several strong protective indicators (notably low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem and momentary happiness) that are among the variables most strongly correlated with CES‑D scores in the study. On balance, and given the relative weights of those measures, the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is below the population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.32).

Features that point toward relatively lower depressive symptoms:
The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 33; Z = −0.82) and comparatively high self‑esteem (RSES Z = +0.82). In the study sample these two scales have some of the largest correlations with CES‑D (STAI r ≈ +0.81; self‑esteem r ≈ −0.71), so the combination of low anxiety and elevated self‑esteem provides strong evidence for fewer depressive symptoms. Current self‑reported happiness is also high (Happiness Z = +1.64; study correlation with CES‑D r ≈ −0.46), which further supports lower symptom levels. Behavioral markers consistent with lower risk include regular physical activity (exercising alone three or more times per week; Z = +1.07) and negligible substance use (alcohol and drugs reported as “not at all,” Zs well below the study mean). Physiologically, a relatively low resting heart rate (53 bpm, Z = −0.61) and a sizable circadian amplitude in heart‑rate rhythm (amplitude Z = +1.64) suggest intact autonomic regulation and a clear daily activity–rest cycle, both of which in this dataset are either weakly or negatively associated with CES‑D.

Features that point toward relatively higher depressive symptoms:
Counterbalancing the protective findings, the participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9; Z = +1.05—classified as “disturbed sleep”) and a consistent late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:58). Sleep duration is modestly below average (median 6 h 52 min; Z = −0.39) and night‑to‑night variability in naps and timing is non‑negligible. In this sample, self‑reported poor sleep quality shows a relationship with higher CES‑D, so subjective sleep disturbance is a salient risk indicator. On the wearable side, intradaily variability (IV Z = +0.88) is somewhat elevated, which can reflect fragmentation of daily rest–activity organization; though its direct correlation with CES‑D is small in this dataset, elevated IV and late sleep timing can be mechanistically linked to mood vulnerability. Social behavior measures show limited socializing (socializing Z = −1.41) and minimal engagement in sedentary hobbies or group sports, which, despite weak correlations here, are behavioral patterns that can co‑occur with elevated depressive symptoms in other research.

Circadian and physiological pattern interpretation:
Heart‑rate circadian metrics indicate a relatively robust daily rhythm (amplitude Z = +1.64, interdaily stability Z = +0.50, autocorrelation24 Z = +0.64) with an acrophase in the early evening (~6:32 PM) and pronounced evening increases in heart rate (peak hourly deviations at 8–9 PM with Z up to +2.9). These findings suggest a clear day‑time activation and consolidated rest overnight (overnight HR deviations are substantially negative relative to the mesor). Such a pronounced amplitude and a low resting heart rate are generally consistent with physiological resilience and, in this sample, tend not to align with higher CES‑D. The elevated intradaily variability and late sleep onset are the primary circadian/behavioral elements that contrast with that resilience and are worth noting as possible contributors to subjective sleep disturbance.

Holistic conclusion:
Weighting the relative strengths and known correlations of available measures, the participant’s data most strongly support an inference of depressive symptoms below the study population mean (i.e., lower-than-average CES‑D). The strongest contributors to that inference are low trait anxiety and higher self‑esteem and happiness, alongside regular exercise and robust heart‑rate amplitude. The main countervailing evidence is disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, and modest daily rhythm fragmentation, which could increase vulnerability to mood symptoms if they worsen. Because sleep complaints are relatively prominent here, they represent a clear target for monitoring or intervention even though the broader profile currently aligns with lower depressive symptom burden."
95374,"Overview: The available self-report and wearable-derived data describe a participant with a late, irregular sleep schedule, relatively high trait anxiety, low momentary happiness, limited reported exercise, but with preserved social contact and minimal substance use. Several behavioral and physiological signals converge on disrupted sleep timing and variability and elevated nighttime physiological activation; other signals (socialization, apparent self-regard, objective sleep quantity, and cardiopulmonary fitness) provide partial countervailing evidence. Taken together, the pattern suggests depressive symptom risk that is modestly elevated relative to the study sample rather than clearly extreme.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher depressive symptoms: Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 47; Z = 0.56) and the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), which is a robust indicator of increased depressive symptomatology. Self-reported current happiness is low (score = 2, Z = -1.61) and correlates negatively with CES-D in the sample (r = -0.46), which aligns with greater depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9; Z = 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep), and objective wearables show a very late median sleep start (03:11) and very high night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep duration SD = 219 minutes, Z = 2.68; sleep start SD Z = 1.43). Both subjective and objective sleep irregularity are associated in the literature with greater depressive symptoms and in this dataset show small positive correlations with CES-D (sleep variability r ≈ 0.18–0.21, naps r = 0.20). The participant reports no regular exercise (exercise frequency Z-scores between -1.09 and -1.93) and has relatively high sedentary leisure (video game time Z = 2.47), behaviors that are associated with higher depressive symptoms in many studies. Wearable hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated evening and late-night heart rate (notably large positive deviations around midnight–1am and 7–8pm) combined with large morning troughs; this pattern together with late sleep timing is consistent with delayed/shifted circadian behavior and possible evening arousal, both of which are linked to affective risk.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower depressive symptoms or protective features: The participant reports appreciable social interaction (socializing with friends 3–4 hours; Z = 1.74), which is commonly protective against depressive symptoms and shows a small negative correlation with CES-D here (r ≈ -0.02). Self-esteem is reported as relatively high in the provided summary (SelfEsteem Z = 0.96); higher self-esteem correlates negatively with CES-D in the sample (r = -0.71). (A caveat: the absolute self-esteem score provided is inconsistent with the usual RSES scaling—this discrepancy warrants caution in interpretation, but the Z-score suggests above-average self-regard relative to the sample.) Objective sleep quantity is not deficient on average (median sleep ≈ 7h15m; Z = 0.09), and the participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (51.4 bpm; Z = -0.8), which can reflect good cardiovascular fitness and is not typically a marker of depressive illness by itself. Circadian rhythm amplitude is high (amplitude Z = 2.06) and 24-hour autocorrelation is above average (Z = 1.06), indicating a relatively strong 24-hour structure in heart-rate rhythms—features that may reflect preserved day–night differentiation and are not strongly associated with higher CES-D in this sample (correlations small or negative).

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, there are several moderate-to-strong risk indicators for elevated depressive symptoms in this participant—most notably elevated trait anxiety, low self-reported happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, very late and highly variable sleep timing, and low reported exercise. Protective elements (above-average social interaction, minimal substance use, apparent higher self-esteem, normal median sleep duration, and low resting heart rate) mitigate but do not entirely offset those risk indicators. Relative to the study sample distribution (population CES-D mean = 13.27, SD = 9.59), the pattern of measures supports an inference of depressive symptom burden that is likely above the population mean or at least modestly elevated compared with the sample average rather than clearly below it. This conclusion is probabilistic: it relies on multiple risk features that are correlated with CES-D in the sample, but there is no direct CES-D score provided here, and several correlations in the wearable domain are small. The inference would be strengthened by an actual CES-D score or longitudinal symptom data.

Limitations and caveats: Inferences are constrained by the absence of the participant’s explicit CES-D value and by some inconsistencies in reported scale ranges (self-esteem). Several wearable-derived circadian metrics correlate weakly with CES-D in this dataset, so their interpretation is cautious. The assessment integrates both subjective reports and objective physiology; where they diverge (normal median sleep duration but disturbed subjective sleep and large variability), the subjective disturbance and variability are prioritized because they more consistently predict affective symptoms."
71985,"Elevating signals (features associated with higher CES‑D): The self-report profile contains several psychological and behavioral features that, given their known correlations with depressive symptoms, point toward elevated risk. Trait anxiety (STAI = 41; classified “anxious”) is a particularly salient finding because STAI scores in this dataset correlate strongly with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81); even a moderate elevation in trait anxiety is therefore a strong indicator of concurrent depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is above the sample mean (PSS = 23, Z ≈ 0.38) and correlates positively with CES‑D, which also favors higher symptom levels. Self‑esteem is modestly below the study mean (RSES = 34; Z ≈ −0.59) and has a strong inverse correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71), so this relative decrement in self‑esteem is another factor that would be expected to co‑occur with higher depressive symptoms. Low satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z ≈ −1.2) and some sedentary/leisure patterns (notably high video‑game use and above‑average internet time, which show small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample) also point in the same direction. Finally, modest instability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes) and greater variability in nightly sleep duration (SD ≈ 108 minutes) are linked in this dataset to higher CES‑D and constitute additional risk‑relevant behavioral features.

Protective signals (features associated with lower CES‑D): Several objective behavioral and physiological indicators are consistent with lower depressive symptoms. Wearable‑derived circadian measures show pronounced regularity and diurnal structure: high interdaily stability (0.66, Z ≈ 2.07), elevated autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z ≈ 1.74), and a relatively large amplitude (Z ≈ 1.01). These features indicate a strong, regular heart‑rate rhythm across days, a pattern that in the study sample is generally associated with lower depressive symptoms or is at least not characteristic of higher CES‑D scores. Sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality are also broadly favorable: median sleep duration ≈ 7 h 18 m (near the sample mean) and a PSQI score at the clinical cutoff (PSQI = 5; classified “Good Sleep” relative to the cohort), both of which argue against substantial sleep‑related contributors to depressive symptoms. Physiologically, a relatively low resting heart rate (50 bpm, Z ≈ −0.97) can reflect good cardiorespiratory fitness or stronger vagal tone and is not aligned with the biological profile typically accompanying higher depressive symptom levels in this sample. Behavioral supports include frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.07), low substance use, and above‑average self‑reported happiness and interpersonal trust (both Z ≈ +0.5), each of which correlate with lower CES‑D in the study data.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the sample mean CES‑D: The dataset presents a mixed but interpretable pattern. The strongest single indicator toward elevated depressive symptoms is trait anxiety (given its very high correlation with CES‑D in this sample), supported by modestly elevated perceived stress and somewhat lower self‑esteem and health satisfaction. Opposing those signals are multiple robust, objective markers of circadian and behavioral health (high interdaily stability and amplitude, adequate sleep duration and quality, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, low substance use, and positive social/trust and happiness ratings). Taken together, these conflicting but concrete signals suggest the participant’s depressive symptom burden is unlikely to be extreme relative to the study cohort. The most defensible summary is that inferred depressive symptom level is near the population mean CES‑D (study mean = 13.31). If forced to characterize directionally, the profile may reflect a modestly increased risk relative to the mean (driven primarily by trait anxiety and stress) but not a large elevation; the overall pattern is consistent with a CES‑D score within approximately one standard deviation of the sample mean (i.e., in the general range around 13.31 ± 9.62), rather than clearly above the 75th percentile.

Key caveats: This synthesis relies on cross‑sectional correlations and aggregated wearable summaries rather than a direct CES‑D score for the participant. The strongest predictive features in this dataset (e.g., STAI and RSES) should be weighted more heavily; objective wearable indicators of strong circadian regularity and adequate sleep, however, are meaningful mitigating signals. For further clarification, concurrent CES‑D measurement or longitudinal follow‑up would allow stronger inference about symptom level and trajectory."
43125,"Summary: The participant’s profile contains a mixture of robust behavioral regularity and several self-reported psychosocial risk factors. Objective wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively strong, regular daily rhythm (elevated amplitude, positive 24-hour autocorrelation, moderate interdaily stability and relatively low intradaily variability), and median nightly sleep duration is within a normal range (~7 h 28 m). In contrast, self-report measures show elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53, z = 1.16), reduced self-esteem (RSES = 33, z = -0.73), and subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 10, z = 1.52). The pattern of substance use (frequent beer and notable recreational drug use) and low social/exercise engagement are additional behavioral features relevant to mood symptoms.

Factors indicating relatively higher depressive symptomatology: Several strong, convergent self-report indicators point toward elevated depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is substantially above the study mean and is highly correlated with CES-D in this sample (STAI correlation with CES-D ≈ 0.81), making it one of the most salient predictors of higher CES-D here. Lower self-esteem is also notably below the sample mean and strongly inversely correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), which likewise supports higher depressive symptom burden. The participant reports clinically significant subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10; z = 1.52), and subjectively poor sleep quality is commonly associated with higher CES-D scores. Behavioral patterns that tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptoms are present: relatively frequent alcohol use and elevated recreational drug use (recreational drugs z = 5.44), minimal exercise and sports engagement, and limited time spent socializing with friends. Self-reported lower happiness (z = -0.53) aligns with these risk indicators. Collectively, these self-reported psychosocial features form a consistent signal that would predict CES-D above the study population mean.

Factors indicating relatively lower depressive symptomatology: Objective wearable physiology and many sleep/behavior regularity measures provide a countervailing signal. Median sleep duration is within a typical range (≈7.5 hours; z = 0.35) and night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is low-to-moderate (sleep start SD and sleep-duration SD both have negative z-scores), suggesting stable sleep quantity even though subjective sleep quality is poor. Circadian measures derived from heart rate are relatively robust: amplitude is elevated (z = 1.36), autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (z = 0.48), and intradaily variability is lower than average (z = -0.39). These features indicate a coherent day–night physiological rhythm and lower fragmentation of activity, which are generally associated with lower depressive symptom severity in population studies. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.8 bpm, z = -0.4), which is not typical of higher sympathetic arousal states and may reflect preserved cardiovascular fitness or lower physiological stress. Aggregate hourly heart rate deviations show expected nocturnal dips and daytime/evening rises rather than an entirely blunted profile; such preserved daily modulation is typically a protective sign relative to severely disordered rhythms.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study mean CES-D: Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most predictive signals point toward elevated depressive symptoms: notably high trait anxiety and low self-esteem (both strongly correlated with CES-D in this sample), together with subjectively poor sleep and behavioral markers such as low social and exercise engagement and substantial substance use. These self-report indicators are more directly tied to CES-D variance in this dataset than most wearable features. Meanwhile, objective wearable metrics (robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability, adequate sleep duration, stable sleep timing) argue against severe or biologically pronounced circadian dysregulation, and therefore temper the likely severity. On balance, the data are most consistent with a CES-D level above the population mean (population mean = 13.24). Given the magnitude of the self-report risk indicators (especially STAI and RSES), the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is best characterized as moderately elevated relative to the sample mean rather than near or below the mean.

Limitations: This inference integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable data and does not substitute for a direct CES-D score or clinical assessment. Correlational relationships in the dataset guide interpretation but do not establish causality. The heart-rate-derived circadian metrics are aggregated across days and cannot identify short-term variability or specific day-level mood–physiology coupling. Finally, subjective and objective sleep measures diverge here (normal objective duration vs. poor subjective quality), and that discrepancy itself is clinically informative but complicates exact severity estimation."
98117,"Summary
The combined self-report and wearable data present a coherent pattern of elevated affective distress and behavioral risk factors alongside a few protective signals. Several high-weight self-report indicators that have strong empirical correlations with depressive symptoms (notably trait anxiety and self-esteem) point toward higher depressive symptomatology; objective wearable signals (marked sleep timing irregularity, reduced circadian amplitude, and a modestly elevated resting heart rate) provide physiological corroboration. Countervailing evidence (absence of substance use, acceptable academic performance, relatively low intraday fragmentation of activity) is present but weaker in magnitude and/or less directly linked to CES-D in this sample. Overall, the profile is most consistent with an inferred CES-D level above the study population mean (population mean CES-D = 13.26).

Factors consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Anxiety-proneness: The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 53, z = 1.16) is well above the sample mean and has a very large positive correlation with CES-D in this study (r = 0.81). High trait anxiety is therefore a strong indicator of elevated depressive symptoms in this individual.  
- Low self-regard and low positive affect: Rosenberg self-esteem is below average (score = 32, z = -0.87) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D (r = -0.71); self-reported current happiness is low (score = 2, z = -1.61, r = -0.46). Both low self-esteem and reduced reported happiness point toward greater depressive symptom burden.  
- Sleep disturbance and circadian misalignment: Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 8, z = 0.59). Wearable sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration below average (~6 h 37 min, z = -0.71) combined with very large night-to-night variability in both sleep timing (sleep start SD = 280 minutes, z = 4.33) and duration (duration SD z = 3.02). The median sleep start time is extremely late (around 04:03), indicating marked circadian delay. These objective sleep irregularities and late timing are plausibly linked to higher depressive symptoms (several of these sleep metrics show positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset).  
- Social withdrawal and low interpersonal trust: Self-report activity shows minimal socializing (≈15 minutes or less; z = -2.20) and very low interpersonal trust (score = 2.17, z = -2.07, r = -0.40). Reduced social engagement and interpersonal trust are consistent with increased depressive symptomatology.  
- Sedentary, high-screen lifestyle: Very high daily internet use (more than 4 hours; z = 2.19, r = 0.24) and substantial passive media consumption correlate positively—albeit modestly—with CES-D in this sample. Lack of reported exercise and sports participation (z-scores strongly negative) also aligns with behavioral risk factors for depression.  
- Physiological arousal pattern: Resting heart rate and MESOR are elevated relative to the study sample (RHR = 66.4 bpm, z = 0.98; MESOR z = 0.96) and these measures show small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19). This combination of elevated baseline cardiovascular tone plus the psychosocial risk profile supports an inference of higher depressive symptoms.

Factors consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms (protective or ambiguous signals)
- Low substance use: The participant reports essentially no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use (z-scores strongly negative). Abstinence from substances removes a common risk correlate for higher CES-D and can be considered protective.  
- Academic functioning: GPA history shows steady improvement across semesters (3.17 → 3.37 → 3.59), indicating functional capacity in academic domains that suggests some preserved psychosocial functioning not typical of severe functional impairment.  
- Low intradaily variability and reasonable interdaily stability: Wearable non-parametric circadian metrics are not strongly disrupted—interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.40, z ≈ -0.08) and intradaily variability is relatively low (0.30, z = -1.73). Low intradaily variability can indicate less fragmentation of activity across the day, which is generally favorable. However, the interpretation is tempered by the very late and highly variable sleep timing—stability at some levels does not negate the pronounced circadian delay/irregularity.  
- Low napping and low daytime sleepiness: Mean daily naps are minimal (0.08/day), which reduces the likelihood that daytime hypersomnia is a dominant feature.

Physiological and circadian synthesis
- Cosinor and hourly heart-rate patterns show a reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude z = -0.42) with an acrophase around early evening (6:27 PM) and a somewhat elevated MESOR. The hourly aggregate deviations reveal expected nocturnal heart rate nadirs but also relatively elevated heart rate in late evening hours. Taken together with the objectively late sleep timing and large variability in sleep onset, the physiological profile suggests circadian misalignment and attenuated rhythm amplitude—patterns that in this dataset and prior literature often accompany higher depressive symptom scores. Non-parametric metrics do not show extreme instability at the day-to-day level, but the very large variation in sleep timing (sleep start SD z = 4.33) is a notable physiological-behavioral risk marker.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Balancing all evidence, the preponderance of stronger and highly correlated indicators (notably high trait anxiety with very large correlation to CES-D, low self-esteem with large negative correlation, low reported happiness, disturbed sleep with extreme variability and late timing, social withdrawal, and elevated resting heart rate) support an overall inference that this participant’s depressive symptom level is above the study population mean (population mean CES-D = 13.26). Protective signals (no substance use, intact academic performance, low napping) are present but are less strongly tied to CES-D in this dataset and do not offset the combination of high-risk psychological, behavioral, and physiological markers.

Limitations
This inference is probabilistic: no direct CES-D total score for the participant was provided here, so the conclusion relies on correlational proxies and multimodal triangulation. Individual heterogeneity and potential situational factors (e.g., academic calendar, exam periods) can affect many reported measures, particularly sleep timing and stress."
24883,"Summary of signals associated with higher depressive symptoms:
Several self-report and wearable features in this profile point toward processes commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology. The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 42; Z ≈ 0.07) — a measure with a strong positive correlation to CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81) — and modestly elevated perceived stress (PSS = 23; Z ≈ 0.38). Subjective sleep quality meets the threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6) and the wearable data show a notably delayed sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:00), which is a clinically and behaviorally salient marker linked to mood disturbance. Wearable circadian metrics likewise indicate reduced circadian structure: a lower amplitude (7.35; Z ≈ -1.11) and reduced interdaily stability (0.29; Z ≈ -0.99). Blunted amplitude and lower stability are commonly observed with greater depressive symptoms in group studies and may reflect dampened daily physiological rhythms. The participant also reports relatively low social engagement and interpersonal trust (socializing Z ≈ -1.41; trust Z ≈ -1.10) and lower momentary happiness (current happy Z ≈ -0.53), which are consistent with psychosocial risk for elevated CES-D. Finally, the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show atypical elevations around late evening/early night hours (notably 12–3 a.m. with high positive deviations from the mesor), which—together with the late sleep onset—suggests nocturnal physiological arousal or circadian misalignment that can accompany sleep disturbance and mood symptoms.

Summary of signals associated with lower depressive symptoms:
There are also several factors in the data that counternbalance the risk indicators. The participant scores high on self-esteem (Rosenberg; Z ≈ 1.52), a variable that is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D in this sample (r = -0.71) and is typically protective against depressive symptoms. Academic functioning is excellent (GPAs ≈ 3.9–4.0), which indicates preserved cognitive/occupational performance and daily functioning. Health behaviors and risk-taking that often amplify mood problems are limited: recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent, alcohol use is only moderate, and the participant reports very little napping and modest overall sleep variability. Resting heart rate and mesor values are lower than the sample mean (RHR ≈ 52 bpm; mesor ≈ 69 bpm), which may reflect good cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline physiological activation; these features are not strongly associated with higher CES-D in the provided correlations. These protective and functioning-related indicators argue against very high levels of depressive impairment.

Physiological and circadian pattern interpretation:
Wearable-derived circadian metrics depict a rhythm with reduced amplitude and lower day-to-day stability, along with a pronounced delay in habitual sleep onset (median start ~03:00) and preserved but somewhat shorter median sleep duration (~6 h 53 m). The combination of delayed sleep timing and elevated late-night heart-rate deviations is consistent with circadian misalignment and nocturnal arousal, both of which are mechanistically linked to disturbed mood and may exacerbate insomnia-like symptoms. However, intradaily variability is relatively low (Z ≈ -1.31), suggesting that, within-day fragmentation of activity is not pronounced. Overall, the physiological picture is one of a temporally shifted and blunted circadian signal rather than highly fragmented or erratic daily behavior.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population:
Balancing the evidence, the profile contains important risk markers for depressive symptoms (notably trait anxiety, disturbed sleep and delayed sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude/stability, greater perceived stress, lower trust/social engagement) but also substantial protective indicators (high self-esteem, strong academic functioning, low substance/drug use, and few behavioral signs of broad functional impairment). Given the mixture of moderate risk and protective factors—and weighting especially the very strong negative association of self-esteem and the very strong positive association of trait anxiety in this sample—the most defensible inference is that this participant’s overall depressive symptom level is near the study population mean CES-D, with the possibility of being modestly above the mean rather than markedly elevated. In the context of the study sample (population CES-D mean = 13.32, SD = 9.62), the data do not point clearly to very high depressive symptom burden but do identify clinically relevant targets (sleep timing and nocturnal arousal, trait anxiety, and social/trust limitations) that could increase risk or maintenance of symptoms.

Caveats:
These inferences integrate correlational guidance and multi-modal markers but do not replace a direct CES-D score or clinical assessment. Correlations provided here indicate associations at the group level and should be interpreted as probabilistic indicators rather than diagnostic criteria."
66815,"Summary and overall comparison:
Taken together, the multimodal profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.31). This inference rests on multiple converging protective indicators (notably high self-reported positive affect and self-esteem, regular sleep duration, low substance use, frequent group exercise, and pronounced circadian amplitude) that typically associate with lower CES‑D scores in this sample. Several risk-relevant features are present but generally modest in magnitude, so the net balance of evidence favors a level of depressive symptoms below the sample mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms:
- Positive self-report indicators show relatively strong protective associations with CES‑D in this sample: self‑esteem is elevated (Z = 0.54) and has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r = −0.71); current happiness is high (Z = 1.64, r = −0.46); and interpersonal trust is elevated (Z = 1.47, r = −0.41). These three axes jointly point toward lower depressive symptomatology.  
- Lifestyle and behavior measures that typically reduce depression risk are present: the participant reports no alcohol or drug use (large negative Z-scores), exercises with others three times per week or more (Z = 1.23, r = −0.23), and reports generally good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = −0.8). Wearable sleep metrics corroborate adequate sleep quantity (median 7 h 6 min, Z = −0.11) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 40 minutes, Z = −1.38), both of which are usually protective.  
- Physiological circadian indicators also point to robust rhythms commonly associated with lower mood symptoms: amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is high (Z = 1.64) and interdaily stability is moderately elevated (Z = 0.83), suggesting a well-structured daily physiological rhythm. The pronounced evening heart-rate elevation (especially 5–6 pm, Z = 4.07) is plausibly explained by regular evening activity/exercise and contributes to a large daily amplitude, which in this sample trends toward lower CES‑D.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms (or cautionary factors):
- Trait anxiety (STAI) is not negligible: the participant’s STAI score is 41 (Z ≈ −0.03) and STAI has the strongest positive correlation with CES‑D in this dataset (r = 0.81). Although the participant’s score is near the study mean rather than high, the strong association means that any increase in chronic anxiety would be expected to track with higher depressive symptoms.  
- Perceived stress is in the moderate range (PSS = 22, Z = 0.1, r = 0.28), which is a modest risk factor for elevated CES‑D.  
- Some circadian/physiological fragmentation signals are slightly elevated: intradaily variability is modestly above the mean (value = 0.60, Z = 0.39) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is below average (Z = −0.78). These features indicate a degree of within-day fragmentation and somewhat reduced day-to-day rhythmic reproducibility, which have small associations with higher CES‑D in this sample.  
- Behavioral social time is relatively low on the time-use survey (socializing 16–30 minutes, Z = −1.41), which could reflect limited casual social contact outside scheduled activities; lower informal social time sometimes relates to higher depressive symptoms, though in this participant the frequent group exercise may offset that risk.

Integrated interpretation and caveats:
Overall, protective signals (high self‑esteem and happiness, regular and sufficient sleep, minimal substance use, frequent group exercise, pronounced circadian amplitude, and low resting heart rate consistent with good fitness) are both individually and collectively strong in the directions associated with lower CES‑D scores in this sample. Risk signals are present but modest: trait anxiety and perceived stress are near-average and physiological rhythm fragmentation is slight. Given the relative magnitudes and the strong negative correlations of the participant’s positive self-reports with CES‑D (particularly self‑esteem, r ≈ −0.71), the most parsimonious interpretation is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is below the study sample mean. Uncertainty remains because STAI is a strong predictor of CES‑D in this dataset; if trait anxiety were to increase or if stressors accumulate, depressive symptoms could shift upward."
89161,"Summary and context
The available self-report and wearable data present a mixed but overall protective profile with respect to depressive symptoms. Several survey scales that are strongly associated with CES‑D scores in this sample point toward lower depressive symptom burden (notably low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem and happiness). Wearable-derived measures indicate generally adequate and regular sleep duration and a relatively low resting heart rate and mesor, consistent with relatively low physiological arousal at rest. However, there are also several behavioral and circadian features (substance use, high intradaily variability, late sleep timing, and isolated late‑evening heart‑rate elevations) that represent countervailing risk factors. Because no direct CES‑D value for this participant is provided, the following interpretation integrates the pattern of indicators and their reported correlations with CES‑D to estimate where this participant likely falls relative to the study sample.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower CES‑D scores
Multiple self‑report indices that correlate robustly with CES‑D point toward fewer depressive symptoms. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02) is substantially below the sample mean; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES‑D in this dataset (r = 0.81), this is a strong protective indicator. Self‑esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 1.52) and has a large negative correlation with CES‑D (r = -0.71), which also favors a lower symptom level. Current self‑reported happiness is high (Z = 1.64, r with CES‑D = -0.46). Perceived stress (PSS = 19) is below the sample mean (Z = -0.71) and overall health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 1.38; r = -0.39). Objective sleep duration is in a healthy range (median 7 h 26 min, Z = 0.32), sleep variability is low (SD 60 min, Z = -0.94), and the PSQI score (5.0, Z = -0.8) is at or below the commonly used cutoff—together these subjective and objective sleep indicators are supportive of lower depressive symptomatology. Resting heart rate and heart‑rate mesor are lower than average (RHR 53.9 bpm, Z = -0.51; mesor Z = -0.86), which can reflect better cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic sympathetic activation and is consistent with the protective pattern above.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher CES‑D scores
There are several notable risk signals. Recreational drug use is an outlying behavioral feature (usage reported 1–2 times per week; Z = 5.44) and is positively correlated with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.18); while the correlation is modest, the magnitude of this behavioral deviation from the sample is large and may increase vulnerability. High daily internet time and extended time listening to music are elevated relative to peers (internet Z = 1.52, music Z = 2.06) and both show small positive correlations with CES‑D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.26), which could reflect compensatory or avoidant behaviors linked to distress. The participant’s sleep midpoint timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:56), and although total sleep time is adequate, late sleep timing has been associated in some literature with mood risk; here it is accompanied by elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.73, Z = 1.30), which indicates more fragmented or irregular activity/rest transitions across the day—IV is often associated with worse mood regulation. Wearable hourly heart‑rate deviations show relatively large positive departures from the mesor in late evening hours (notably 10–11 pm: deviation 16.9, Z = 1.65) and at midday (12–1 pm: deviation 15.6, Z = 1.10), which could reflect evening arousal (late‑night activity, social or substance‑related events) or irregular timing of activities and could contribute to risk even when nightly sleep duration is preserved.

Physiological and circadian interpretation
Circadian summary metrics paint a mixed picture of rhythm structure. Parametric indicators show a lower mesor and modest amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.33) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:38 PM), consistent with a typical diurnal peak in heart rate. Non‑parametric circadian metrics, however, show elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.30) with only modest interdaily stability and low 24‑hour autocorrelation, which together indicate that while the participant’s central tendency and resting physiology are healthy, the day‑to‑day structure and within‑day fragmentation are somewhat pronounced. In practical terms this means the participant tends to have generally healthy resting cardiovascular tone and adequate sleep duration, but their daytime activity and arousal patterns show irregular bursts and variability (including late evening heart‑rate elevations) that could undermine mood regulation over time. The combination of low tonic arousal (low resting HR) and intermittent elevated evening arousal is consistent with a pattern of generally good baseline functioning punctuated by behavioral episodes (e.g., late‑night activities, substance use, intensive internet/social activity) that may transiently increase risk.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean CES‑D
Integrating self‑report and wearable evidence, the balance of indicators favors a depressive symptom level below the study sample mean. Key drivers of this inference are the participant’s notably low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.02, r with CES‑D = 0.81), high self‑esteem (Z = 1.52, r = -0.71), elevated self‑reported happiness (Z = 1.64), generally good subjective sleep quality (PSQI Z = -0.8), and low-to-moderate perceived stress (Z = -0.71). Given the study population mean CES‑D of 13.33 (SD = 9.61), these protective signals make it more likely that the participant’s CES‑D score would fall below the sample mean rather than above it. That said, important countervailing risks—particularly pronounced recreational drug use (Z = 5.44), elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.30), late sleep timing, and elevated late‑evening heart rate peaks—warrant monitoring because they could increase the probability of higher symptoms or episodic worsening despite the generally protective baseline profile.

Uncertainty and monitoring suggestions
This interpretation is probabilistic: correlations and group‑level associations guide inference but do not substitute for a direct CES‑D score or clinical assessment. The strongest protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, high happiness) are robust in this sample and weigh heavily in favor of lower depressive symptoms; conversely, the large deviation in recreational drug use and the circadian fragmentation are clear signals of possible risk. If the objective is ongoing risk management, monitoring substance use, evening activity/arousal patterns, and the stability of sleep timing would be the most targeted priorities given the mixed profile presented here."
14847,"Summary and approach: The available self-report and wearable-derived measures show a mixed profile of behavioral, physiological, and psychological characteristics collected across an academic semester. I focus, in turn, on features that are more consistent with greater depressive symptom burden and features that are more consistent with lower depressive symptom burden, then integrate those lines of evidence and place the participant relative to the study sample mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.28, SD = 9.61).

Features that point toward relatively higher depressive symptom levels
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86) is a strong signal: the STAI score correlates highly with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.81), and so this participant’s above‑average anxiety proneness is a salient risk indicator for higher depressive symptoms.  
- Subjective and objective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 10 (z = 1.52, classified as disturbed sleep) and short median sleep duration (6 h 38 m, z = -0.69) together indicate poor sleep quality and relatively short sleep. Sleep variability is notable (sleep duration SD = 134 min, z = 0.75) and sleep start time is late (median ~02:24) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (start time SD z = 0.46); these sleep characteristics are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms and the sample correlations (sleep variability, nap frequency) are positive. The participant also has a higher-than-average nap rate (mean daily naps 0.24, z = 1.9), which can reflect fragmented nocturnal sleep or compensatory daytime sleepiness.  
- Circadian/physiological rhythm irregularity: intradaily variability is high (IV z = 2.01), indicating fragmentation of within-day heart‑rate patterns; interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are reduced (z’s -0.49 and -0.78), suggesting weaker day‑to‑day regularity. Together, relatively high intraday fragmentation and lower day‑to‑day stability are physiological patterns that have been associated with poorer mood and greater depressive symptoms in population studies.  
- Low interpersonal trust (Trust z = -3.03) and moderately elevated perceived stress (PSS z = 0.65) are psychosocial indicators that are plausibly linked to higher depressive symptoms (trust correlates negatively with CES‑D in the sample, and stress correlates positively).  
- Some behavioral markers that can be interpreted as risk signals: low participation in group exercise/sports (exercising with others = not at all, z = -1.58) and limited engagement in some active hobbies (sports and reading “not at all”) reduce opportunities for social reinforcement and structured activity, which can be associated with higher symptom levels.

Features that point toward relatively lower depressive symptom levels
- Self‑reported current happiness and health satisfaction are above the sample mean (Happy z = 0.55; Health Satisfaction z = 0.97). In the sample these variables correlate negatively with CES‑D, so higher values here are protective signals.  
- Resting physiological measures do not suggest hyperarousal: resting heart rate is low/normal (58.4 bpm, z = 0.03) and the MESOR of the cosinor fit is near the sample mean (MESOR z = 0.10), suggesting no generalized cardiovascular elevation. Evening/overnight aggregated heart‑rate deviations show a normal nocturnal nadir and an evening peak rather than sustained daytime elevation. These heart‑rate features, together with a modest overall amplitude (amplitude z = -0.41), do not provide strong evidence of persistent physiological hyperarousal that sometimes accompanies severe depressive states.  
- Regular individual exercise behavior is present (exercised alone three times a week or more, z = 1.07), and social time with friends is within the higher range for the sample (2–3 hours, z = 0.95). These activity and social-time indicators are commonly linked with lower depressive symptoms or resilience. Alcohol and other substance use are low-frequency, which reduces risk related to substance‑associated mood effects.

Synthesis and overall interpretation
Balancing the evidence, several moderately strong risk signals converge: elevated trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES‑D in the sample), objectively and subjectively disturbed sleep with late and variable bedtimes, high intradaily variability of heart‑rate rhythms, and very low interpersonal trust. Those factors are repeatedly associated with higher depressive symptom burden and are not fully offset by the protective signals. Protective features—above‑average self‑rated happiness and health satisfaction, routine solitary exercise, and a normal resting heart rate—reduce the likelihood of very high CES‑D scores but do not negate the presence of multiple risk factors. The wearable circadian metrics (high IV, reduced stability and autocorrelation, blunted amplitude) point to circadian/behavioral irregularity that is a plausible physiological correlate of mood symptoms and disturbed sleep in this participant.

Conclusion relative to the study population mean CES‑D
Considering the constellation of indicators and the sample correlations provided, the overall profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.28). The combination of elevated anxiety, disturbed and irregular sleep timing, and disrupted circadian heart‑rate patterns are the strongest drivers of this inference; protective features (happiness, health satisfaction, regular solitary exercise, normal resting HR) suggest the elevation is likely moderate rather than extreme. This assessment is probabilistic and based on associations in the available data; it does not constitute a clinical diagnosis and would be strengthened by a direct CES‑D score, additional clinical information, or longitudinal symptom tracking."
43382,"Summary: The multimodal profile shows a mixture of risk-related and protective features for depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) and self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87); both of these self-report measures have strong correlations with CES‑D in the sample (STAI r = +0.82; self‑esteem r = -0.71), making them salient predictors of higher depressive symptom scores. At the same time, the participant reports relatively high current happiness (5, Z = 1.64) and low perceived stress (PSS = 18, Z = -0.98), and reports relatively high satisfaction with physical health (Z = 1.22), which are features associated with lower depressive symptom burden in the sample.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES‑D: The combination of elevated trait anxiety and reduced self‑esteem is the strongest psychological signal that aligns with higher depressive symptoms (large sample correlations noted above). Behavioral markers that typically relate to greater depressive symptoms are also present: low frequency of exercise and sports (exercise Z-scores ≤ -1.58), low socializing (Z ≈ -1.41), and generally limited engagement in daily recreational activities (internet use, video games, sedentary hobbies are low). Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~01:28 AM) and median nightly sleep duration is short (6 h 10 min, Z = -1.27) with substantial night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 120 minutes, Z = 0.44) and start time (SD = 101 minutes, Z = 0.39); these sleep characteristics (late, short, and variable sleep) are commonly associated with elevated mood symptoms and show small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES‑D in the dataset (e.g., sleep variability r ≈ +0.20–0.21). Physiologically, resting heart rate and MESOR are above the sample mean (RHR = 63.4 bpm, Z = 0.62; MESOR = 83.24, Z = 1.27) and have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ +0.19), which can reflect higher tonic physiological arousal linked to greater symptomatology.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES‑D: Several self-report and wearable-derived features point in the opposite direction. The participant’s current happiness rating is substantially above the sample average (Z = 1.64), and perceived stress is lower than average (Z = -0.98); both correlate with CES‑D in the expected directions (happiness r = -0.47; stress r = +0.29), suggesting protective effects against high depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate indicate a generally stable daily structure: autocorrelation at 24 h is elevated (Z = 0.73) and interdaily stability is slightly above average (Z = 0.33), while intradaily variability is lower than average (Z = -0.74). These rhythm features imply a relatively regular heart‑rate circadian pattern across the recording period, which is typically associated with better mood regulation or resilience. The participant also reports low substance use and reasonably good health satisfaction, both of which align with lower depressive symptom likelihood.

Integration and overall comparison to the study sample mean: Balancing the strong psychological risk indicators (notably elevated trait anxiety and lower self‑esteem) against the protective self-reports (higher happiness, lower perceived stress) and the relatively regular circadian physiology yields an intermediate portrait. On net, the profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels near the study population mean, with pockets of elevated risk that could push the participant above the mean under some circumstances. In other words, the participant’s data do not strongly point to very high CES‑D scores but do include several notable risk factors that warrant attention; compared to the sample mean CES‑D = 13.27 (SD = 9.59), the participant is best characterized as near the mean with specific risk features that could increase symptom severity.

Caveats: Correlations included here are sample-level associations and do not deterministically establish individual CES‑D values; the wearable metrics are aggregated summaries and do not replace clinical assessment. The interpretation emphasizes patterns (anxiety and low self‑esteem as risk, happiness and circadian regularity as protective) rather than categorical diagnostic conclusions."
75438,"Summary of psychosocial indicators (evidence favoring lower CES‑D): Several self-report trait measures that are strongly associated with depressive symptoms point toward relatively low symptom burden in this participant. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 36, z = -0.52; classification “not anxious”) is well below the sample mean and is a measure that correlates strongly with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81); this reduction in anxiety-proneness is a relatively high-weight protective signal against elevated depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 33, z = -0.73) and correlates inversely with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), which again constitutes a substantial protective factor. Behavioral and lifestyle markers that typically buffer mood also support a lower CES‑D: regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; z = 1.07), above-average socializing time (2–3 hours, z = 0.95), and relatively high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction z = 0.63) are all consistent with lower depressive symptom levels. Objective cardiovascular markers are also consistent with lower risk: resting heart rate and MESOR are below the sample mean (resting HR = 53 bpm, MESOR = 69.5; z ≈ -0.61), and daytime heart‑rate elevations and a measurable circadian amplitude indicate preserved daytime activity and physiological diurnal structure rather than blunted diurnal signal—features that tend not to accompany more severe depressive presentations in this sample.

Risk indicators (evidence favoring higher CES‑D): There are several, more modest signals suggesting some vulnerability. Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed on the PSQI (score = 6.0, just above the common clinical cutoff), and wearable-derived sleep duration is short (median 6 h 2 min; z = -1.43), with a late median sleep onset (≈01:43). Short sleep duration and disturbed subjective sleep are risk factors for elevated depressive symptoms; although in this dataset the direct statistical correlation between sleep duration and CES‑D is small, sleep disturbance is nevertheless a clinically relevant contributor. Interdaily stability of heart‑rate rhythms is lower than average (interdaily stability = 0.33, z = -0.66), which can reflect weaker day-to-day regularity in activity/rest schedules—another factor that, in other work, relates to mood dysregulation. Additional, smaller signals include reduced self‑reported current happiness (z ≈ -0.53) and relatively low interpersonal trust (trust z = -1.10), both of which have modest correlations with CES‑D in the sample and therefore represent secondary risk contributors. Substance and recreational‑use indicators do not show a clear high-risk pattern (overall usage low to moderate), although one recreational-use z‑score is elevated relative to the sample distribution despite low absolute frequency; this is a low-weight concern in the context of the broader profile.

Interpretation of wearable physiological/circadian metrics in context: The participant’s circadian summary metrics show a preserved diurnal structure. Amplitude is near the sample mean (amplitude z ≈ -0.08), the acrophase is in mid‑afternoon (≈15:28), and hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show clear daytime elevations (notably a pronounced positive deviation across late morning and early afternoon hours, z up to ≈ +2.07), consistent with active daytime physiology. Intradaily variability is relatively low (z ≈ -1.09), suggesting less fragmentation of the heart‑rate signal across the day; lower fragmentation is not a straightforward risk marker here. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (z ≈ +0.31), indicating some regularity in the 24‑hour rhythm. Taken together, these wearable markers are more consistent with preserved circadian and activity structure than with the blunted, dysregulated patterns sometimes reported with higher depressive symptomatology, though the lowered interdaily stability and late sleep timing temper that conclusion.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population mean CES‑D: Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most directly CES‑D‑relevant features (low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem, regular exercise and social engagement, low resting heart rate and preserved daytime physiological activation) point toward a lower level of depressive symptoms than would be expected at the sample mean. Countervailing factors (disturbed subjective sleep, short and late sleep, modestly lower happiness and interpersonal trust, and somewhat reduced interdaily stability) indicate some risk for elevated symptoms but are smaller in magnitude and/or weaker predictors in this dataset. On balance, the multimodal profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.32). In other words, based on the combined self‑report and wearable evidence, this participant is more likely to fall below the average CES‑D score for the study sample rather than near or above it, although sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity represent actionable targets should symptoms change.

Limitations and caveats: This inference relies on cross‑sectional associations and a mixture of subjective and objectively derived measures; individual CES‑D classification would require the participant’s actual CES‑D score and clinical interview for validation. Correlational weights reported in the dataset guided the relative weighting of features, but unmeasured factors or recent situational stressors could alter current symptom levels. The most actionable signals from the data are sleep timing/quality and regularity of daily routines—areas that could be monitored or targeted if mood symptoms were to increase."
99733,"Summary assessment: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant’s pattern of indicators is mixed but leans toward fewer depressive symptoms than the study sample mean. On balance, more of the strongest, theoretically relevant correlates of CES-D are in the direction associated with lower symptom burden (e.g., low trait anxiety, good subjective sleep, lower perceived stress) than in the direction associated with higher symptom burden. Relative to the study sample mean CES-D of 13.33 (SD = 9.61), the profile is most consistent with a CES-D level below the population mean (i.e., fewer depressive symptoms than average), although several signals raise reasons for guarded interpretation.

Evidence pointing toward lower depressive symptoms
- Low trait anxiety and stress: The participant’s STAI–Trait score is 31 (Z = -1.02), classified as “not anxious.” Given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), this low anxiety score is a substantial indicator of lower depressive symptoms. Likewise, perceived stress (PSS = 18; Z = -0.98) is below the sample mean and, although its correlation with CES-D is modest (r = 0.28), it also supports lower symptom burden.  
- Subjective sleep quality and health satisfaction: The PSQI score is 4 (Z = -1.26), in the “good sleep” range; good subjective sleep quality commonly co-occurs with lower depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.55; correlation with CES-D r = -0.39), which further aligns with lower depression-related reporting.  
- Protective lifestyle markers: The participant reports minimal substance use (no beer, wine/liquor, or recreational drugs) and some regular solo exercise (1–2 times/week; Z = 0.32). Interpersonal trust is slightly above average (Z = 0.18; r = -0.41). These behavioral and attitudinal factors are either weakly or moderately associated with lower CES-D scores in the sample and therefore support a below-mean depressive symptom estimate.

Evidence pointing toward higher depressive symptoms or risk
- Lower self-esteem and reduced positive affect: The Rosenberg self-esteem score is 33 (Z = -0.73), which is below the sample mean; self-esteem correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D in this dataset (r = -0.71). This is a relatively robust signal indicating greater depressive symptomatology. Self-reported current happiness is also somewhat below the sample mean (current = 3.0; Z = -0.53) and is moderately inversely correlated with CES-D (r = -0.46), again suggesting more depressive symptoms than would be expected if all other markers were uniformly protective.  
- Circadian and autonomic signals with small-risk implications: Wearable-derived circadian summary metrics are mixed. Intradaily variability (0.70; Z = 1.09) is relatively elevated, indicating more fragmentation of heart-rate rhythmicity across the day; elevated fragmentation has been linked to mood symptoms in prior work, though in this sample its correlation with CES-D is small (r = -0.05). Amplitude is somewhat reduced (9.44; Z = -0.43; r = -0.10), which can indicate blunted day–night autonomic contrast that is sometimes associated with depressive states. Resting heart rate is modestly above the sample mean (62.6 bpm; Z = 0.53) and has a small positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.19), which is consistent with a slight elevation in physiological arousal linked to higher depressive scores.  
- Behavioral sociality: The participant reports relatively low time socializing with friends (16–30 minutes; Z = -1.41). While the sample correlation between that socializing metric and CES-D is small (r = -0.02), reduced social contact can be contextually relevant for mood and interpersonal support.

Integrated interpretation and caveats
- Relative placement: Given the strong protective signal from low STAI (Z = -1.02) and good PSQI (Z = -1.26), plus generally low perceived stress (Z = -0.98) and health satisfaction above average, the preponderance of evidence supports an inferred CES-D level below the study sample mean (i.e., fewer depressive symptoms than average). However, the participant’s lower-than-average self-esteem (Z = -0.73) and mildly reduced positive affect complicate this picture and indicate vulnerability or subthreshold symptoms in domains closely tied to depressive experience. Physiological markers (slightly elevated resting HR, some increase in intradaily variability, reduced amplitude) provide small additional signals consistent with mild risk but are not large in magnitude here.  
- Magnitude and uncertainty: Many wearable–CES-D correlations in this dataset are small, and several behavioral measures (e.g., socializing, exercise) have weak relationships with CES-D in this sample. The strongest single statistical indicators are the STAI–CES-D relationship (r = 0.81) and the self-esteem–CES-D relationship (r = -0.71). Because STAI is low and self-esteem is modestly low, these two high-weight signals pull in opposite directions; the much lower anxiety score appears to dominate the overall inference toward lower depressive symptoms.  
- Practical conclusion: The participant’s multimodal profile is best summarized as overall depressive symptom levels below the sample mean but with specific areas of concern—most notably lower self-esteem and somewhat reduced positive affect—that could merit monitoring or targeted support. Wearable-derived circadian fragmentation and slightly elevated resting heart rate add modest physiological signals consistent with possible vulnerability but are not large enough here to overturn the overall protective pattern.  
- Limitations: This inference is probabilistic and based on cross-sectional associations and aggregated wearable summaries; it does not substitute for a direct CES-D score or a clinical assessment. Correlations reported here reflect sample-level relationships and should be weighted alongside clinical judgment and any additional longitudinal data."
27407,"Summary: The signals in this multimodal dataset are mixed but converge on a modest elevation in depressive symptom risk relative to the study sample. High trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and substantial subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52) are the strongest single indicators associated with higher CES-D in this participant, while relatively intact self-regard (Rosenberg self‑esteem = 36, Z = −0.31) and several objective physiological markers point in the opposite direction. Taken together, the pattern suggests a level of depressive symptoms that is most consistent with being above the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.31), though not unequivocally extreme given countervailing evidence of preserved functioning.

Evidence pointing toward higher depressive symptoms
- Elevated trait anxiety: The STAI score (50, Z = 0.86) has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.82). Elevated anxiety proneness is therefore a major contributor to predicted higher depressive symptoms.  
- Subjective sleep problems: The PSQI score of 10 (Z = 1.52; classified as disturbed sleep) indicates clinically meaningful poor sleep quality. Poor subjective sleep commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptoms and is likely to raise the inferred CES‑D.  
- Sleep timing and variability: Wearable sleep metrics show a late median sleep onset (02:02 AM) and relatively short median nightly sleep (6 h 14 min, Z = −1.17), with moderately elevated night‑to‑night variability in duration (SD ≈ 120 min, Z = 0.43; correlation with CES‑D r ≈ 0.20). Late, short, and inconsistent sleep schedules are behaviorally linked to higher depressive symptomatology and therefore support an inference toward elevated CES‑D.  
- Psychosocial and stress indicators: Moderate perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) and limited social time (socializing Z = −0.62) are both consistent with some increase in depressive symptom risk; the stress–CES‑D correlation is positive in the sample (r ≈ 0.28).  

Evidence pointing toward lower depressive symptoms
- Self‑esteem and self‑reported affect: Rosenberg self‑esteem is relatively preserved (36, Z = −0.31) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which argues for lower depressive symptoms than might be expected from anxiety and sleep alone. Current self‑reported happiness is above the mean (4.0, Z = 0.55) and correlates negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.46), providing additional evidence against severe depressive symptomatology.  
- Objective physiological markers consistent with lower risk: Resting heart rate is low (46.3 bpm, Z = −1.41). In this sample resting HR has a modest positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), so the participant’s low resting HR is more consistent with lower, not higher, depressive symptoms.  
- Functional indicators: Academic performance (multiple high GPAs) and engagement in regular moderate exercise (1–2 times per week, Z ≈ 0.3–0.9) indicate preserved day‑to‑day functioning and behavioral activation, factors that typically predict lower CES‑D scores.

Circadian and wearable physiology synthesis
- Circadian structure appears relatively preserved. Interdaily stability (0.40, Z ≈ −0.08) and intradaily variability (0.51, Z ≈ −0.25) are near the cohort mean and do not strongly point to rhythm fragmentation; amplitude is moderate (12.22, Z = 0.47) and acrophase is in the early evening (≈ 5:46 PM). Heart‑rate hourly deviations show a clear nocturnal trough and pronounced evening elevations (especially 8–9 pm, Z up to 2.25), implying intact day–night separation of autonomic state but with a tendency toward later‑evening physiological activation. Most circadian features here have weak correlations with CES‑D in the sample, so they provide limited evidence either way; the overall pattern suggests preserved circadian organization rather than extreme circadian disruption.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample
- On balance, the strongest, most CES‑D–relevant signals (elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, late and short sleep timing, and modestly elevated perceived stress) collectively point toward an above‑mean level of depressive symptoms compared with the study population (population mean CES‑D = 13.31). This inference is tempered by high self‑esteem, self‑reported happiness, low resting heart rate, regular circadian structure, and evidence of preserved functioning (academic and activity engagement), which reduce the likelihood of a very high CES‑D score.  
- Therefore, the most defensible summary is that this participant’s data are most consistent with depressive symptom levels somewhat above the population mean rather than substantially elevated or minimal; follow‑up assessment using a direct CES‑D score (or clinical interview) and monitoring of sleep and anxiety symptoms would clarify severity and guide potential intervention."
43794,"Elevated internalizing symptoms and subjective distress: Several self-report measures that are strongly associated with depressive symptoms in this sample point toward elevated internal distress for this participant. Trait anxiety (STAI = 55, z = 1.35) is high and has a very strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r = 0.82), and low self‑esteem (RSES = 32, z = -0.87) shows a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71). Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 26, z = 1.19), and current happiness is below average (self-report = 3.0, z = -0.53, corr with CES-D r = -0.46). These convergent self-report indicators — high trait anxiety, reduced self‑esteem, elevated perceived stress, and lower reported happiness — represent some of the most salient signals in the data that would be expected to accompany a CES‑D score above the study population mean.

Sleep and circadian/physiological dysregulation consistent with risk: Objective and subjective sleep and circadian metrics show patterns commonly linked with depressive symptoms. The participant’s PSQI score is 8 (classified as disturbed sleep), sleep timing is late on average (median sleep start ≈ 01:03 AM) and sleep timing variability is elevated (sleep start SD z = 0.86). Night-to-night sleep duration variability is high (SD = 156 minutes, z = 1.25) even though median sleep duration (~6 h 59 min) is only slightly below average. Heart‑rate‑based circadian features show a dampened rhythm (amplitude = 5.34, z = -1.76) and low interdaily stability (0.20, z = -1.73), together indicating a blunted and less regular physiological daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is relatively high (70.8 bpm, z = 1.50). These objective sleep/circadian/physiological findings (disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, high sleep variability, reduced circadian amplitude, and elevated resting HR) align with increased depressive symptom risk.

Behavioral and social context: Several lifestyle features support the same interpretation while others are more protective. The participant reports relatively little socializing (socializing z = -0.62) and limited solitary exercise (exercising alone z = -0.43), though exercising with others is reported at a modest frequency (1–2 times/week, z = 0.53). Health satisfaction is low (z = -1.45). High reported time listening to music (more than 4 hours, z = 2.06) is positively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.26) and may reflect a coping behavior associated with distress in this cohort. In contrast, several protective or neutral behaviors are present: little recreational drug use, relatively low problematic alcohol use, consistent strong academic performance (GPAs mostly high), and no daytime napping. These protective indices temper but do not outweigh the multiple signals of internal distress and physiological dysregulation.

Physiological daily profile (hourly HR deviations and summary circadian parameters): The participant’s MESOR (76.9 bpm, z = 0.41) is modestly above average and the aggregated hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal heart‑rate nadir and daytime elevations, with acrophase around 5:00 PM. However, the small amplitude and reduced day‑to‑day stability indicate less contrast between active and rest periods and weaker regularity across days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is below average (z ≈ -0.78). Intradaily variability is near average. In sum, while the basic diurnal shape is present, the reduced amplitude and stability are consistent with blunted physiological rhythmicity that has been linked to higher depressive symptoms.

Overall inference relative to the study population mean CES‑D: Integrating self-report, behavioral, sleep, and objective physiological signals, the balance of evidence favors an inference that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.32). The strongest contributors to this inference are high trait anxiety (STAI), low self‑esteem, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), elevated perceived stress, low health satisfaction, and objective signs of circadian blunting and elevated resting heart rate — several of which have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES‑D in the sample. Countervailing indicators (good academic performance, low substance use, absence of naps, some social/ group exercise) reduce the probability of severe symptomatology but do not fully offset the multiple risk signals. This conclusion is probabilistic: the dataset does not include the participant’s CES‑D raw score, and observed relationships are correlational and may be confounded by other factors (e.g., academic workload, seasonal effects, medication, or physical health)."
51437,"Indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms are present primarily in the wearable-derived physiological and sleep data. The participant shows a comparatively elevated resting heart rate (73 bpm; Z = +1.77) and a higher mesor (83.4; Z = +1.29), both of which have modest positive correlations with CES‑D in this sample. Circadian features point to reduced amplitude (amplitude = 5.87; Z = −1.59) and increased intradaily variability (IV = 0.76; Z = +1.51), a pattern often interpreted as blunted and fragmented circadian organization; blunted amplitude and greater fragmentation have been associated with worse mood in prior work and in this dataset (amplitude correlation with CES‑D = −0.11, IV correlation ≈ 0). Objectively poor and delayed sleep also aligns with risk: median nightly sleep duration is short (6 h 15 min; Z = −1.16), self-reported PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), and sleep start is markedly delayed (median start ≈ 02:14 AM) with relatively consistent late timing (SD 32 min; Z = −1.12). Aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show unusually high positive deviations around midnight (12–1 AM deviation = +25.6; Z = +3.91 and 11 PM–12 AM = +13.7; Z = +1.52), which may reflect evening physiological arousal or activity patterns that are atypical relative to the study population. Taken together, these physiological and sleep features are characteristic of a circadian and autonomic profile that, in this sample and literature, is more often observed with elevated depressive symptoms.

Conversely, several psychosocial and behavioral measures point toward lower depressive symptom burden. The participant reports relatively high self‑esteem (Rosenberg self‑esteem Z = +0.96), a variable with a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ −0.71). Trait anxiety (STAI‑Trait = 35) is below the sample mean (Z = −0.62), and perceived stress is not elevated (PSS Z = −0.44), both suggesting lower subjective distress. The participant also demonstrates multiple lifestyle factors associated with protective effects: frequent exercise and sports participation (exercise/sports Zs = +1.07 and +1.58), low recreational drug use, modest alcohol use, moderate social contact (socializing 1–2 hours), and relatively high health satisfaction (Z = +0.30). Academic performance appears strong (GPAs ≈ 3.69–3.72), which can be a marker of functional engagement. Self‑reported current happiness is somewhat below the sample mean (Current happy Z = −0.53), but on balance the self‑report profile (high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, active exercise habits) is more consistent with lower depressive symptom levels.

Integrating the modalities yields a mixed picture: objective physiology and sleep suggest elevated risk (circadian blunting, fragmented rhythms, delayed and short sleep, elevated resting heart rate), while self‑report psychosocial factors and behaviors are largely protective (high self‑esteem, regular exercise, low anxiety and stress relative to the sample, low substance use). The relative strengths of these signals differ: the self‑report self‑esteem measure has a strong sample correlation with CES‑D and is substantially above average (Z ≈ +1.0), whereas several wearable markers (resting HR, amplitude, IV) deviate from the sample mean in directions associated with higher depressive symptoms but have smaller sample correlations with CES‑D. The late and short sleep pattern is a salient cross‑modal finding (objective short/delayed sleep plus subjective PSQI > 5) and therefore may be the most meaningful specific risk factor in this participant’s profile.

Considering all available evidence and the sample statistics (sample CES‑D mean = 13.33, SD = 9.61), the participant’s overall depressive symptom level, as inferred from these data, is best described as near the study population mean. Physiological and sleep markers introduce measurable risk for higher CES‑D relative to peers, but strong protective psychosocial and behavioral indicators likely mitigate overall symptom burden; thus the net estimate is not clearly above the mean. This synthesis does not replace a direct CES‑D score or clinical evaluation; it highlights patterns (late/short sleep, circadian fragmentation, elevated resting HR versus high self‑esteem and active lifestyle) that could be prioritized for monitoring or targeted intervention if depressive symptoms increase."
21932,"Summary: The participant’s data present a mixed multimodal profile. Self-report measures show especially strong signals on trait factors related to mood and stress (high self-esteem: RSES z = +1.66; low trait anxiety: STAI z = -1.31; low perceived stress: PSS z = -2.34), while sleep-related measures and some behavioral markers show indications of disturbance or reduced engagement (PSQI = 8, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”; lower self-reported current happiness z = -0.53; reduced time socializing z = -0.62). Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac markers are generally orderly (interdaily stability z = +0.67; mesor and resting heart rate below the sample mean, mesor z = -0.58, RHR z = -0.48) but include elevated intradaily variability (z = +0.95) and unusually large hourly heart-rate deviations in specific windows (notably 10–11 pm, deviation z = +3.14, and midday 12–2 pm, z > +2.0). Many of the wearable-derived features show small correlations with CES‑D in this sample; the strongest relationships in the dataset originate in the self-report trait measures.

Features that point toward higher depressive symptom levels: 
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8; PSQI z = +0.59 and classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), despite objectively long and regular sleep, suggests nonrestorative sleep or poor perceived sleep quality — a factor consistently associated with greater depressive symptoms. 
- Lower current happiness (self-report z = -0.53; correlation with CES‑D r ≈ -0.46) and reduced engagement in leisure/social activities (socializing z = -0.62 and several “do not do” responses for passive/recreational activities) can reflect reduced positive affect and behavioral withdrawal, both linked to higher depressive symptoms. 
- Elevated intradaily variability in circadian measures (z = +0.95) and pronounced late-evening heart-rate elevation (10–11 pm deviation z = +3.14) could indicate fragmented activity/rest patterns or evening physiological arousal; such patterns have been associated with worse mood regulation in some studies, even though in this dataset the direct correlations with CES‑D are small.

Features that point toward lower depressive symptom levels:
- Trait and stress-related measures strongly favor lower depressive symptoms: low trait anxiety (STAI = 28, z = -1.31; STAI–CES‑D correlation r ≈ +0.81 implies low anxiety predicts lower CES‑D), high self-esteem (RSES z = +1.66; r ≈ -0.71), and low perceived stress (PSS z = -2.34). These are large, consistent signals in directions associated with lower CES‑D scores. 
- Academic performance and health satisfaction are high (GPA consistently near or at the top of the scale; health satisfaction z ≈ +0.55), and substance-use measures show minimal use; these behavioral markers are generally protective or not suggestive of elevated depressive symptoms. 
- Wearable measures indicate relatively regular circadian structure (interdaily stability z = +0.67, moderate amplitude z = +0.44) and a lower average heart rate/resting heart rate (mesor z = -0.58; RHR z = -0.48), which more often reflect fitness or physiological steadiness rather than a depression-linked dysregulation (and the wearable–CES‑D correlations provided are mostly small).

Holistic inference relative to the study sample mean: Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most predictive signals in this dataset are the trait and stress self-reports (low anxiety, high self‑esteem, low perceived stress), which are robustly associated with lower CES‑D scores in this sample (large correlation magnitudes). Subjective sleep problems and some behavioral signs (reduced happiness and social/leisure engagement) provide contrary evidence but are weaker in magnitude or less strongly correlated with CES‑D here. Overall, the preponderance of high-effect, protective indicators suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.33). This conclusion is qualified: there are specific risk-relevant features—subjective sleep disturbance, reduced positive affect and social/leisure engagement, and some circadian fragmentation—that warrant monitoring because they could increase vulnerability even if current global symptom burden is likely lower than average.

Uncertainty and recommendations for interpretation: Many wearable-derived features in this record show weak correlations with CES‑D in the available sample, so physiological signals should be interpreted cautiously and in context. The discrepancy between objective sleep (long, regular durations) and subjective poor sleep quality (PSQI = 8) is notable and clinically meaningful: it suggests sleep-related distress or nonrestorative sleep that is not captured purely by duration metrics. If the goal is ongoing monitoring or risk assessment, prioritizing repeated self-report measures of mood, sleep quality, and anxiety along with targeted inquiry about evening arousal/activities would help clarify whether the identified risk features are transient or persistent."
36385,"Summary of key self-report indicators and their implications:
The participant’s self-report profile contains several signals associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is relatively high (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76) and, in this dataset, STAI shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), making it one of the most salient risk-related indicators. Self-esteem is relatively low (Rosenberg = 31; Z = −1.01) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = −0.71), which likewise points toward higher depressive symptomatology when considered with the anxiety score. Subjective sleep quality is in the disturbed range (PSQI = 6), which is commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms; although the PSQI z-score is modest (Z = −0.33), the categorical classification of disturbed sleep supports increased risk. Perceived stress is slightly elevated (PSS = 22; Z = 0.1) and has a small positive association with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.28). Together, the combination of elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, disturbed sleep, and some perceived stress forms the strongest self-report evidence pointing toward a relatively higher CES-D level.

Self-report and behavioral indicators that counterbalance risk:
There are several self-report traits and lifestyle features that point away from marked depressive symptomatology or that may be protective. The participant reports moderate current happiness (self-rated = 4.0; Z = 0.55) and a relatively high level of interpersonal trust (Trust Z = 0.83), both of which correlate negatively with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ −0.46 and r = −0.42, respectively). Exercise participation is present (sports/exercise roughly 1–2 times per week) and substance use is low (no recreational or non-prescribed drug use; modest alcohol use), which are behavioral patterns typically associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Academic performance (GPA history) is strong, which may reflect functional capacity and engagement. These protective features temper but do not eliminate the risk signaled by the high-anxiety / low-self-esteem profile.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show long median nightly sleep duration (median = 8 h 47 min; Z = 2.0), but also notable variability in both sleep duration (SD ≈ 133 min; Z = 0.73) and sleep start time (median start ≈ 00:54; start-time SD ≈ 140 min; Z = 1.26). Long average sleep can reflect adequate rest for some individuals but, in the context of disturbed subjective sleep and high variability in timing, may also reflect irregular sleep patterns or oversleeping/hypersomnia-like patterns; in this dataset greater variability in sleep timing/duration is modestly positively correlated with CES-D (sleep SD r ≈ 0.19; sleep-start SD r ≈ 0.21). Circadian rhythm estimates derived from heart rate (interdaily stability ≈ 0.44; intradaily variability ≈ 0.56; amplitude near sample mean) indicate a reasonably regular rhythm at the summary level rather than a profoundly flattened or fragmented circadian profile. Resting heart rate (≈64 bpm; Z = 0.7) and mesor are slightly above the sample mean and show small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), which provides only modest physiological support for elevated symptom burden. The hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show normal nocturnal lows and daytime peaks; their correlations with CES-D are minimal at the hourly level, indicating no clear, strong diurnal heart-rate signature of depressive symptoms in this participant.

Balanced interpretation of converging evidence:
The strongest, most informative signals in the multimodal data are the self-report trait measures: elevated trait anxiety and low self-esteem—both highly correlated with CES-D in this sample—point toward a higher level of depressive symptoms than the sample average. Subjective disturbed sleep and moderate variability in sleep timing/duration add to that risk, albeit with smaller effect sizes. In contrast, protective indicators (current self-reported happiness, greater interpersonal trust, regular participation in physical activity, low substance use, intact academic functioning and a generally preserved circadian rhythm) act to moderate overall risk. Objective physiology from the wearable does not show major circadian breakdown or persistent nocturnal arousal that would strongly amplify the self-report risk signal; resting HR and some night-to-night variability are mildly elevated but not extreme.

Overall conclusion relative to the study population mean:
Taking the totality of evidence into account, the balance of risk and protective features suggests that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.27). This inference is driven primarily by the participant’s relatively high trait anxiety and low self-esteem—two variables that have the largest correlations with CES-D in the sample—and is supported by disturbed subjective sleep and elevated variability in sleep timing. At the same time, the participant’s protective factors and broadly intact circadian physiology indicate that the elevation is more consistent with a modest-to-moderate increase above the population mean rather than an extreme outlier; wearable measures do not show the substantial physiological dysregulation that would indicate very severe symptomatology. Overall: likely above the population mean, but not unequivocally extreme based on the available multimodal data.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation:
Correlations reported in the dataset vary in magnitude; the most diagnostic measures here are those with the largest sample correlations (STAI and self-esteem). Many wearable-derived associations with CES-D are small, so conclusions that rely heavily on the wearable metrics should be made cautiously. These findings describe probabilistic associations and do not constitute a clinical diagnosis; they are best used to guide further assessment or monitoring (e.g., targeted screening for depressive symptoms, focused inquiry into sleep timing variability and anxiety)."
54030,"Protective indicators (features consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms)
The self-report profile contains several strong signals that, in prior work, are associated with lower CES‑D scores. The participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 27, Z = −1.41), elevated self‑esteem (RSES Z = +1.52) and a high momentary happiness rating (Z = +1.64). Substance use is essentially absent, social time is above average (socializing 2–3 hours, Z ≈ +0.95), and health satisfaction is above the sample mean (Z ≈ +0.72). The PSQI score (5.0, classified as “Good Sleep”, Z = −0.8) does not indicate severe subjective sleep disturbance. These self‑report features all point toward relatively lower levels of affective distress and are each negatively correlated with CES‑D in the study sample (strongest being self‑esteem, r ≈ −0.71), which together suggest a psychological profile that would tend to reduce the likelihood of a high CES‑D score.

Risk indicators (features consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms)
Physiological and behavioral traces from the wearable and some objective sleep measures indicate circadian irregularity and fragmented sleep–wake patterns that have been linked with higher depressive symptoms. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.28, Z = −1.07) while intradaily variability is elevated (0.88, Z = +2.36), indicating a less regular, more fragmented daily rhythm. Amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm is reduced (Z = −1.29) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = −1.20), which together indicate blunted and less consistent circadian structure — features that, in the literature, are associated with greater depressive symptomatology. Sleep as measured by the wearable is shorter than the sample median (median sleep ~6 h 18 m, Z = −1.09), has high night‑to‑night variability (SD ≈ 143 minutes, Z ≈ +0.96), a very late median sleep start time (~02:57), and elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps Z ≈ +1.75). These objective sleep irregularities (shorter average sleep, late and variable bedtimes, more naps) are commonly linked to increased depressive symptoms and can offset some of the protective self‑report signals.

Integrative interpretation and relative weight of evidence
Weighing the two data domains, the strongest and most internally consistent evidence for lower depressive symptoms comes from robust self‑report measures (low anxiety, high self‑esteem, high happiness, low substance use, good subjective sleep quality). These self‑report indicators also show relatively large correlations with CES‑D in the sample (especially self‑esteem). The wearable-derived indicators point to circadian disruption and sleep irregularity; these are meaningful risk markers but their correlations with CES‑D in this sample are modest. In other words, objective behavior shows moderate risk-related features (late, short, variable sleep and high intradaily variability), while self‑reported mood and functioning are notably positive. Because the self‑report measures directly index affective state and show substantial effect sizes in sample correlations, they carry considerable weight in the overall picture, but the objective circadian/sleep irregularities represent a meaningful behavioral vulnerability that could increase risk over time or under stress.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests that the participant’s overall depressive symptom level, as inferred from this multimodal dataset, is likely below the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.34). Self‑report indicators strongly point toward lower depressive symptoms, while wearable measures indicate circadian and sleep irregularities that constitute an intermediate risk. This is best summarized as a profile with generally lower depressive symptom burden than the sample average but with identifiable behavioral/physiological vulnerabilities (irregular sleep timing, greater sleep variability, and blunted circadian amplitude) that could predispose to increases in symptoms if other stressors emerge.

Notes and caveats
These inferences integrate cross‑sectional self‑report and aggregated wearable measures; correlations reported in the dataset are associative and not causal. The heart‑rate circadian metrics are aggregated across days and do not allow assessment of temporal changes or event‑level relationships between mood and physiology. Continued monitoring of sleep regularity and targeted behavioral interventions (e.g., sleep timing stabilization) could be informative given the mismatch between positive self‑reported affect and objective circadian disruption."
34062,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile contains a mix of protective and risk-related indicators for depressive symptoms. Self-report measures show relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = +1.38) and current happiness (Z = +1.64), along with above-average health satisfaction (Z = +1.80) and regular exercise (exercising alone and with others both Z ≈ +1.1 to +1.2). At the same time, the participant reports elevated perceived stress (PSS Z = +1.19) and notably poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10, Z = +1.52, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”). Wearable-derived physiology shows a low average heart-rate MESOR (58.7 bpm, Z = -2.08) and a low resting heart rate (45.7 bpm, Z = -1.48), relatively normal median sleep duration (7 h 6 m, Z = -0.11) but moderate night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 95 minutes, Z = +0.26). Circadian/regularity features are somewhat blunted (interdaily stability Z = -0.41; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = -0.87), while hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal dip and afternoon/evening elevations (largest positive deviations 5–7 pm). Below I outline the specific evidence that points toward higher versus lower depressive symptom burden, then give an integrated appraisal relative to the study population mean CES-D (13.32).

Evidence consistent with elevated depressive symptoms: 
- Subjective sleep disturbance is prominent: PSQI = 10 (Z = +1.52, classified as disturbed). Poor perceived sleep quality is a well-established correlate of depressive symptoms and is present here despite objectively adequate median sleep duration. 
- Perceived stress is elevated (PSS Z = +1.19) and stress shows a positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ +0.29), suggesting stress-related risk for depressive symptoms. 
- Circadian regularity measures are attenuated: interdaily stability (Z = -0.41) and especially autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = -0.87) are lower than the sample mean, indicating less-consistent daily heart-rate rhythms. Lower circadian stability and greater variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD Z = +0.26) have been associated with higher depressive symptoms in population studies. 
- Some wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show late-evening irregularities (e.g., negative deviations around 9–11 pm with Zs down to -1.6 to -2.65), which could reflect fragmented or non-restorative night physiology in some nights and is consistent with the participant’s reported disturbed sleep.

Evidence consistent with lower depressive symptoms:
- Several strong protective self-reports: high self-esteem (RSES Z = +1.38) and above-average current happiness (Z = +1.64) both correlate negatively with CES-D in this sample (self-esteem r ≈ -0.71, happiness r ≈ -0.46). These are sizable effects and point toward lower depressive symptomatology. 
- The participant reports regular exercise (both alone and with others, Z ≈ +1.1 to +1.2), which is weakly associated with lower CES-D here and is generally protective for mood. 
- Health satisfaction is high (Z = +1.80), and the participant’s STAI trait anxiety score is not elevated (STAI Z = -0.52), a profile that typically aligns with lower depressive symptoms. 
- Objective sleep quantity (median 7 h 6 m, Z ≈ -0.11) and low mean daily nap frequency (0.14, Z = +0.82 but low absolute) do not suggest hypersomnolence or severe sleep loss, which can be features of higher depression severity. 
- Wearable physiology indicates a low resting heart rate and low MESOR (Zs -1.48 and -2.08), which commonly reflect good cardiovascular fitness rather than a stress-reactive profile; in this dataset MESOR and resting HR show only small positive correlations with CES-D, so these features are more neutral-to-protective than strongly risky.

Integration and interpretation of circadian/physiological data: 
The heart-rate cosinor summary indicates a relatively low MESOR and modest amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -0.40) with an acrophase in mid-afternoon (~3:08 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough (large negative deviations overnight) and pronounced daytime/evening peaks (notably 5–7 pm). Overall, the participant’s physiology shows preserved night-day separation but somewhat dampened circadian stability across days (lower interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation). The pattern is most consistent with a generally active daytime profile and good cardiovascular fitness, combined with variability in day-to-day timing and subjective sleep complaints. Because the associations between the wearable circadian metrics and CES-D in this sample are relatively small or mixed, physiological data alone are not decisive but do support the idea of circadian irregularity as a modest risk factor in this profile.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean CES-D (13.32):
Weighing the evidence, the profile contains both meaningful protective signals (notably high self-esteem, high reported happiness, regular exercise, and high health satisfaction) and notable risk signals (elevated subjective sleep disturbance, elevated perceived stress, and reduced circadian regularity). Given the magnitude of the negative correlations between self-esteem/happiness and CES-D in this sample (particularly the strong inverse relation with self-esteem) and the participant’s relatively large positive Z-scores on those protective measures, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES-D score (i.e., below 13.32). This conclusion is tempered by the presence of sleep disturbance and stress, so the participant may still have subclinical or situational symptoms that warrant monitoring or brief intervention focused on sleep and stress management. Overall, the participant’s multimodal data are more consistent with lower-than-average depressive symptom burden but with specific, addressable areas of risk (subjective sleep quality and circadian regularity).

Uncertainty and recommended focus: 
Because objective sleep duration is adequate while subjective sleep quality is poor, and because circadian regularity metrics are reduced, further assessment focused on sleep quality (sleep fragmentation, insomnia symptoms) and stressors would clarify whether the sleep reports reflect transient stress-related disturbances or a more persistent sleep disorder that could elevate depressive symptoms over time."
18111,"Summary judgment
Taken together, the multimodal evidence suggests the participant’s pattern of symptoms and physiology is most consistent with depressive symptomatology that is likely above the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.27). Key contributors to this inference are elevated trait anxiety (STAI), high perceived stress, low self‑reported happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, and objective markers of circadian irregularity and blunted rhythm amplitude. Balancing these, there are also notable protective signals (relatively preserved self‑esteem, good academic performance, and overall adequate median nightly sleep duration). On balance, however, the preponderance and magnitude of risk‑related indicators make an “above the population mean” classification the most consistent with the available data.

Features consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- High trait anxiety and perceived stress: The STAI trait score is elevated (48, z ≈ 0.66) and this measure has a very strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.81), making it one of the most influential risk markers. Perceived stress is also high (PSS = 28, z ≈ 1.74), which aligns with greater depressive symptoms in the cohort (positive correlation ~0.28).
- Low current subjective well‑being: The participant’s self‑reported happiness is low (current = 2, z ≈ −1.61) and correlates negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.46), indicating that low momentary happiness is linked to higher depressive symptoms.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and sleep timing irregularity: The PSQI is in the disturbed range (score = 8, z ≈ 0.59). Although median nightly duration is within a normative range, the participant reports late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 1:19 AM), substantial night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing (SD ≈ 69 minutes), and elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps = 0.27, z ≈ 2.27). Disturbed subjective sleep plus irregular timing and more frequent napping are commonly associated with higher depressive symptom burden.
- Circadian and activity rhythm markers that map onto risk: Wearable‑derived interdaily stability is low (0.24, z ≈ −1.40), amplitude is reduced (6.21, z ≈ −1.48), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (z ≈ −0.95). These findings indicate a relatively weak, less regular day‑to‑day heart‑rate rhythm and a flattened circadian amplitude—features that have been linked to higher depressive symptoms. Several evening hours show relatively large positive deviations from the mesor (notably 8–9pm has a strong positive deviation, z ≈ 1.85), which may reflect elevated physiological arousal in the evening for this participant.
- Behavioral indicators concordant with risk: Increased evening internet use (2–3 hours, z ≈ 0.85), modestly elevated alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week, z ≈ 0.9–1.0), and low engagement in sports are additional behavioral correlates that, in aggregate, modestly trend toward established depression‑related patterns in population data.

Features consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms (protective)
- Relatively preserved self‑esteem and academic functioning: The Rosenberg Self‑Esteem score is in the healthy range (36, z ≈ −0.31) and has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ −0.71). High GPA across semesters indicates intact cognitive/occupational functioning, which is protective against higher depressive symptom burden.
- Adequate median total nocturnal sleep duration: Median nightly sleep is ~7 h 16 min (z ≈ 0.1), which is within the typical recommended range and may attenuate risk associated with sleep disturbance. Resting heart rate is normal (≈58 bpm, z ≈ 0.01), which does not point to autonomic hyperarousal at rest.
- Social activity and some exercise: The participant reports socializing 1–2 hours and exercising (alone and with others) 1–2 times per week, which are modestly protective behavioral anchors compared to more isolated or sedentary profiles.

Physiological pattern and interpretation
- Circadian structure and hourly heart‑rate deviations: Cosinor parameters show a lower amplitude and slightly lower MESOR (71.11 bpm, z ≈ −0.39), and the acrophase is in the early evening (~5:40 PM). The low interdaily stability and low 24‑hour autocorrelation suggest the participant’s cardiac activity rhythm is inconsistent across days. Elevated intradaily variability (z ≈ 0.24) indicates within‑day fragmentation of activity/rest states. Evening hours (especially 8–9pm and surrounding hours) show above‑mesor heart‑rate deviations (largest z scores at 8–9pm), which can reflect greater evening arousal or activity and may be mechanistically linked to later sleep timing and perceived sleep problems. Collectively, the wearable evidence points to a blunted but somewhat irregular circadian profile, a pattern that is commonly observed with increased depressive symptoms.
- Sleep microstructure from wearables versus self‑report: Objective median sleep duration is adequate, but variability in sleep timing and a high nap frequency suggest non‑restorative or misaligned sleep behavior. The PSQI, which captures subjective quality, corroborates disturbed sleep. In combination, subjective disturbance plus irregular timing and naps is more informative than duration alone and leans toward higher symptom burden.

Integrated conclusion and degree of confidence
Weighing the strong positive indicators (notably elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, low current happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, and circadian irregularity with reduced amplitude) against protective signals (preserved self‑esteem, high GPA, normal median sleep duration), the net evidence favors an inference of depressive symptom levels above the study sample mean (13.27). The inference is supported especially by measures with high sample correlations to CES‑D (STAI, self‑esteem, happiness). Confidence in the direction of elevation is moderate to high given convergent signals across self‑report and wearables, but the presence of meaningful protective factors suggests the elevation may be moderate rather than extreme.

If you would like, I can (a) map these observations to specific CES‑D symptom domains (e.g., affective, somatic, interpersonal) using the available data, (b) produce a brief bullet list of targets for further assessment or monitoring, or (c) generate visual summaries of the circadian and sleep features for presentation."
59097,"Summary statement
The participant’s data present a mixed profile: several self-report indicators (notably elevated trait anxiety, low momentary happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, and reduced interpersonal trust) point toward higher depressive symptomatology, while wearable-derived circadian regularity, relatively long and stable nocturnal sleep, sustained daytime physiological amplitude, and adequate social/academic functioning point toward lower symptom levels. Weighing these signals together, the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels that are likely at or modestly above the study sample mean CES-D (population mean = 13.27), rather than far below or extremely elevated.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher depressive symptoms
Self-report measures that are strongly associated with CES-D indicate increased risk. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) is elevated and this scale has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81), which is a robust indicator of greater depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61; correlation with CES-D r = -0.46), which directly aligns with higher depressive symptom scores. Subjective sleep disturbance is also notable (PSQI = 8, classified as “disturbed sleep,” Z = 0.59), and poor sleep quality commonly accompanies higher CES-D scores. Other self-report features that favor a higher CES-D interpretation include modestly lower interpersonal trust (Trust Z = -0.78; r = -0.41) and a Rosenberg Self-Esteem score slightly below the sample average (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31; r = -0.71), both of which are associated with greater depressive symptoms in this cohort. The participant’s late habitual sleep onset (median start ~01:07) combined with some alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 1.0) are additional contextual factors that can co-occur with elevated mood symptoms.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower depressive symptoms
Objective wearable-derived circadian and sleep metrics provide evidence against a severe depressive symptom level. The participant shows high interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33) and high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.23), indicating a regular, consistent day-to-day rhythm in heart-rate patterns—features that are generally associated with lower depression risk. Intradaily variability is low (0.33, Z = -1.52), indicating little fragmentation of activity across the day, and the cosinor amplitude is relatively large (Amplitude = 14.74, Z = 1.28), signifying a clear day–night contrast in physiological arousal; both of these wearable patterns are typically protective or associated with lower depressive symptom burden. Nocturnal sleep duration is long and stable (median = 8 h 23 min, Z = 1.50; sleep start SD Z = -0.99 and sleep-duration SD Z = -0.62), and the participant reports essentially no napping—together these indicate consolidated nocturnal sleep rather than fragmented or highly irregular sleep, which can mitigate depressive symptom expression. Functionally, the participant reports substantial social time with friends (2–3 hours daily, Z = 0.95) and maintains strong academic performance (GPA ~3.6–3.7), both of which are behavioral indicators that often align with lower or moderate rather than severe depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean
Integrating self-report and wearable findings yields a nuanced picture. Self-report indices that are tightly correlated with CES-D (especially trait anxiety and momentary unhappiness) point toward elevated depressive symptoms, but objective circadian stability, consolidated sleep, and intact social and academic functioning argue against very high symptom severity. Given the balance—meaningful self-report risk signals but strong, consistent physiological rhythms and functional engagement—the most defensible position is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study sample mean CES-D score (13.27) but not at an extreme level. In other words, the profile suggests a modest-to-moderate elevation relative to the sample average rather than severe or minimal depressive symptoms.

Caveats
This interpretation relies on cross-sectional and aggregate indicators: correlations provided are associative and not diagnostic, some effects point in opposing directions (self-report vs. objective physiology), and the CES-D score itself is not provided here. For clinical decisions or definitive classification, direct CES-D scores and clinical assessment would be necessary."
24833,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of behavioral and physiological features that both increase and decrease the likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Psychosocial self-report measures (notably higher self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, and relatively high health satisfaction) provide comparatively strong evidence for lower CES‑D scores, whereas objective wearable-derived circadian irregularity, late sleep timing and subjective sleep disturbance provide the most salient evidence in the direction of elevated depressive symptoms. Considering the balance of evidence and the strength of the associations in this dataset, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is most consistent with being near the population mean CES‑D score, with a modest tendency toward being below the mean.

Factors that point toward higher depressive symptoms
- Circadian rhythm and activity regularity: Interdaily stability (0.17, Z = -1.98) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.11, Z = -1.79) are both markedly low relative to the sample, indicating weak day‑to‑day regularity of heart‑rate circadian rhythm. Amplitude is also reduced (5.9, Z = -1.58). These features reflect blunted and irregular circadian structure—patterns that are commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms and behavioral dysregulation. Although the direct dataset correlations for some circadian metrics with CES‑D are small, the magnitude of the deviations from the sample (large negative Zs) makes them a notable risk signal in this participant.
- Sleep timing and subjective sleep quality: The median sleep start time is late (about 02:10 AM), and the PSQI score is 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating clinically relevant subjective sleep difficulties. Median nightly sleep duration is modestly below average (6 h 55 min, Z = -0.32). Late and irregular sleep timing combined with subjective sleep disturbance are behavioral features frequently linked to higher depressive symptoms.
- Physiological arousal: Resting heart rate (64.7 bpm, Z = 0.78) and a somewhat elevated MESOR (76.86, Z = 0.40) suggest a modestly higher baseline cardiovascular level. Resting heart rate shows a small-to-moderate positive correlation with CES‑D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.19), making this a supportive physiological marker for somewhat greater symptom burden.
- Reduced subjective positive affect: Current self‑reported happiness is below the sample mean (score 3.0, Z = -0.53) and correlates negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.46); this lower positive affect is consistent with increased depressive symptomatology.

Factors that point toward lower depressive symptoms
- Trait anxiety and self‑esteem: Trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82) is below the sample mean and is strongly correlated with CES‑D in the dataset (r ≈ 0.81), so the participant’s lower anxiety proneness is a substantial protective signal. Self‑esteem is above average (RSES Z = 0.82) and has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), providing another robust protective indicator.
- Health satisfaction and substance use / social activity: Health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 0.80), which correlates modestly with lower CES‑D (r ≈ -0.39). The participant reports limited recreational drug use (none), moderate exercise (1–2 times/week), and modest socialization (1–2 hours/day) — behaviors that are not strongly associated with increased CES‑D in this dataset and in some cases are modestly protective.
- Objective sleep quantity variability: Sleep duration variability is not elevated (SD 98 minutes, Z = -0.07) and mean daily naps are absent (0.0, Z = -0.86), which reduces the likelihood that excessive daytime napping or highly unstable sleep quantity are driving symptoms. Some wearable hourly heart‑rate deviations show a typical overnight trough and an evening peak (acrophase ~5:40 PM), a pattern that is not strongly pathological by itself.

Holistic synthesis and likely positioning relative to the study sample mean
- Strength of protective vs. risk signals: The strongest and most directly predictive psychosocial signals in the dataset favor lower depressive symptoms (notably low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem, both of which have substantial correlations with CES‑D). The wearable‑derived circadian markers show clear deviations from the sample mean (very low interdaily stability and weak 24‑hour autocorrelation and amplitude), and subjective sleep disturbance is present; these are important risk indicators but their direct correlations with CES‑D in this dataset are smaller than those for anxiety and self‑esteem.
- Net inference: Given the combination of robust self‑report protective indicators (low trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem, good health satisfaction) together with objective circadian irregularity and disturbed sleep, the most parsimonious inference is that the participant’s depressive symptom level is near the study sample mean and most likely slightly below it rather than substantially above it. In other words: compared with the population mean CES‑D of 13.32 (SD = 9.62), this participant’s profile is broadly consistent with “near the mean,” with a modest tendency toward lower depressive symptoms driven by psychosocial resilience factors.

Key caveats
- The dataset does not provide a directly observed CES‑D score for the participant, so this inference relies on the pattern of correlates within the sample and the participant’s z‑scores. Some objective circadian measures show large deviations from the sample and could represent meaningful risk even when self‑report resilience is present; longitudinal change or clinical assessment could clarify whether these physiological patterns predict increasing symptoms over time.
- Correlations reported in the dataset vary in magnitude; where correlations are small, the directional evidence should be treated as weak. Behavioral and physiological markers should be interpreted in combination rather than individually.

If desired, I can convert this synthesis into a brief bullet‑point clinical summary for use in reporting or prepare follow‑up recommendations (e.g., further assessment of sleep timing and circadian regularity, monitoring of mood over time)."
84502,"Summary and overall impression
Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics, the participant shows a mixed profile but with stronger evidence for relatively lower depressive symptomatology than the study sample mean. Key protective signals include low trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33), relatively high self‑esteem (RSES Z = 0.4), frequent socially shared exercise (exercising with others: Z = 1.23), low resting heart rate (RHR = 52.6 bpm, Z = -0.66), and a well-structured circadian rhythm by actigraphy-derived heart rate (interdaily stability = 0.55, Z = 1.16). These markers—many of which have negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample—point toward more favorable mood-related functioning. Balancing these, the participant reports subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52) and lowered current happiness (self-rated “Happy” Z = -0.53), which are factors that relate to higher depressive symptoms. Taking the full multimodal record together, the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.3), while acknowledging some risk indicators that merit monitoring.

Factors in the profile that align with higher CES-D scores
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The PSQI score of 10 (Z = 1.52) indicates clinically relevant, self-reported sleep problems. PSQI in this dataset is positively associated with CES‑D in the sample, so poor subjective sleep quality here is a salient risk marker.  
- Lower momentary happiness and moderate stress: The participant’s current happiness rating is below the sample mean (Z = -0.53) and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS Z = 0.38); both of these correlate in the expected directions with CES‑D (happiness negatively, stress positively). These self-reports suggest some affective strain despite other protective signs.  
- Sleep timing variability and sleep stability signals: Although median sleep duration is within a typical range, sleep duration standard deviation (109 minutes) and some variability in sleep onset (sleep-start SD Z ≈ -0.39 but non‑negligible absolute variability) are associated in the sample with higher CES‑D; the participant’s sleep is somewhat irregular even if total duration is adequate.  
- Small midday autonomic dip: The aggregated heart rate deviation shows a pronounced negative deviation around 2–3pm (Z ≈ -2.04). While isolated, such mid‑day low arousal could reflect lower daytime activation in some contexts and is weakly related to depressive symptoms in the sample (small correlations).

Factors in the profile that align with lower CES-D scores
- Low trait anxiety and elevated self-esteem: The participant’s STAI score is below average (Z = -0.33) and self‑esteem is above average (RSES Z = 0.4). In the study sample these measures show strong correlations with CES‑D (STAI positively correlated, self‑esteem strongly negatively correlated), so these are substantial protective indicators.  
- Regular circadian structure and activity rhythm: Interdaily stability (0.55, Z = 1.16) and a positive autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 0.81) indicate consistent day-to-day rhythmicity in heart-rate activity. Greater circadian regularity is generally protective with respect to depressive symptoms and is reflected here.  
- Objective sleep quantity and low resting arousal: Median nightly sleep of ~7 h 31 min (Z = 0.41) meets typical duration recommendations, and resting heart rate is low (52.6 bpm, Z = -0.66), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower autonomic arousal—both of which are weakly associated with lower CES‑D in the sample.  
- Healthy lifestyle behaviors: Minimal substance use, frequent socially shared exercise (Z = 1.23), and relatively high interpersonal trust (Z = 0.83) are behavioral assets that correlate negatively with depressive symptoms in the sample and likely buffer against higher CES‑D scores.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population
Balancing risks and protections, the multimodal profile is more consistent with depressive symptomatology below the study sample mean CES‑D score of 13.3. The strongest contributors to this inference are low trait anxiety, elevated self‑esteem, structured circadian/heart‑rate rhythms, regular objective sleep duration, and active, socially shared exercise—features that in the sample have meaningful negative associations with CES‑D. Countervailing evidence (notably a PSQI of 10 indicating subjective sleep disturbance, reduced momentary happiness, and some within-subject sleep variability) suggests areas of vulnerability that could elevate depressive symptoms if they worsen or persist. 

Limitations and caveats
This interpretation synthesizes cross-sectional and aggregated signals and uses sample correlations for context; it is not a clinical diagnosis and cannot replace a direct CES‑D score or clinical interview. Wearable heart‑rate data are temporally aggregated and cannot substitute for momentary mood measures or determine causality. The participant’s subjective sleep complaints (PSQI) merit clinical attention or follow-up monitoring because subjective sleep disturbance commonly precedes or exacerbates mood symptoms even when objective sleep duration appears adequate."
78783,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of risk and protective factors for depressive symptoms. Several self-report measures and wearable-derived sleep/circadian metrics point toward increased symptom burden (notably disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, low current happiness, and elevated anxiety proneness), while other markers (high self-esteem, regular exercise and social contact, elevated interpersonal trust, and a relatively low resting heart rate) point toward resilience. Taking the pattern of associations and the relative magnitudes of the available z-scores and correlations into account, the overall signal is most consistent with depressive symptom levels near, and likely modestly above, the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES‑D scores: Several converging indicators associated with higher CES‑D are present. The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 8; Z = 0.59), a subjective marker that commonly co-occurs with greater depressive symptoms. Wearable sleep metrics show a very late median sleep start time (≈ 02:51 AM) and large night‑to‑night variability in sleep onset (SD = 173 minutes; Z = 1.99), together with elevated day‑to‑day variability in sleep duration (SD = 151 minutes; Z = 1.13); these sleep timing irregularities and variability have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (sleep‑timing SD correlation ≈ 0.22, sleep duration SD correlation ≈ 0.20) and are behavioral patterns often linked to higher depressive symptoms. Mean daily naps are relatively frequent (0.26/day; Z = 2.23) and show a positive sample correlation with CES‑D (≈ 0.21). Current self‑rated happiness is low (score = 2.0; Z = -1.61), and less happiness is moderately correlated with higher CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.46). Trait anxiety (STAI) is elevated relative to the mean (score = 43.0; Z = 0.17) and, importantly, STAI has a very strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), making it a particularly informative risk indicator in this dataset. Lower overall health satisfaction (Z ≈ -1.11) is also consistent with higher depressive symptom burden (sample correlation with CES‑D ≈ -0.39). Together, these risk markers—particularly disturbed and irregular sleep, low reported happiness, and elevated trait anxiety—provide meaningful evidence toward elevated depressive symptoms.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES‑D scores: The profile also contains several substantive protective factors associated with lower CES‑D. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg score = 39; Z = 0.11) and self‑esteem shows a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), which is a major protective signal. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07) and moderate socializing with friends (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95); both behaviors are mildly inversely correlated with CES‑D in the dataset. Interpersonal trust is relatively high (Z = 0.83; correlation with CES‑D ≈ -0.41), which tends to co‑occur with lower depressive symptoms. Wearable circadian metrics show a moderately large amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ 0.49) and an overall resting heart rate that is relatively low (RHR = 52.75 bpm; Z ≈ -0.64); several daytime heart‑rate deviations (e.g., early afternoon elevations) have small negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample, suggesting that stronger daytime physiological activation is associated with lower symptom levels. These protective features—especially high self‑esteem and active social/exercise habits—meaningfully counterbalance the risk indicators.

Holistic interpretation and relative position versus the population mean: Weighing both sides, the participant’s data present a mixed but not extreme pattern. The strongest statistical link in the dataset is between trait anxiety (STAI) and CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81); although the participant’s STAI is only modestly above the mean (Z = 0.17), that relationship increases the likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. In contrast, the participant’s very high self‑esteem (r ≈ -0.71) and regular exercise/social contacts are substantial protective signals. Multiple sleep‑related measures (subjective poor sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, high sleep variability, and increased napping), each with small-to-moderate correlations with CES‑D in the sample, tilt the balance toward higher symptom burden. Considering magnitude and convergence, the overall pattern is best characterized as near the study sample mean but tending slightly above it. Stated succinctly: relative to the study population mean CES‑D of 13.31 (SD = 9.62), the participant’s multimodal profile suggests depressive symptom levels that are near and probably modestly above the population mean.

Limitations and uncertainty: These inferences integrate population‑level correlations with the participant’s individual z‑scores but cannot substitute for a contemporaneous CES‑D self‑report or clinical assessment. Correlations reflect sample associations and do not prove causation; some wearable signals (e.g., late sleep timing and HR amplitude) can reflect lifestyle factors that are independent of mood. The strongest single predictor in this dataset (STAI) is only mildly elevated here, which increases uncertainty. For research use, the most robust conclusions are the co‑occurrence of sleep irregularity and low subjective happiness with several protective social and self‑esteem factors; together these yield a modest elevation in expected depressive symptoms relative to the cohort mean."
25197,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Several self-report measures that are robustly associated with higher CES-D scores are elevated for this participant. Trait anxiety on the STAI is high (score 50, Z = 0.86) and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.82); this is one of the clearest signals in the dataset that aligns with elevated depressive symptomatology. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92), and subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7, above the common clinical cutoff), both of which are associated with higher depressive symptoms in the literature and in the sample-level correlations included here. The participant reports lower momentary happiness (Current = 3.0, Z = -0.53, sample correlation with CES-D r = -0.46), which further aligns with greater depressive symptoms. Behavioral indicators that can be risk factors—late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:45 AM), relatively short median nightly sleep duration (6 h 34 min, Z = -0.77), low frequency of organized sports and only 1–2 exercise sessions per week—also map onto profiles that tend to accompany elevated depressive symptoms.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Several measures point in the opposite direction, suggesting resilience or lower depressive burden. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Z ≈ 0.82) and, in the sample, self‑esteem has a strong negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), a notable protective factor. Overall health satisfaction is substantially above the sample mean (Z = 1.63) and relates negatively to CES-D (r ≈ -0.39), which is protective. Objective physiological markers from the wearable also show features typically associated with good autonomic/cardiorespiratory functioning: a relatively low resting heart rate (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68) and a clear nocturnal heart‑rate nadir (large negative deviations from the mesor overnight) suggest intact nocturnal recovery. The cosinor-derived amplitude is above average (amplitude Z = 0.64) and several daytime heart‑rate deviations—most notably a very pronounced mid‑afternoon elevation (3–4 pm deviation = +38.3, Z = 5.3) and increased activity in the early–late afternoon—are negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample (small negative correlations for afternoon hours). Lower intradaily variability (Z = -0.53) and near-average interdaily stability (Z ≈ 0.09) indicate reasonably regular circadian patterning rather than the fragmentation often linked with depression.

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement relative to the study sample
- The dataset presents a mixed pattern: strong psychological risk signals (particularly elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress, plus disturbed subjective sleep and reduced momentary happiness) co-occur with meaningful protective signals (higher self‑esteem, high health satisfaction, low resting heart rate, robust daytime activity/afternoon physiological activation, and overall circadian regularity). Because trait anxiety has a very large sample correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.82), the participant’s elevated STAI score is an important indicator that would push an inferred CES‑D estimate upward. Conversely, the participant’s above‑average self‑esteem (a strong negative correlate of CES‑D) and physiological markers of daytime engagement and nocturnal recovery are substantial countervailing signals.

- Weighing these signals together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is near the study population mean, with some indication toward being modestly above the mean driven primarily by high trait anxiety, elevated stress, and subjective sleep disturbance. Expressed relative to the study summary (population mean CES‑D = 13.32, SD = 9.62), the pattern would most plausibly place the participant close to the mean CES‑D; if there is deviation, the psychological self‑report risk indicators (particularly STAI and PSQI) make a slight elevation above the population mean more likely than a clear reduction below it.

Key caveats
- These conclusions integrate correlational associations and mixed modality signals and do not constitute a clinical diagnosis. Some survey values (e.g., the self‑esteem raw score reported) appear inconsistent with stated scale ranges but the provided Z‑score and correlation values were used to interpret relative standing. Wearable-derived metrics are aggregated across days and reflect typical patterns rather than day‑to‑day variability. Given the mixed evidence, targeted clinical or longitudinal assessment (including a direct CES‑D score if available, and follow‑up on anxiety and sleep complaints) would reduce uncertainty and clarify whether the slight elevation inferred here represents transient stress/anxiety or a more persistent depressive symptom burden."
23270,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals. Trait anxiety (STAI = 47, z = 0.56) is elevated and strongly correlated with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.82). At the same time the participant reports comparatively high self-esteem (RSES = 37, z = −0.17), good subjective sleep (PSQI = 4, z = −1.26), low perceived stress (PSS z = −0.71), high current happiness (z = 0.55), frequent exercise (exercising alone and sports with z-scores > 1 in places), minimal substance use, and strong academic performance. Wearable-derived physiology shows a generally intact diurnal heart rate rhythm (amplitude near the sample mean, acrophase ~2:42 PM) with low resting heart rate (54.9 bpm, z = −0.39) and longer-than-average nightly sleep (median 8 h 49 min, z = 2.03). Nonparametric circadian measures are only modestly perturbed (interdaily stability slightly below mean, z = −0.24; intradaily variability slightly elevated, z = 0.39). Taken together, these data indicate both risk-related and protective features with no single modality strongly dominating.

Features consistent with higher depressive symptom burden: The clearest signal pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms is trait anxiety: the STAI score is elevated and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r = 0.82), so this instrument increases the likelihood of higher depressive symptom reporting in this individual. Wearable-derived fragmentation of circadian activity (intradaily variability z = 0.39) and slightly reduced interdaily stability (z = −0.24) are modestly consistent with patterns sometimes seen in affective disturbance (more fragmented daily physiology), although these deviations are small. Behavioral indicators that can be associated with risk — relatively limited reported time socializing (16–30 minutes, z = −1.41) and many “do not do” responses for sedentary/leisure hobbies — could reflect lower social/leisure engagement, a feature that sometimes accompanies higher depressive symptom scores (but note that correlations for these specific items with CES-D are small in the sample).

Features consistent with lower depressive symptom burden: Multiple robust protective signals are present. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 37), and that measure is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D in the study (r = −0.71), which is a substantive protective factor. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, z = −1.26) and wearable data show regular, long nightly sleep (median ~8 h 49 min, z = 2.03) with low daytime napping, arguing against sleep disturbance as a driver of depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is lower than average (z = −0.71) and current happiness is above average (z = 0.55). Frequent exercise (several items with z > 1) and minimal substance use are additional behavioral factors that typically associate with lower CES-D scores. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate and a preserved diurnal heart rate pattern (normal amplitude and a clear daytime peak) do not suggest marked autonomic dysregulation that often accompanies higher depressive burden.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study sample mean: Balancing the strong risk signal from elevated trait anxiety against several strong protective signals (high self-esteem, good subjective and objective sleep patterns, low stress, regular exercise, and minimal substance use), the overall pattern is mixed but leans away from a pronounced depressive profile. On balance, the data are most consistent with depressive symptomatology near the study sample mean CES-D score rather than clearly above it; if forced to specify directionality, the aggregate evidence more closely aligns with “near the mean” (rather than clearly above or well below). This inference emphasizes that anxiety-related risk is present and warrants attention, but several protective factors make a markedly elevated CES-D score less likely based on the available multimodal data.

Limitations: No direct CES-D score for the participant was provided in the dataset, so this synthesis is inferential and relies on trait/behavioral correlates and circadian/physiological proxies. Correlations reported from the sample guide interpretation but do not deterministically map one individual’s score. Clinical interpretation should incorporate a direct depressive symptom measure and clinical interview where indicated."
70125,"Summary and overall comparison to the study sample
Taken together, the multimodal profile contains a mix of risk and protective signals for depressive symptoms but leans toward an elevation relative to the study population. Several high-risk indicators that are strongly associated with CES-D in this sample (notably trait anxiety and perceived stress) are pronounced for this participant, while important protective factors (notably high self‑esteem and some markers of physical fitness) are also present. Using the study sample context (population CES‑D mean = 13.28, SD = 9.61; median = 11.0), the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the population mean; the precise CES‑D score cannot be determined from these data alone, but the participant’s profile points to a moderate elevation in depressive symptoms relative to peers.

Features consistent with relatively higher depressive symptomatology
Several self-report measures that show strong positive relations with CES‑D are elevated. Trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86) is notably above average and, in this dataset, has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81), which makes it one of the most salient indicators of greater depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is very high (PSS = 29, z = 2.01), and stress is positively associated with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.28), reinforcing the inference of elevated symptom burden. Subjective sleep difficulty (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep) and objectively large night‑to‑night sleep variability (sleep duration SD = 159 minutes, z = 1.32) are additional risk factors: disturbed/irregular sleep has modest positive correlations with CES‑D here and is a well‑established correlate of depressive symptoms. Low interpersonal trust (score = 2.33, z = -1.74; r with CES‑D ≈ -0.41) and relatively low overall satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction z = -0.95; r ≈ -0.39) further align with higher CES‑D scores in this sample. Wearable circadian measures show reduced regularity (interdaily stability = 0.34, z = -0.57; 24‑hour autocorrelation = 0.24, z = -0.70) and a comparatively low amplitude (9.18, z = -0.52), which together suggest blunted/less stable daily physiological rhythms — patterns that are modestly associated with depressive symptoms in the dataset and that are consistent with the participant’s late and variable sleep schedule (median sleep start ~01:44, start‑time SD ≈ 99 minutes).

Features consistent with relatively lower depressive symptomatology
There are several protective features that point away from severe depressive symptomatology. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39 of 40, z ≈ 0.11) and has a strong negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ -0.71); this is a substantial buffer against depressive symptoms. Self‑reported current happiness is above average (score = 4.0, z = 0.55; r ≈ -0.46), which also predicts lower CES‑D scores. Objective physiological markers that typically index cardiovascular fitness or lower physiological stress are favorable: resting heart rate is low (53 bpm, z = -0.61), and many daytime heart rate aggregates are modestly elevated in the afternoon/evening as expected for diurnal activity (acrophase ~5:03 PM). Regular solitary exercise is relatively frequent (exercising alone three times per week or more, z = 1.07), and physical activity has a small inverse association with CES‑D in this dataset. Alcohol and recreational drug use are not elevated (beer/wine moderate; no recreational/non‑prescribed drug use), which does not add to depressive risk here.

Integrated interpretation and behavioral implications
Weighing the relative magnitude and reliability of predictors in this dataset, the strongest single signals favoring higher depressive symptoms are elevated trait anxiety (high STAI) and very high perceived stress; both measures have substantial correlations with CES‑D in the sample and are well above the study mean. Secondary contributors to higher symptom risk include disturbed and irregular sleep timing and low interpersonal trust. Conversely, high self‑esteem, moderate happiness, frequent exercise, and a low resting heart rate are meaningful protective features that reduce the likelihood of very high CES‑D scores. Overall, the preponderance of evidence supports an inference of depressive symptoms above the study population mean, though the presence of robust protective factors makes severe elevation less certain.

If the goal is monitoring or targeting behaviors associated with CES‑D in future assessment or intervention, the most salient targets suggested by these data are anxiety and stress management (given the high STAI and PSS), and stabilizing sleep timing and reducing night‑to‑night sleep variability (given the late median sleep onset and high sleep SD). These targets are aligned both with the strongest correlates of CES‑D in the dataset and with the participant’s concrete behavioral patterns."
67192,"Summary of indicators consistent with elevated depressive symptoms:
Several self-report measures that show relatively strong statistical relationships with CES-D in this sample are elevated in this participant. Trait anxiety (STAI = 58, Z = +1.65; STAI–CES-D correlation = +0.81) and perceived stress (PSS = 31, Z = +2.55; corr = +0.27) are both high, which—given their sample correlations—are among the strongest predictors in the dataset of higher depressive symptomatology. Self‑esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 33, Z = −0.73; corr = −0.71), and current self‑rated happiness is low (score = 2, Z = −1.61; corr = −0.46); both of these are also robustly associated with higher CES-D scores in the study. Low interpersonal trust (Z = −2.39; corr = −0.40) and low health satisfaction (Z = −2.03; corr = −0.39) further align with the pattern of elevated depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7), and the PSQI is often linked to higher depressive symptoms; although objective sleep duration is near the sample mean, the participant reports poorer sleep. Taken together, the combination of high anxiety and stress, lower self‑esteem and happiness, and multiple indices of poor subjective well‑being provide convergent evidence that the participant’s CES-D score is likely above the population mean.

Physiological and behavioral signals that support heightened symptom burden:
Wearable-derived physiology shows features consistent with increased physiological arousal. Resting heart rate is elevated (71.8 bpm; Z = +1.62; corr = +0.18) and MESOR (mean fitted heart rate) is high (88.7; Z = +2.01; corr = +0.18), which, in this sample, have small positive associations with CES‑D and are consistent with an autonomic profile that can accompany affective distress. Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced evening and late-night heart rate elevations relative to mesor (notably 10–11 pm and 11 pm–12 am with high Z-scores), which may reflect evening physiological activation or arousal; some of these evening hours (e.g., 10–11 pm, Z = +1.55) align with times of elevated heart rate and could relate to stress/anxiety-driven activation. Sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep start ~01:15 AM; sleep start SD ≈ 110 min; Z = +0.59), and sleep timing variability has a modest positive correlation with CES‑D in the dataset (corr ≈ +0.21). These wearable signals therefore provide additional, if moderate, evidence toward a higher depressive symptom level.

Factors and metrics that point toward lower depressive symptoms or resilience:
There are several behavioral and circadian features that argue against a uniformly high symptom burden. Objective median sleep duration is approximately 7 h 16 min (Z ≈ +0.10), within a typical range and not suggestive of gross sleep loss; mean daily naps are infrequent (0.13/day, Z = +0.70). Circadian regularity measures from heart rate are not strongly disrupted: interdaily stability is above average (0.52, Z = +0.91) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (Z = +1.23), indicating fairly consistent day-to-day structure in activity/physiology—features that in many studies relate to lower depressive risk (here correlations with CES‑D are small or negligible). Socializing time is relatively high (more than 4 hours daily; Z = +2.53), and frequency of exercise is low-to-moderate rather than absent; low substance use is also present. These social and behavioral resources provide countervailing evidence that some protective factors are present and could buffer symptom severity.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the sample mean:
Weighing the evidence, the strongest single indicators in this dataset that predict higher CES‑D are the very elevated trait anxiety (STAI), markedly elevated perceived stress, and reduced self‑esteem and happiness—measures that show the largest correlations with CES‑D in the sample. Physiological arousal (elevated resting HR and MESOR) and disturbed subjective sleep add convergent support. Countervailing evidence—reasonable objective sleep duration, preserved day‑to‑day circadian regularity, frequent socializing, and low substance use—moderates but does not fully offset the weight of the risk indicators. On balance, the multimodal profile is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.26). This conclusion is probabilistic and based on the constellation and relative strengths of measures and their sample correlations rather than a direct CES‑D score; it should be interpreted as indicating a higher-than-average symptom burden within this cohort, but not as a clinical diagnosis."
97448,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile contains a mixture of signals, but the balance of objective and self-report measures points toward a relatively modest level of depressive symptoms compared with the study sample. Key protective features include low trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem, consistent and sufficient sleep duration, regular circadian structure in heart rate, low resting heart rate, regular exercise frequency, and preserved academic performance. Countervailing signals include a PSQI score indicating some subjective sleep disturbance, a late habitual sleep onset (median ~01:44 AM), somewhat lower self-reported current happiness, and a small tendency to nap; these features suggest mild, situational symptoms for which some sleep-related factors may be relevant.

Evidence consistent with higher depressive symptoms: The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 6, above the common clinical cutoff of 5), which commonly co-occurs with elevated depressive symptoms (PSQI classification: “Disturbed Sleep”). Self-reported current happiness is below the sample mean (happy: 3.0, z ≈ -0.53) and correlates negatively with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.46), indicating lower momentary positive affect that maps onto higher depressive symptom scores. Mean daily naps (0.13/day, z = 0.7) and modest associations between sleep irregularity measures and CES-D (sleep SD correlations ~0.19–0.21) also point to sleep-related behaviors that have small positive associations with CES-D in the sample. Finally, while perceived stress is not high in absolute terms, it is moderately correlated with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.28), so the participant’s stress score (20, z ≈ -0.44) could still interact with other risk factors.

Evidence consistent with lower depressive symptoms: Several robust indicators point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety is comparatively low (STAI = 33, z ≈ -0.82, classified “not anxious”), and STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.81), so low anxiety is a strongly protective factor. Self-esteem is above average (Rosenberg, z ≈ 0.4) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), another strong protective marker. Objective sleep quantity and stability are favorable: median wearable sleep duration is ~7 h 12 min (z ≈ 0.02) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep SD z ≈ -0.86), and mean daily nap use is low. Circadian rhythm derived from heart rate is regular and robust — interdaily stability is high (z ≈ 1.0), amplitude is relatively large (z ≈ 1.29), acrophase is in the late afternoon (5:00 PM), and intradaily variability is near the sample mean — overall indicating a well-entrained and structured rhythm, which in the sample tends to be associated with lower depressive symptoms (amplitude and stability show small negative correlations with CES-D). Resting heart rate is lower than average (50.8 bpm, z ≈ -0.87), and the participant engages in exercise alone three times per week or more (z ≈ 1.07), both of which are modestly associated with lower CES-D scores in the sample. Academic functioning (GPAs) is high, which provides additional indirect evidence of preserved motivational and functional capacity.

Integrated conclusion and comparison to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s profile contains a few signals consistent with mild symptomatology (subjective sleep disturbance, late sleep timing, reduced momentary happiness), but more numerous and stronger protective indicators (low trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, stable and adequate objective sleep, robust circadian structure, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, preserved academic functioning). On balance, the data suggest the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely below the study sample mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.34, SD = 9.61). The profile is therefore most consistent with depressive symptomatology that is at most mild and likely lower than the average level observed in the cohort, rather than substantially elevated."
67177,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of psychosocial risk factors and preserved physiological rhythm. Self-report measures indicate elevated anxiety proneness (STAI = 46, z = 0.46), reduced self-esteem (RSES = 31, z = −1.01), low current happiness (self-rated = 2.0, z = −1.61), elevated perceived stress (PSS = 25, z = 0.92), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and low interpersonal trust (z = −1.10). Several of these self-report measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES‑D score in this sample (notably STAI r = 0.81 and self‑esteem r = −0.71), which together point toward an elevated level of depressive symptomatology. Objective wearable data, by contrast, show relatively regular and consolidated circadian physiology (high interdaily stability z = 1.24, high 24‑hour autocorrelation z = 1.40, relatively low intradaily variability z = −0.74) and a median nightly sleep duration near 7 hours (6 h 54 m, z = −0.35), features that are generally protective against depressive symptoms.

Factors that indicate a relatively higher CES-D level: The strongest signals consistent with higher depressive symptoms come from trait and state self-report. Elevated trait anxiety (STAI) is strongly associated with higher CES‑D in this dataset (r = 0.81) and the participant’s STAI score is above the cohort mean. Low self‑esteem (RSES) is also a strong predictor here (r = −0.71) and the participant’s score is approximately one SD below the sample mean, a meaningful risk signal. Low current happiness (z = −1.61) and elevated perceived stress (z = 0.92) further support increased risk; both map in this sample to higher CES‑D scores (happiness r = −0.46, stress r = 0.28). Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, above the common clinical cutoff of 5) and low health satisfaction (z = −1.2, correlation with CES‑D r ≈ −0.39) are additional contributors. Behavioral indicators—minimal exercise (exercised alone and with others “not at all,” z scores around −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (z ≈ −0.62), and reduced trust (z ≈ −1.1)—are consistent with patterns that often accompany higher depressive symptoms in this sample.

Factors that indicate a relatively lower CES-D level: Several wearable-derived circadian measures suggest preserved daily structure, which tends to be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are elevated (z = 1.24 and 1.40), and intradaily variability is below average (z = −0.74), indicating a consistent, consolidated rhythm of heart‑rate activity across days. Median sleep duration is close to seven hours and mean daily naps are essentially absent (z = −0.86), which are not strong drivers toward higher CES‑D here. Heart‑rate amplitude and acrophase are within sample ranges (amplitude z ≈ 0.82, acrophase ~4:34 PM), and while the participant’s mesor and resting heart rate are somewhat elevated (mesor z = 1.11; RHR z = 0.84), associations between these specific circadian parameters and CES‑D in the sample are weak-to-modest (correlations near zero to small positive/negative values).

Physiological and sleep nuance: Objective and subjective sleep metrics diverge slightly—the participant reports disturbed sleep (PSQI > 5) despite a median objective duration close to seven hours. Sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ~00:22) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (start time SD ≈ 87 minutes). Some wearable metrics that index rhythm regularity (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high autocorrelation) suggest preserved daily rhythm which can be protective; however, modestly elevated resting heart rate and mesor (both z ≈ 0.8–1.1) may reflect physiological arousal consistent with the elevated anxiety and stress reported, and these heart-rate measures have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample.

Behavioral and contextual considerations: The participant reports little to no exercise, low social engagement, and high sedentary/media time (watching 1–2 hours daily, internet/music use elevated), patterns associated in the literature and in these sample correlations with greater depressive symptoms. Academic performance history shows a recent notable decline (one term GPA 1.9) which could reflect or contribute to current distress and stress levels. Conversely, absence of substance use and lack of daytime napping may mitigate some behavioral risk.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to sample mean: Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most predictive signals in this dataset are the elevated trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES‑D), low self‑esteem (strong negative correlate), low current happiness, and elevated perceived stress and subjective sleep disturbance. These psychosocial and subjective symptom signals outweigh the protective pattern of preserved circadian regularity and near‑normal objective sleep duration. Taken together, the pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.3). In other words, the participant’s profile suggests CES‑D levels that are likely above the sample average, reflecting a mix of clinically relevant distress and some preserved physiological rhythm."
87328,"Protective indicators consistent with relatively low depressive symptoms
Several strong self-report signals point toward lower-than-average depressive symptoms for this participant. Trait anxiety is substantially low (STAI score 23; Z = -1.81) and this measure is highly positively associated with CES‑D in the study sample (r ≈ 0.81), so a low STAI score is a powerful protective signal. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg RSES Z = +1.66) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), which also argues for fewer depressive symptoms. Current self‑reported happiness is elevated (Z = +1.64) and perceived stress is low (PSS Z = -1.80); both of these map onto the CES‑D in directions that reduce the likelihood of elevated depressive symptomatology. Behavioral and lifestyle factors further support this interpretation: the participant reports frequent socializing (social time Z = +2.53), negligible substance use, reasonably high academic performance (GPAs in the high 3.8–3.92 range), and some organized sports activity (sports Z = +0.91). Together, these psychosocial and behavioral markers constitute multiple, convergent indicators that the participant’s CES‑D level is likely below the study population mean.

Risk indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
There are also several indicators that pull in the opposite direction and could raise risk for depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality on the PSQI is above the common clinical threshold (PSQI = 7; classified as “disturbed sleep”), which in many samples is associated with higher CES‑D scores. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 01:26 AM), and although sleep duration is adequate on average, late circadian timing has been linked in prior work to worse mood for some individuals. Self‑reported health satisfaction is relatively low (health satisfaction Z ≈ -1.2), and sedentary recreational behaviors (high TV/video time, Z ≈ +2.54; heavy music listening Z ≈ +1.6) may reflect or reinforce low subjective health or low activation for some people. BMI is in the overweight range (27.1), which can be associated with poorer health perceptions. These factors are comparatively weaker (smaller correlations with CES‑D or smaller Z‑scores) than the strongest protective signals noted above, but they nonetheless represent plausible contributors to elevated symptomatology for this participant.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian evidence
Physiological data from the wearable indicate a robust, regular circadian profile that tends to be associated with lower depressive symptoms. Heart‑rate cosinor parameters show a relatively large amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ +1.78), an elevated 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ +1.57), and above‑average interdaily stability (Z ≈ +1.0), all suggesting reliable day–night structure in cardiovascular activity across the recording period. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.4 bpm; Z ≈ -0.45), and the hourly aggregated deviations show clear nocturnal declines and pronounced daytime/evening peaks (notably a large evening positive deviation around 6–7 PM, Z ≈ +2.62). These patterns indicate preserved physiological day–night regulation and regularity—characteristics that correlate with lower CES‑D in this sample (amplitude and stability show small negative or near‑zero correlations with CES‑D). Sleep quantity from wearables (median ~7 h 25 min; Z ≈ +0.3) is adequate and sleep timing variability is low (sleep start SD Z ≈ -0.72), which are additional physiological markers more consistent with lower depressive symptoms than with higher.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean
Weighing all modalities, the preponderance of evidence (very low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, high current happiness, low perceived stress, strong social engagement, and robust, regular physiological circadian rhythms) points toward an overall depressive symptom level below the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.34; median = 11.5). Some adverse signals—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), late sleep timing, lower health satisfaction, and sedentary media use—moderate this conclusion but appear to be weaker or less consistent contributors in the present multimodal profile. On balance, it is most consistent to infer that this participant’s CES‑D is below the sample mean and plausibly in the lower half of the distribution (i.e., at or below the sample median), although the exact CES‑D score cannot be determined from these auxiliary measures alone.

Caveats
These inferences synthesize cross‑sectional self‑report and aggregated wearable indicators and rest on known correlations within the study sample; they do not constitute a clinical diagnosis. Individual trajectories, context, or unmeasured stressors could alter symptom levels, and subjective measures (e.g., PSQI, health satisfaction) merit attention despite the overall protective pattern."
49497,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mixture of strong risk indicators for elevated depressive symptoms and a smaller set of moderating or neutral features. Taken together, the most salient signals—particularly very high trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, disturbed subjective sleep, circadian irregularity on wearable measures, elevated perceived stress, low self-reported happiness, limited socializing, and high recreational/non-prescribed drug use—point toward a level of depressive symptoms that is likely above the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.21). Below I summarize the evidence that supports relatively higher versus relatively lower depressive symptomatology and then provide an integrated conclusion.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms: Several strong and consistent indicators in the dataset are associated with higher CES‑D scores. Trait anxiety is markedly elevated (STAI = 64, z = 2.24) and this measure has a high positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the clearest risk signals. Self‑esteem is notably low (RSES = 22, z = −2.28) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.70), another potent risk marker. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep), and wearable-derived sleep shows short median sleep (6 h 30 min, z = −0.85) plus high night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD = 204 min, z = 2.65; sleep duration SD = 148 min, z = 1.06), all of which are commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms. Circadian/rhythm measures from the wearable further indicate instability and blunting of daily rhythm: low interdaily stability (0.21, z = −1.65), reduced amplitude (5.95, z = −1.56), low 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.20, z = −1.03), and moderately elevated intradaily variability (0.63, z = 0.60). These features together describe an irregular and lower‑amplitude heart‑rate rhythm that has been linked to mood symptoms. Self‑reported stress is elevated (PSS = 24, z = 0.65; r with CES‑D = 0.28) and current happiness is low (score = 2.0, z = −1.61; r = −0.45), both consistent with increased depressive symptom burden. Behaviorally, the participant reports limited time socializing with friends (16–30 minutes, z = −1.41) and comparatively large recreational and non‑prescribed drug use (extremely high z‑scores relative to this sample), which, while their sample correlations with CES‑D are small, are clinically relevant patterns that can co-occur with and exacerbate depressive symptoms. Collectively these elements—especially the very large STAI and low self‑esteem with strong sample correlations to CES‑D—are the strongest evidence supporting a level of depressive symptoms above the sample mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower or mitigating depressive symptoms: Several features temper the case for very high depressive severity. Objective cardiovascular baseline measures are near the sample mean (resting HR 60.6 bpm, MESOR ~75.6, both small positive z‑scores), indicating no marked autonomic hyperarousal at rest. The participant engages in regular exercise (alone, three times a week or more; z = 1.07), which is generally protective against depressive symptoms (though exercising with others is absent). Mean daily naps are minimal (0.07, near sample mean), and some daytime heart‑rate deviations show clear morning activity peaks (e.g., large positive deviations 9–11am), which indicate periods of normal daytime engagement and routine activity. Academic performance (GPAs listed across terms) is generally good. Health satisfaction is modestly positive (score = 5/7, z ≈ 0.55) and may reflect a retained sense of physical well‑being. These factors suggest the participant retains functional routines and some protective behaviors that could moderate symptom severity.

Integrated conclusion relative to the study population: On balance, the profile contains multiple strong indicators of elevated depressive symptoms—especially very high trait anxiety and low self‑esteem, together with sleep disturbance, circadian irregularity, increased perceived stress, low reported happiness, reduced social contact, and notable substance use. Given the magnitude and direction of these signals (and the high correlations of several of them with CES‑D in this sample), the participant’s overall depressive-symptom level is most consistent with being above the study population mean CES‑D score of 13.21. This inference is probabilistic: it is supported by convergent behavioral and physiological markers but is not a diagnostic statement and would be strengthened by an actual CES‑D score or clinical interview."
33785,"Summary of self-report indicators:
The participant’s survey profile contains several self-report signals that are strongly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI = 56, Z = 1.45) is markedly elevated relative to the sample and has a very large positive correlation with CES-D in this dataset (r = 0.81), which makes it one of the most potent indicators pointing toward higher depressive symptom burden. Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D (r = -0.71), also supporting greater risk. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 7) is in the “disturbed sleep” range (above the common clinical cutpoint of 5) and therefore aligns with depressive symptomatology. By contrast, perceived stress is lower than the sample mean (PSS score = 19, Z = -0.71), and current self-reported happiness is modestly above average (Z = 0.55); both of these features, insofar as their modest correlations with CES-D are concerned, would tend to reduce the likelihood of a high CES-D score.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
Behavioral habits show a mixture of protective and risk-related elements. The participant reports regular solitary exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.07), which tends to be protective against depressive symptoms (correlation here modestly negative). Social exercise is infrequent and the participant reports above-average time in sedentary hobbies and video gaming (sedentary hobby Z = 2.01, video games Z = 2.47); these leisure patterns are weakly associated in this sample with higher CES-D and may reflect less engagement in socially reinforcing activities. Substance use is minimal and recreational drug use is reported as none, which is a protective behavioral feature. Overall, lifestyle data present a mixed picture: regular physical activity and low substance use are protective, while high solitary/sedentary leisure time and lower social exercise may modestly increase risk.

Wearable physiology, sleep timing, and circadian metrics:
Objective wearable data indicate generally regular and robust circadian structure. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.48, Z = 0.58) and 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z = 1.06), while intradaily variability is low (Z = -2.08), indicating a stable, well-structured daily rhythm with low fragmentation. Resting heart rate and MESOR are near-sample average (resting HR 58.7 bpm, MESOR ~76.8 bpm), and amplitude is moderately above average (Z = 0.54) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:49 PM); collectively these are not strongly indicative of dysregulated physiology. Objective sleep metrics are also not strongly adverse: median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 20 min (Z = 0.18) and bedtimes are reasonably consistent (sleep start SD Z = -0.75). The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions and daytime elevations; correlations of these heart-rate features with CES-D in this sample are small. In sum, wearable physiology and objective sleep timing largely reflect preserved circadian regularity and sufficient sleep duration, which are features associated with lower depressive symptom burden.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample:
Weighing the evidence across modalities yields a mixed but coherent picture. The strongest, most predictive self-report signals for elevated depressive symptoms are high trait anxiety and relatively low self-esteem—both of which have large sample correlations with CES-D and are meaningfully displaced from the sample mean. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) and behavioral patterns that include high sedentary/video-game time add modest additional risk. Countervailing evidence includes lower perceived stress, above-average current happiness, frequent solitary exercise, minimal substance use, consistent objective sleep timing, and robust circadian regularity from wearable data—all features that typically associate with lower CES-D or buffer depressive symptoms.

On balance, given the particularly strong predictive weight of trait anxiety and low self-esteem in this dataset, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms that is above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.27). That conclusion is tempered by multiple protective factors (objective sleep regularity, sufficient sleep duration, regular exercise, and low substance use) which suggest that the elevation is unlikely to be extreme; a modest-to-moderate elevation above the sample mean is the most consistent interpretation. Note that this is an inferential synthesis across correlated indicators rather than a direct CES-D measurement for the individual, and conclusions would be strengthened by the participant’s actual CES-D score and by longitudinal symptom data."
33009,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile contains a mixture of protective and risk-relevant signals for depressive symptomatology. On balance, the evidence points toward depressive symptom levels that are likely near or slightly below the study sample’s mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.32). Several robust protective features (notably maximal self‑esteem and relatively low self‑reported stress) argue against a high CES‑D, while a cluster of sleep/circadian irregularities and lower momentary well‑being (lower reported happiness and interpersonal trust) provide countervailing risk signals. Below I summarize the patterns that push in each direction and then integrate them into a holistic interpretation.

Features that indicate relatively higher depressive symptom risk
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The PSQI score is 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which is above common clinical cutoffs and is a well‑established correlate of higher depressive symptoms. This subjective report diverges from wearable duration data and suggests sleep quality complaints despite sufficient sleep time.  
- Circadian rhythm blunting and irregularity: Wearable-derived circadian features show a reduced amplitude (amplitude = 7.95, Z = -0.92) and lower interdaily stability (0.35, Z = -0.49), together with reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = -0.45). A lower amplitude and reduced day‑to‑day regularity of heart‑rate rhythms are commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms in the literature, and these metrics here represent moderate deviations below the study mean.  
- Intradaily fragmentation: Intradaily variability is elevated (0.62, Z = 0.53), consistent with more fragmented or less consolidated activity/physiological states across the day — another feature that has been associated with depressive symptomatology in population studies.  
- Lower momentary well‑being and social trust: Self‑reported current happiness is lower than the study mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and interpersonal trust is reduced (score = 3.0, Z = -0.46). Both lower positive affect/happiness and lower social trust typically track with higher depressive symptoms.  
- Late sleep timing: Median sleep start around 00:51 indicates a relatively late sleep phase. Late timing can relate to mood symptoms in some individuals and may interact with the blunted circadian amplitude described above.

Features that indicate relatively lower depressive symptom risk
- High trait self‑esteem: The participant scored at the top of the Rosenberg self‑esteem scale (score = 40, Z = 0.26). Self‑esteem here is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in the sample (r = -0.71), making this one of the strongest protective signals in the dataset.  
- Lower perceived stress: The Perceived Stress score is 19 with a Z = -0.71 (lower than the sample mean). Lower perceived stress is associated with lower depressive symptoms and therefore reduces the likelihood of a high CES‑D.  
- Adequate and stable sleep duration: Wearable sleep shows a median nightly duration of 7 h 54 min (Z = 0.89) and a low night‑to‑night duration standard deviation (55 min, Z = -1.03). The combination of sufficient total sleep time and low variability in duration is typically protective against mood disturbance despite subjective complaints about sleep quality.  
- Behavioral engagement and functioning: The participant reports regular socializing (1–2 hours), moderate exercise frequency (1–2 times/week alone and with others), and strong academic performance (GPAs consistently high). These behavioral markers and functional indices frequently align with lower depressive symptom burden.  
- Resting heart rate and mesor: Resting HR is near the study mean (58.1 bpm, Z = -0.01) and the MESOR value is lower than average (MESOR = 68.76, Z = -0.71). While some heart‑rate features can portend risk, a low resting HR and lower MESOR do not provide a clear signal of elevated depressive symptoms in this context; MESOR in this sample correlates only modestly with CES‑D (r = 0.19).

Integrated interpretation and comparison to population mean
Putting these elements together, the dataset contains several notable protective factors (especially maximal self‑esteem, relatively low perceived stress, stable and sufficient sleep duration, social and academic functioning) that reduce the likelihood of a substantially elevated CES‑D. Counterbalancing these are subjective sleep disturbance, blunted circadian amplitude, lowered day‑to‑day rhythm stability and elevated intradaily variability, and modest reductions in momentary happiness and interpersonal trust — factors that increase vulnerability for depressive symptoms. Given the relative magnitude of the signals (very strong protective association for self‑esteem; moderate risk signals in circadian metrics and subjective sleep), the most likely placement of this participant’s depressive symptom level is near or slightly below the study sample mean (i.e., at or a bit under the population mean CES‑D of 13.32), rather than well above it.

Implications and caveats
- The mismatch between objective sleep duration (adequate, stable) and subjective sleep quality (PSQI > 5) is clinically informative: it suggests complaints about sleep quality or continuity not captured by duration alone and may merit targeted assessment (e.g., sleep fragmentation, insomnia symptoms, or sleep‑related worry).  
- Circadian blunting and intraday fragmentation could represent modifiable targets (behavioral scheduling, light exposure, activity structuring) that may reduce mood risk even when global CES‑D is not high.  
- Strong protective features (particularly high self‑esteem and low perceived stress) temper risk estimates; however, the presence of multiple circadian and subjective sleep signals means monitoring would be prudent, especially if subjective happiness or trust deteriorates or if sleep complaints persist.

Limitations: This interpretation integrates cross‑sectional wearable aggregates, trait questionnaires, and single‑time self‑reports; it does not replace repeated clinical assessment or a direct CES‑D score. Correlations reported are sample‑level associations and do not determine causality for this individual."
96184,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptomatology:
Multiple convergent signals in the wearable and survey data point toward features that are empirically associated with higher CES‑D scores. Sleep is the most notable: median nightly sleep duration is very short (5 h 27 min; Z = −2.16) and night-to-night variability in duration is extremely large (SD = 359 minutes; Z = 5.88). The participant’s typical sleep onset is very late (median start ≈ 04:42) and highly inconsistent (sleep‑start SD = 422 minutes; Z = 7.44). Subjective sleep quality is also disturbed (PSQI = 7, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”). Irregular and blunted circadian organization in heart‑rate–derived metrics reinforces this picture: low interdaily stability (0.22; Z = −1.56), very low 24‑hr autocorrelation (0.11; Z = −1.79), and a reduced rhythm amplitude (6.21; Z = −1.48). These objective irregularities and the poor, highly variable sleep pattern are established correlates of increased depressive symptoms. Additional survey indicators align with higher symptoms: perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38, positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample), current self‑reported happiness is below the sample mean (Current Happy = 3.0; Z = −0.53, negative correlation with CES‑D), and some wearable-derived nap frequency and sleep variability measures have modest positive correlations with CES‑D (e.g., sleep duration SD correlation ≈ 0.24, mean daily naps correlation ≈ 0.21). Reduced social engagement and physical activity (socializing 16–30 minutes; Z = −1.41; exercise 1–2×/month) are behavioral patterns that, in aggregate, are also commonly associated with higher depressive symptom levels.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptomatology:
There are several protective or countervailing signals. The participant reports high self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 40, Z = 0.26), a variable but meaningful protective correlate given the strong negative sample correlation between self‑esteem and CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71). Academic performance is strong (GPAs in the mid‑3s), which may reflect preserved cognitive/functional capacity and coping in academic domains. Health satisfaction is near the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.05) and resting heart rate and mesor are modestly lower than the sample mean (resting HR = 55.5, mesor = 66.6; Zs ≈ −0.32 and −1.0) — lower resting heart rates are not themselves diagnostic but here argue against marked peripheral hyperarousal. Substance use is minimal (beer/wine/drugs reported “not at all”), which reduces risk introduced by substance‑related exacerbation of mood symptoms. Certain behaviors associated with elevated CES‑D in this sample (e.g., listening to music, internet use) are present but not extreme; they should be interpreted in the broader context of the strong sleep–circadian signals.

Specific interpretation of wearable circadian and heart‑rate features:
The cosinor and non‑parametric circadian features point to a blunted, poorly entrained activity/physiology rhythm. Low interdaily stability and low autocorrelation at 24 hours indicate inconsistent daily timing of physiological activity across days; reduced amplitude indicates smaller day–night differences in mean heart rate. Together with the very late and highly variable sleep onsets, these features are most consistent with a pattern of circadian misalignment/irregularity. In clinical and epidemiological studies this pattern is frequently associated with elevated depressive symptoms, especially when accompanied by short total sleep time and high variability. Hourly aggregated deviations from mesor show large negative deviations overnight and modest daytime elevations, but these hourly deviations have weak individual correlations with CES‑D in the study sample; the aggregate circadian indices (stability, autocorrelation, amplitude) provide the stronger signal for mood‑related risk here.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study mean:
Weighing the evidence, the preponderance of objective (wearable) and subjective indicators linked to depression — very short and highly irregular sleep, disturbed subjective sleep, low circadian stability and amplitude, elevated perceived stress, reduced reported happiness, and limited social/physical activity — suggests that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study sample mean CES‑D score (sample mean = 13.32). Protective factors (high self‑esteem, strong academic performance, minimal substance use, and near‑average health satisfaction) moderate the overall risk estimate but do not fully counterbalance the strong, multilevel signals from sleep and circadian dysregulation, which are among the more potent correlates of higher CES‑D scores in this dataset. Note that this conclusion is probabilistic and based on correlational associations and z‑score comparisons rather than a direct CES‑D score for the participant; interpretation should consider these limitations and the modest effect sizes on some measures."
79395,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of strong self-report indicators that align with higher depressive symptoms alongside wearable-derived behavioral and physiological features that are, in several respects, relatively resilient. Key self-report measures that typically track closely with CES-D scores (trait anxiety, self‑esteem, current happiness) are substantially atypical in directions associated with higher depressive symptom burden, whereas objective sleep quantity, circadian regularity and social/exercise activities appear more normative or protective. On balance, the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study population mean (population mean CES-D = 13.26), driven primarily by self-report risk markers.

Evidence consistent with higher depressive symptoms: Trait anxiety is high (STAI = 54; Z = +1.25) and that measure shows a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most potent signals here. Self‑esteem is notably low (RSES = 25; Z = −1.85) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.70), again indicating substantial risk. Self‑rated current happiness is low (Current = 2.0; Z = −1.61; r = −0.46), and interpersonal trust is reduced (Z = −1.10; r = −0.41); both of these are associated with higher depressive symptoms in the cohort. The PSQI score of 6 meets the conventional threshold for disturbed subjective sleep, and although its Z-score is modest (−0.33), the subjective sleep disturbance combined with elevated trait anxiety and low self‑esteem increases the likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. These self‑report indicators together form a coherent psychological profile that commonly co-occurs with CES‑D elevations.

Evidence consistent with lower depressive symptoms or resilience: Several objective behavioral and physiological metrics suggest stability and routine that are typically protective. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 15 min (Z = +0.09), and sleep duration variability is not elevated (SD = 88 min; Z = −0.29), indicating adequate and relatively consistent sleep quantity. Circadian stability metrics derived from heart rate are relatively strong (interdaily stability = 0.55; Z = +1.16; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = +1.15), and intradaily variability is lower than average (Z = −0.53), consistent with a regular daily structure. Resting heart rate is slightly below the sample mean (56.7 bpm; Z = −0.17), which often reflects good cardiovascular fitness or low baseline physiological arousal. Behavioral/lifestyle features that typically protect against depressive symptoms are present: the participant exercises with others frequently (frequency Z = +1.23), reports regular socializing (1–2 hours, near mean), has a healthy BMI (19.9), and academic performance is strong—these elements support resilience and lower CES‑D risk.

Features with mixed or intermediate implications: Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:21 AM) but relatively consistent (sleep start SD Z = −0.80). Late bedtime can be associated with mood risk in some contexts, but the preserved sleep duration and regularity mitigate that concern. Wearable-derived hourly heart rate shows expected nocturnal dips and daytime elevations; however, there are relatively higher than average heart rate deviations in the late evening (9–11 PM; Z ≈ +1.1–1.26) which could indicate evening physiological activation (e.g., arousal or rumination) that plausibly connects to anxiety and mood symptoms. Importantly, most wearable circadian and heart‑rate metrics have small correlations with CES‑D in this sample (near zero to small), so their contribution to inference about depression is limited compared with the strong self‑report signals.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean: Integrating all modalities, the strongest, most predictive signals (high trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, low current happiness, low interpersonal trust) point toward an elevated level of depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. This inference is tempered by objective indicators of routine, adequate sleep duration, social activity and physical fitness, which are protective and argue against severe functional disruption. Accordingly, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is best characterized as above the population mean CES‑D score (i.e., higher than average), with the elevation primarily driven by psychological self‑report measures rather than by clear objective circadian or sleep pathology. This is an inferential assessment for research purposes; it is not a clinical diagnosis and should be interpreted alongside direct CES‑D scores and clinical evaluation where appropriate."
59863,"Summary: The multimodal profile assembled from self-report surveys and wearable-derived physiology indicates a pattern characterized primarily by psychological and behavioral strengths alongside a modestly elevated baseline cardiovascular tone. On self-report measures the participant shows low trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71), high self-regard (Rosenberg self‑esteem Z = +1.66) and relatively high momentary happiness (Current happiness Z = +1.64). Perceived stress is below the study mean (PSS Z = -0.44) and subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Objective sleep metrics are also generally normative to slightly favorable (median sleep duration 7 h 24 m, Z = +0.27; low night-to-night variability, SD Z = -0.69). Behavioral habits consistent with lower depressive symptom burden include regular exercise (exercising alone three+ times weekly, Z ≈ +1.07), socializing, abstinence from recreational drug use, and generally high health satisfaction (Z = +1.3). Taken together, these features constitute multiple psychosocial and behavioral indicators associated with reduced depressive symptoms.

Evidence suggesting lower depressive symptom burden: Several strong protective signals converge. High self‑esteem and high current happiness—both of which correlate negatively with CES‑D in this sample—are among the most robust psychosocial indicators here (self‑esteem correlation with CES‑D = -0.71; happiness correlation = -0.46). Low trait anxiety (STAI Z = -1.71) and modest perceived stress further reduce the likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms. Sleep quantity and regularity are adequate to favorable (median duration ~7.4 hours, low sleep variability, no habitual naps), and the wearable non‑parametric circadian measures show a well‑structured rhythm (low intradaily variability, Z = -1.16; interdaily stability slightly above average, Z = +0.42), which in prior work is associated with lower mood disturbance. Frequent physical activity and moderate social engagement provide additional behavioral resilience.

Evidence suggesting factors associated with relatively higher depressive symptoms: Physiological signals provide the primary sources of concern. The participant’s heart‑rate mesor and resting heart rate are elevated relative to the study population (Mesor = 91.26, Z = +2.36; Resting HR ≈ 67.7 bpm, Z = +1.13), and both features have small positive correlations with CES‑D in this sample (mesor r ≈ +0.20; resting HR r ≈ +0.20). Elevated average cardiovascular tone can reflect chronic physiological arousal, poorer cardiovascular fitness, or autonomic imbalance and is associated with modestly higher depressive symptoms in this dataset. Some daytime heart‑rate deviations (mid‑afternoon acrophase ~4:23 PM, modest amplitude) and small positive correlations of early‑morning deviations with CES‑D are present, but these hourly deviations are not large and correlations are weak. A few lifestyle correlates (e.g., greater time listening to music or internet use) show small positive associations with CES‑D in the sample, but these effects are minor here.

Circadian and sleep interpretation: The circadian profile derived from heart rate indicates a coherent and stable daily structure (low intradaily fragmentation and positive interdaily stability), with a clear daytime rise and nighttime fall in heart rate. Objective sleep duration and timing fall within normative ranges for this sample and subjective sleep quality is acceptable. These circadian and sleep features are generally protective against depressive symptoms. The elevated mesor and resting HR coexist with otherwise regular rhythms, which suggests a consistent daily schedule but with higher baseline cardiovascular activation rather than disrupted timing.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of psychosocial, behavioral, and sleep indicators points toward a depressive symptom level below the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.33). Key protective markers—high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, high self‑reported happiness, regular exercise, good subjective and objective sleep, and low circadian fragmentation—carry substantial weight. The principal countervailing signal is an elevated average and resting heart rate (mesor Z = +2.36; resting HR Z = +1.13), which is associated with a modest increase in CES‑D in the sample and suggests monitoring of physiological arousal or cardiovascular health. Overall, the combined data most consistently indicate depressive symptomatology below the sample mean, but the elevated cardiovascular tone warrants cautious follow‑up because it represents a physiological correlate linked to higher depressive scores in this cohort.

Limitations: Inference is based on cross‑sectional and aggregated wearable measures and correlational sample statistics; associations do not establish causation. The hourly heart‑rate deviations are aggregated across days and cannot resolve within‑day or event‑linked dynamics. Small correlation magnitudes for many metrics mean individual-level prediction is imprecise. Continuous clinical assessment would be required to confirm symptom severity."
22913,"Summary of self-reported psychological and behavioral measures:
The participant’s trait and symptom reports largely align with a lower level of depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 34, Z = -0.72) is below the study mean and correlates strongly with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81); this lower anxiety proneness is therefore a robust indicator pointing away from elevated depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem is high (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03 relative to the sample range) and, given its strong negative correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = -0.71), also favors fewer depressive symptoms. Perceived stress (PSS = 20, Z = -0.44) and the PSQI sleep-quality score (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8; classified as “good sleep”) are both lower than average, which is consistent with lower CES-D scores in this cohort. In contrast, the participant reports somewhat lower current happiness (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53), which—with its modest negative correlation to CES-D (r = -0.46)—is a feature that could be associated with higher depressive symptoms relative to the participant’s otherwise protective profile.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular indicators:
Cardiovascular circadian metrics indicate a reasonably well-structured rhythm. Interdaily stability is near the cohort mean (0.41, Z = 0.0), intradaily variability is notably low (0.29, Z = -1.8), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly below the mean (0.29, Z = -0.28). The low intradaily variability suggests consolidated day–night structure with few rapid activity/physiological switches across the day — a pattern generally associated with lower depressive symptom burden rather than with fragmentation that often accompanies depression. Cosinor-derived MESOR is elevated (87.24, Z = 1.81) and resting heart rate is slightly above the sample mean (64.6 bpm, Z = 0.77); both MESOR and resting HR show small positive correlations with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.2), indicating that these cardiovascular elevations modestly favor higher depressive symptom scores, although the effect size here is small relative to other indicators.

Sleep behavior and timing:
Objective sleep duration is longer than the cohort average (median nightly sleep = 8 h 37 m, Z = 1.79) and subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5), with relatively stable sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 83 minutes, Z ≈ 0). These features—sustained, relatively long sleep and stable timing—tend to associate with lower CES-D in many samples and in this study show either negligible or small positive correlations with CES-D (sleep duration r ≈ 0.01; sleep variability r ≈ 0.2). The absence of frequent naps (mean daily naps = 0.12, Z = 0.61) also suggests a consolidated nocturnal sleep pattern rather than excessive daytime sleepiness or fragmentation.

Behavioral and social activity indicators:
The participant reports relatively low frequencies of exercise and organized sports (exercising alone/with others: 1–2 times/month; sports: not at all), and socializing time is below average (≈31 minutes/hour, Z = -0.62). Lower physical activity and reduced social time are behavioral features that, in this cohort, relate modestly to higher CES-D (exercise correlations r ≈ -0.09 to -0.23; socializing r ≈ -0.02). Alcohol use (beer/wine or liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0) is above the population mean in usage frequency but shows negligible correlation with CES-D here (r ≈ -0.05 to -0.02). Overall, reduced exercise and somewhat lower social engagement are the main behavioral signals that, if considered in isolation, would point toward somewhat higher depressive symptoms.

Factors pointing toward higher versus lower CES-D in this participant:
Evidence favoring a lower CES‑D relative to the study sample: low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, below-average perceived stress, objectively long and relatively regular sleep, and a very low intradaily variability (i.e., consolidated circadian pattern). Collectively these are strong and consistent indicators that align with a lower depressive symptom burden. Evidence suggesting higher CES‑D: slightly lower self-reported current happiness, low frequency of exercise and sports participation, reduced socializing, and modestly elevated MESOR/resting heart rate. The cardiovascular elevations and the behavioral shortfalls (exercise/socializing) are smaller effects in magnitude compared with the protective trait and sleep indicators; their correlations with CES‑D in this sample are modest.

Holistic inference relative to the study population:
Taking the full multimodal profile together, the balance of evidence points to this participant having a depressive symptom level at or below the study sample mean. The strongest predictors in this dataset (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) both indicate lower CES‑D, and objective sleep and circadian consolidation further support a lower symptom level. Some behavioral features (low exercise, less socializing) and slightly elevated resting cardiovascular tone are countervailing signals but are smaller in magnitude. Therefore, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is most consistent with being below the population mean CES‑D score of 13.34 rather than above it.

Notes on interpretation and limitations:
This inference integrates multiple modestly correlated indicators and does not substitute for a direct CES‑D score or a clinical evaluation. Several wearable-derived associations with CES‑D are small in this cohort, and behavioral self-reports (e.g., socializing, exercise, substance use) may reflect situational or semester-specific constraints. The strongest and most reliable signals in these data are trait anxiety and self‑esteem; conclusions weight these measures more heavily because of their larger sample-level correlations with CES‑D."
48969,"Risk indicators consistent with elevated depressive symptoms are prominent in this participant’s profile. Trait anxiety is markedly high (STAI = 59; Z = 1.75) and, within this dataset, shows a very strong positive correlation with CES‑D scores (r = 0.81), making it one of the most informative single predictors available here. Self‑esteem is substantially low (Rosenberg = 22; Z = −2.28), and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in this sample (r = −0.70), which reinforces the inference that low mood and negative self‑appraisal are salient. Subjective sleep disturbance is severe (PSQI = 13; Z = 2.9), and poor perceived sleep quality is commonly associated with higher depressive symptom burden. Behavioral markers that typically align with higher depression are also present: very low reported socializing (≈15 minutes per day; Z = −2.20), extensive solitary screen‑based sedentary activity (video games and TV both >4 hours/day, high positive Z‑scores), and low current self‑rated happiness (score = 2; Z = −1.61). Together these self‑report features form a coherent pattern (high anxiety, low self‑esteem, poor subjective sleep, social withdrawal, high sedentary leisure) that points toward CES‑D scores above the study population mean.

There are several features in the data that would tend to mitigate that inference or indicate lower risk relative to the study population. Objective sleep duration is within a broadly normative to slightly above‑average range (median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 51 min; Z = 0.84), and mean daily naps are effectively absent (Z = −0.86), which argues against gross hypersomnia or pervasive daytime sleepiness. The participant reports exercising alone three times per week or more (Z = 1.07), which is typically protective for mood. Substance use is minimal across categories (beer, wine/liquor, recreational and non‑prescribed drugs all very low or none), removing a common behavioral risk factor for depressive symptoms. Several wearable circadian regularity metrics (interdaily stability ≈ 0.4; Z ≈ −0.08 and autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 0.98) do not indicate extreme circadian fragmentation, and intradaily variability is not elevated (Z = −0.32). These objective activity and sleep measures temper the interpretation that the participant is severely impaired across all behavioral domains.

Physiological indicators from heart‑rate and circadian analyses provide a mixed but informative picture. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the study sample (RHR ≈ 68.6 bpm; Z = 1.24), and the MESOR is somewhat higher than average (MESOR Z = 0.79), suggesting a modestly elevated tonic cardiovascular arousal. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is slightly reduced (amplitude Z = −0.38), which, together with an evening acrophase (~5:06 PM), could reflect a somewhat blunted day–night physiological contrast. These features (higher tonic HR with lower amplitude) have small but positive correlations with CES‑D in this dataset and are consistent with physiological patterns sometimes seen in higher depressive symptomatology. At the same time, the hourly aggregated deviations show a clear nocturnal trough and daytime elevations consistent with preserved diurnal structure rather than gross dysregulation.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the evidence, the balance of strong, highly correlated psychological indicators (notably high trait anxiety and very low self‑esteem), severe subjective sleep disturbance, marked social withdrawal and low self‑reported happiness supports an inference that this participant’s depressive symptom level is above the study sample mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.23). Objective wearable data include some mitigating features (adequate median sleep duration, regularity of daily rhythm, regular solitary exercise, low substance use), but these do not fully offset the multiple, strongly predictive self‑report signals. This conclusion is probabilistic and correlational: the available measures point toward higher than average depressive symptomatology in this sample, but direct CES‑D score, clinical interview, or longitudinal follow‑up would be required for confirmation and to characterize severity or functional impact."
79731,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals, but several of the strongest and most reliably correlated indicators point toward elevated depressive symptomatology relative to the study sample. Notable markers include high trait anxiety (STAI = 60, Z = 1.85; STAI–CES-D correlation = 0.81), low global self-esteem (RSES = 29, Z = -1.29; correlation = -0.71), and poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98). Wearable data support circadian disruption (low amplitude, elevated intradaily variability, late and inconsistent sleep timing) and autonomic activation (elevated resting heart rate), which together align with patterns seen with higher CES-D scores.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES-D: The participant’s psychological self-reports include two of the study’s strongest correlates of depressive symptoms — very elevated trait anxiety and notably reduced self-esteem — both of which have large correlations with CES-D in this sample and strongly increase the likelihood of higher depressive symptom scores. Subjective sleep disturbance is pronounced (PSQI = 11), and objective sleep measurements add nuance: median nightly sleep is long (8 h 17 min; Z = 1.37) but highly variable across nights (sleep duration SD = 177 minutes; Z = 1.73), and typical sleep onset is very late (median start ≈ 02:58). Circadian measures from heart rate show a reduced amplitude (amplitude = 7.09, Z = -1.19), elevated intradaily variability (0.64, Z = 0.67), and reduced interdaily stability (0.34, Z = -0.57) — a pattern of flattened and less-regular rhythms that has been associated with greater depressive symptoms. Physiologically, resting heart rate is elevated (71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55) which, in this sample, modestly correlates with higher CES-D (r ≈ 0.19). Lifestyle markers that commonly co-occur with higher depressive symptoms are also present: minimal reported exercise and low health satisfaction (health satisfaction Z = -1.53).

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES-D: There are some countervailing signs. The participant rates current happiness above the sample mean (happiness = 4.0, Z = 0.55; happiness–CES-D correlation = -0.46), and reported social time is not absent (≈1–2 hours daily), which may buffer mood. Substance use is low or minimal, and recreational drug use is absent — behaviors that reduce some risk. Objectively, the heart rate data still show a diurnal pattern (an identifiable acrophase at ~6:27 PM and a positive mesor), indicating retained day–night structure rather than complete rhythm collapse; several hourly heart-rate deviations fall within typical ranges. Some daytime activity indicators (e.g., moderate Internet and media use, frequent listening to music) could reflect active coping or engagement rather than severe withdrawal, though their interpretation is mixed.

Holistic comparison to the study sample: Weighing the evidence, the balance of strong correlates (particularly very high trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and disturbed subjective sleep) and objective markers of circadian irregularity and elevated resting heart rate leads to the inference that the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.27). Several indicators point relatively strongly in that direction, so the most supported categorical comparison is “above the population mean,” although the precise CES-D score cannot be determined from these data alone.

Limitations and caveats: This synthesis integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable features and uses observed sample correlations to aid interpretation; it is not a diagnostic assessment. Correlations reported here are associations from the study sample and do not prove causation. Wearable heart-rate metrics are aggregated by hour across days (so they do not reflect day-to-day trends), and some signals (e.g., long median sleep) can be ambiguous (long sleep may reflect recovery or hypersomnia associated with depression). Clinical interpretation should incorporate a direct CES-D score and, if possible, a structured clinical interview or follow-up symptom inventories for confirmation."
64296,"Protective features and evidence pointing toward lower depressive symptom burden:
The participant presents several converging indicators that, in this sample, are associated with lower CES‑D scores. On self-report, trait measures show relatively favorable emotional functioning: trait anxiety (STAI = 35) is in the non‑anxious range (Z = -0.62), self‑esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 0.96) and current self‑reported happiness is high (Z = 1.64). Perceived stress is low relative to the cohort (PSS Z = -0.98) and subjective sleep quality is judged good (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a strongly rhythmic cardiovascular pattern — high amplitude (Z = 2.7), above‑average interdaily stability (Z = 1.41) and a relatively high 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.32) — all of which reflect a consistent, well‑entrained daily structure that is generally linked to better mood outcomes. The participant’s resting heart rate is low (49.8 bpm, Z = -0.99), which in this sample is not associated with higher CES‑D and may reflect good cardiovascular fitness or low physiological arousal. Nighttime heart‑rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal decline relative to the mesor, consistent with clear sleep‑period physiology. Sleep timing and variability are consistent (median start ~01:07, sleep start SD ~50 minutes, sleep SD 42 minutes, both below cohort means), and mean nightly sleep approaches seven hours (6 h 52 m, modestly below average), together suggesting relatively stable sleep behavior. Low substance use and low reported daily stressors, together with minimal napping, further support a behavioral profile that tends to align with lower depressive symptomatology.

Features that suggest elevated risk or could increase depressive symptoms:
There are some behavioral and temporal features that modestly lean toward increased depressive risk. The median sleep start time is late (around 1:07 AM); delayed sleep timing has been associated in prior work with worse mood for some individuals. Median sleep duration is slightly shorter than the sample mean (Z = -0.4), which could be a minor risk factor if sustained. Social behavior indicators show limited in‑person socializing (reported 16–30 minutes per day, Z = -1.41) and relatively low frequency of exercise performed alone (reported “not at all”, Z = -1.93), which may reflect reduced engagement in solitary or routine physical activity and lower social contact — both factors that can relate to higher depressive symptoms. Some leisure patterns (a modest elevation in sedentary hobby time, Z = 0.82) are present. Correlations in the dataset show small positive associations between several nocturnal heart‑rate deviations and CES‑D (e.g., deeper overnight dips have small positive correlations), but these correlations are weak and should be interpreted cautiously.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
Weighing all multimodal evidence, the balance of indicators favors a lower level of depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. Strong protective signals — elevated self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, high current happiness, low perceived stress, robust and regular circadian cardiac rhythms (high amplitude and interdaily stability), low resting heart rate, good subjective sleep quality, and low substance use — outweigh the comparatively modest risk signals (late sleep timing, slightly short sleep duration, limited socializing, and low solitary exercise). In relation to the cohort mean CES‑D of 13.34 (SD = 9.61), the pattern of measures is most consistent with a CES‑D score below the population mean. This inference rests particularly on the very high predictive weight of self‑esteem and trait anxiety in the sample correlations (self‑esteem strongly inversely correlated with CES‑D; STAI strongly positively correlated), combined with the physiological markers of regular, high‑amplitude circadian organization.

Caveats:
These conclusions are probabilistic and based on associations in the provided sample rather than a direct CES‑D score for the participant. Some behavioral indicators (late sleep timing, limited in‑person social time, low exercise frequency) could become more influential over longer observation windows or in response to stressors. Aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations and cosinor metrics describe typical daily structure but do not capture acute day‑to‑day variability or context."
17569,"Indicators that align with relatively higher depressive symptoms in this participant center on sleep disturbance and perceived stress. The participant reports clinically disturbed sleep (PSQI = 8; Z = 0.59) and the wearable record shows short median nightly sleep (5 h 44 min; Z = -1.81), a late median sleep onset (01:11:30) and modest night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ~32 minutes). Several wearable-derived variability measures (e.g., sleep duration SD and sleep-start SD) show small positive correlations with CES-D in the study (r ≈ 0.20–0.22), and specific nocturnal heart-rate deviations (e.g., early-morning hours) have small positive correlations with CES-D (r up to ≈0.16), suggesting sleep-related physiology and timing may be associated with higher symptom levels. The participant’s perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 24; Z = 0.65), and current self-rated happiness is lower than average (happiness = 3.0; Z = -0.53), both of which are modestly associated with higher CES-D in the sample. Taken together, poor subjective sleep quality, objectively short sleep duration and higher perceived stress form the most salient risk-related cluster in the data.

Conversely, several robust indicators point toward relatively lower depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety was not elevated (STAI = 38; Z = -0.33), and trait anxiety in this sample correlates strongly with CES-D (r ≈ 0.81), so a lower anxiety score is a substantive protective factor. Self-esteem is high relative to the sample (RSES Z ≈ 0.68) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), indicating one of the strongest protective signals in the data. The participant also reports relatively high interpersonal trust and high health satisfaction (trust Z ≈ 1.15; health satisfaction Z ≈ 1.13), both negatively correlated with CES-D in the sample, which would be expected to buffer depressive symptoms. Wearable circadian metrics show reasonably strong regularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ 1.16 and amplitude Z ≈ 0.91) and a distinct diurnal heart-rate pattern (clear daytime peaks and lower nocturnal rates, resting HR = 47 bpm, Z ≈ -1.33), features that are generally consistent with structured daily rhythms and behavioral activation that tend to accompany lower depressive symptom levels.

Integrative appraisal and comparison to the study sample mean: weighing the evidence, the profile presents a mix of substantial protective traits (particularly high self-esteem, low trait anxiety, high trust and health satisfaction) and notable risk factors centered on sleep disruption and elevated stress. On balance this pattern is most consistent with an overall depressive symptom level near the study sample mean CES-D (population mean = 13.31). Given the strong negative predictors (especially self-esteem and low trait anxiety) versus the moderate-to-strong sleep and stress signals, my best estimate is that the participant’s CES-D is likely close to the mean and may be somewhat below the sample mean rather than markedly above it; however, the presence of objective short sleep and elevated perceived stress suggests a nontrivial risk for heightened symptoms and warrants attention in any follow-up assessment."
77036,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of risk and protective features for depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43) and elevated perceived stress coexist with high self‑esteem (RSES = 38) and above‑average self‑reported happiness. Wearable-derived circadian measures show a well‑structured 24‑hour cardiac rhythm (high interdaily stability and very high 24‑hour autocorrelation, low intradaily variability), relatively regular sleep timing, and modest nightly sleep duration slightly below the cohort mean. Taken together, the convergence of psychological, behavioral and physiological signals suggests neither a uniformly high nor uniformly low depressive symptom burden; overall, the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels near (and plausibly slightly below) the study population mean CES‑D score.

Features that point toward relatively higher depressive symptoms: The participant reports moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; Z ≈ 0.17) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 23; Z ≈ 0.38). In this dataset STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81), meaning anxiety proneness is an important risk marker. Subjective sleep quality is classified as “disturbed” on the PSQI (score = 6), which is associated with greater depressive symptoms in the literature and with modest positive correlations here. Behavioral indices that can be linked to higher symptom levels include limited social time (socializing 16–30 minutes daily, Z ≈ −1.41), low interpersonal trust (Z ≈ −0.46) and infrequent exercise alone or with others (Zs ≈ −1.18 and −0.88). Variability metrics show that greater night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing and duration has small positive correlations with CES‑D in this sample (sleep start SD Z ≈ −0.55 but corr ≈ 0.22; sleep duration SD corr ≈ 0.20), suggesting that any remaining irregularity may modestly contribute to symptom risk.

Features that point toward relatively lower depressive symptoms: Several strong protective signals are present. Self‑esteem is high (RSES = 38; Z ≈ −0.03) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ −0.71), indicating a substantial buffer against depressive symptoms. Current self‑reported happiness is above the cohort mean (Z ≈ 0.55) and negatively correlated with CES‑D. The participant shows low substance use and limited recreational inactivity (e.g., minimal alcohol, no recreational drug use), which reduces exposure to substance‑related risk. Critically, wearable circadian measures indicate a highly regular cardiac rhythm: interdaily stability is elevated (value 0.53, Z ≈ 1.0), intradaily variability is low (value 0.36, Z ≈ −1.31), and autocorrelation at 24 h is very high (value 0.62, Z ≈ 2.49). These objective markers of strong daily rhythmicity are generally associated with lower depressive symptoms and better mood regulation. Nightly sleep duration is slightly below the cohort mean (median 6 h 51 min, Z ≈ −0.41) but relatively consistent (sleep SD 67 min, Z ≈ −0.77), and sleep start timing is fairly regular (median start ~00:47, SD ~58 min, Z ≈ −0.55), both of which support stable circadian entrainment.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean CES‑D: Balancing the evidence, the strongest single risk correlate in the dataset is trait anxiety (high correlation with CES‑D), but its absolute elevation here is modest (STAI Z ≈ 0.17). The participant’s high self‑esteem and above‑average happiness are strong protective factors with large inverse correlations to CES‑D, and objective physiological data (notably the pronounced interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation) provide additional protective evidence. Behavioral risks (limited socializing, infrequent exercise, disturbed subjective sleep) are present but of smaller magnitude relative to the protective signals. Considering the relative magnitudes and the correlation structure in this sample, the most defensible summary is that the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is near the population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.32); the balance of indicators suggests they are plausibly slightly below the population mean rather than substantially above it. This conclusion should be regarded as probabilistic and contingent on the proxy measures available here (no direct CES‑D score provided for the participant)."
82986,"Summary of protective indicators (features associated with lower CES‑D scores):
The participant reports several robust self‑reported protective characteristics. Rosenberg self‑esteem is substantially above the study mean (Z = +1.66) and the self‑esteem measure has a strong inverse correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ −0.71), which provides a comparatively strong signal consistent with fewer depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) is low (score = 25, Z = −1.61) and this measure is highly positively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ +0.81), so the low anxiety score is another strong indicator of lower depressive symptomatology. Current self‑reported happiness is also high (Z = +1.64, r with CES‑D ≈ −0.46), and interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are above average (Trust Z ≈ +1.79; Health satisfaction Z ≈ +0.80), both of which align with lower CES‑D scores. Behavioral data show minimal substance use and at least some exercise (exercising alone 1–2×/week, modestly above sample mean), and routine socializing near the sample average — all of which are neutral-to-protective with respect to depressive symptoms.

Summary of risk indicators (features associated with higher CES‑D scores):
Several objective sleep and circadian/physiological features suggest vulnerability factors that, in this dataset, are associated with higher depressive symptoms. Nighttime sleep appears substantially restricted: median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 6 minutes (Z ≈ −2.60), and subjective sleep quality is in the disturbed range on the PSQI (score = 6). Short sleep duration and disturbed sleep are well‑recognized risk factors for elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈02:24), which—together with short total sleep—indicates a pattern of delayed and truncated nocturnal sleep. Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show a relatively low amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ −1.04) and reduced regularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ −0.66), patterns that are commonly linked to higher depressive symptom burden; amplitude here is inversely related to CES‑D in the sample (small-to-moderate r in the reported data), so the depressed amplitude is a plausible physiological marker of increased risk. Resting heart rate and MESOR are higher than average (RHR Z ≈ +1.03; MESOR Z ≈ +0.79) and these metrics show small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (RHR r ≈ +0.20, MESOR r ≈ +0.19), consistent with modestly elevated physiological arousal associated with more depressive symptoms. Finally, relative inactivity in certain recreational activities and very low frequency of exercising with others may reflect lower behavioral activation or fewer structured social activities, which can contribute to mood risk in some individuals.

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement relative to the study population mean:
Weighing the evidence, the data present a mixed but interpretable profile. The strongest individual protective signals are high self‑esteem and low trait anxiety (both with large standardized deviations and strong correlations with CES‑D in the sample), and current self‑reported happiness is also well above average. These self‑report indicators, given their relatively large effect sizes in the provided correlations, argue for a lower level of depressive symptoms. Conversely, the largest objective risk signal is the very short and late sleep pattern (sleep duration Z ≈ −2.60 and PSQI indicating disturbed sleep), together with lowered circadian amplitude and slightly elevated resting heart rate—physiological features that tend to map onto greater depressive symptom burden. Considering the magnitude and predictive weight of these features, the overall balance of evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely around the study sample mean, with some offsets in both directions: strong psychological/self‑report protections push toward lower-than‑average symptoms, while pronounced sleep and circadian irregularities push toward higher-than‑average symptoms. Therefore, the most defensible summary is that inferred depressive symptom level is near the population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.33), acknowledging that substantial opposing signals (strong self‑esteem/happiness versus very short/disturbed sleep and damped circadian amplitude) create uncertainty about a precise placement above or below that mean.

Caveats and uncertainty:
This interpretation is probabilistic and relies on cross‑sectional associations and aggregated wearable summaries rather than a direct CES‑D score for the individual. Correlations reported in the dataset vary in magnitude (some are strong, some small) and do not establish causality. Short sleep and circadian dampening are salient objective risk markers here and may warrant targeted follow‑up (sleep assessment/intervention), even if global self‑report measures suggest resilience."
11402,"Summary of multimodal profile
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant presents a mixed profile of risk and protective features for depressive symptoms. Prominent findings include elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 54; z = +1.25), a relatively late and variable sleep schedule (median sleep start ≈ 03:17, sleep-start SD ≈ 135 min; z = +1.14), shorter-than-average nightly sleep (median 6 h 19 min; z = −1.07), and heart-rate indices indicating a higher overall cardiac set point (MESOR = 83.5 bpm; z = +1.30) with an evening acrophase (≈ 6:58 PM). Circadian regularity metrics show modestly reduced interdaily stability (0.37; z ≈ −0.33) and low 24-hour autocorrelation (0.20; z ≈ −1.03), while intradaily variability is low (0.34; z ≈ −1.45). Self-report protective signals include relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 40; z = +0.26), a PSQI at the threshold for “good sleep” (score = 5; z ≈ −0.8), low recreational drug use, and moderate social engagement.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
Several high-salience indicators in this dataset point toward elevation of depressive symptom risk relative to the study sample. Most notably, trait anxiety is elevated (STAI 54; z = +1.25) and the STAI shows a very strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), making this one of the strongest single predictors available here. Objective sleep timing is markedly delayed and variable (median sleep onset ≈ 03:17; high SD of sleep start times; naps elevated, z ≈ +1.21), and total nightly sleep is shorter than the sample mean (median 6 h 19 min; z ≈ −1.07). Both late/irregular sleep timing and reduced sleep duration are commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms and are modestly correlated with CES-D in this dataset (sleep-timing variability and sleep-duration correlations trend positive). Heart-rate–based circadian disruption is also present: MESOR is elevated (z ≈ +1.30), 24-hour autocorrelation and interdaily stability are lower than typical (z ≈ −1.03 and −0.33 respectively), indicating weaker day-to-day regularity of cardiovascular rhythm — a pattern that has been linked to mood disturbance. Behavioral patterns that may contribute to risk include relatively low organized sport participation, limited exercise frequency (exercising alone/with others about 1–2× per week), high time spent on video games (z ≈ +2.47), and elevated BMI (30.1), which can be associated with worse mood or health-related distress. Together, these features (especially the elevated, highly CES-D–correlated trait anxiety and circadian/sleep irregularity) weigh toward a higher CES-D score.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
Balancing the above, the participant has several characteristics associated with lower depressive symptoms or resilience. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 40; top of scale), and in this sample self-esteem correlates substantially and negatively with CES-D (r ≈ −0.71), making it a strong protective factor. The participant’s PSQI score (5) classifies their subjective sleep quality at the borderline of “good,” and their self-reported current happiness is moderate (score = 3.0; z ≈ −0.53) rather than very low. Interdaily intraday variability is low (intradaily variability z ≈ −1.45), which can indicate fewer abrupt transitions and less fragmentation in activity/rest patterns — a potentially stabilizing physiological feature. The participant reports low recreational drug use and limited non-prescribed substance use, has moderate socializing time, and reports relatively high interpersonal trust — all factors that typically relate to lower CES-D or buffer stress-related symptomatology. Some wearable metrics (moderate amplitude, evening acrophase) indicate preserved circadian amplitude rather than a flattened rhythm, which can be protective relative to severely blunted rhythms.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
When these data are integrated, the most compelling contributors to elevated depressive symptoms are the markedly elevated trait anxiety (a strong, highly correlated predictor in this sample), objective markers of circadian and sleep disruption (late, variable sleep timing; shortened median sleep; reduced day-to-day circadian stability), and an elevated cardiac MESOR. Protective factors that reduce the likelihood of high CES-D in this profile include high self-esteem, borderline-good subjective sleep quality, limited substance use, and some social engagement. Given the relative weight of predictors (notably the strong STAI–CES-D relationship and the measurable sleep/circadian dysregulation), the overall pattern is more consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study sample mean (population CES-D mean = 13.3). In other words, it is more likely than not that this participant’s CES-D would fall above the sample mean rather than near or below it, though the presence of substantial protective factors makes a very high CES-D less certain.

Uncertainty and practical implications
This inference is probabilistic and constrained by available measures: correlations in the dataset guide interpretation but do not deterministically specify an individual’s CES-D score. Key sources of uncertainty include reliance on cross-sectional/aggregated wearable summaries (which do not capture within-person trends across the semester) and potential reporting biases in self-report instruments. Clinically relevant next steps, if appropriate for the research aims, would be targeted assessment of current depressive symptoms (direct CES-D or clinical interview), monitoring of sleep timing and its relation to daytime function, and consideration of interventions that address anxiety and circadian regularity (e.g., consistent sleep–wake schedule, behavioral activation, anxiety-targeted strategies)."
38610,"Summary of indicators linked to higher depressive symptom levels
- Sleep and circadian dysregulation: Wearable-recorded sleep is short (median sleep duration 5 h 46 min; Z = -1.76) with a very late typical sleep onset (median start ≈ 02:39). The PSQI score (7.0) is in the “disturbed sleep” range. Short sleep and late, irregular sleep timing are both well-established behavioral correlates of elevated depressive symptoms, and here the participant’s circadian amplitude is reduced (amplitude = 7.23, Z = -1.15) and interdaily stability is modestly low (0.37, Z = -0.33), consistent with a blunted and less regular cardiac circadian rhythm—another pattern that has been associated with greater depressive symptomatology.  
- Physiological arousal: Resting heart rate and MESOR are above the study mean (resting HR = 67.7 bpm, MESOR = 82.33; both Z ≈ +1.14) and these metrics show small positive correlations with CES-D in the study sample (r ≈ 0.20). Elevated tonic cardiovascular activity can index increased physiological stress and is therefore a potential risk-related signal.  
- Subjective stress: Perceived stress (PSS = 23; Z = +0.38) is modestly elevated and, in the sample, correlates positively with CES-D (r ≈ 0.28). Taken together, these sleep/circadian, autonomic, and stress indicators point toward measurable risk factors that tend to co-occur with higher depressive symptom scores.

Summary of indicators linked to lower depressive symptom levels
- Trait and affective measures: Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 28; Z = -1.31) is low relative to the sample and the STAI–Trait scale is strongly positively correlated with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81); thus a low trait-anxiety score is a substantial protective signal. Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = +1.66; note strong negative correlation with CES-D, r ≈ -0.71), and current self-reported happiness is elevated (Happy current = 5.0; Z = +1.64). Both large-magnitude signals (high self-esteem and reported happiness) are robustly associated with lower depressive symptoms in this dataset.  
- Social, behavioral, and functional indicators: The participant reports frequent exercise with others (Z = +1.23) and low substance use; health satisfaction is above average (Z ≈ +1.13). Academic functioning (GPA) is strong. These behavioral and functional markers are consistent with better mood and psychosocial functioning and are associated with lower CES-D scores in the study sample.

Balanced interpretation and synthesis
- The dataset contains a mixture of moderately strong protective psychosocial signals (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, relatively high current happiness, above-average health satisfaction, active social exercise behavior) and some physiological/behavioral risk signals (short sleep duration, late sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude, and elevated resting heart rate). In terms of effect magnitude, the psychosocial/trait measures are among the strongest deviations from the sample distribution (STAI and self-esteem Z-scores ~ ±1.3 to 1.7), whereas several of the physiologic and circadian signals are more modest (Z-scores around ±1.1 to 1.8 for sleep duration and amplitude). Correlations in the study indicate that the trait/affect measures (especially STAI and self-esteem) are strongly related to CES-D scores, whereas many wearable-derived circadian/HR features show smaller correlations with CES-D in this sample.
- Because the most predictive self-report indicators in this dataset (low trait anxiety and high self-esteem/happiness) point strongly toward lower depressive symptoms, and because objective risk signals (sleep and circadian markers) are moderate but not extreme, the overall multimodal pattern is more consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean than above it. The study population mean CES-D is 13.34 (SD = 9.61); based on the balance of psychosocial and behavioral/physiological indicators here, the participant’s profile is most consistent with CES-D scores below the sample mean or near the lower half of the sample distribution rather than with markedly elevated scores.
- Uncertainty and caveats: This inference rests on cross-sectional, aggregate associations and on metrics with differing predictive strength in the sample (e.g., very strong sample correlations for STAI and self-esteem vs. smaller correlations for many wearable features). The objective sleep and circadian signals are notable and could reflect a vulnerability that is not fully captured by current self-report mood measures; they warrant monitoring because chronic short sleep and circadian disruption can increase risk over time. Finally, these data are not diagnostic; they indicate relative position versus the study mean and identify converging protective and risk factors that should be considered together in longitudinal or clinical assessment.

Concise conclusion
- Relative to the study sample mean CES-D (13.34), the multimodal profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below or near the population mean, driven primarily by low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, and elevated current happiness; however, objectively measured short sleep, late sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude, and slightly elevated resting HR represent meaningful risk signals that merit attention and monitoring."
96610,"Summary: The multi-modal profile presents a pattern in which several strong self-report indicators that are empirically and strongly associated with lower depressive symptoms coexist with a small number of behavioral and sleep-related indicators that are more commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (notably very low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, high momentary happiness and high health satisfaction) points toward depressive symptom levels that are below the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.34). Below I summarize evidence that argues for lower versus higher CES‑D scores, interpret the wearable-derived physiology and sleep data in context, and conclude with an overall comparative statement.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Trait anxiety (STAI) is very low (score = 25, z = -1.61) and this measure correlates strongly and positively with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.81). Low chronic anxiety is one of the strongest individual predictors here for a lower CES‑D.  
- Self‑esteem is elevated (Rosenberg score reported high, z = 1.66) and has a large negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = -0.71). High self‑esteem is therefore a robust protective correlate.  
- Current self‑reported happiness and health satisfaction are high (happiness z = 1.64; health satisfaction z = 2.05) and both correlate negatively with CES‑D in the sample (happiness r ≈ -0.46; health satisfaction r ≈ -0.39). These subjective well‑being indices further point away from elevated depressive symptoms.  
- Behavioral and substance‑use indicators are generally protective: absence of alcohol and recreational/non‑prescribed drug use, minimal napping (mean daily naps 0.11, z = 0.44 but low absolute value), and no heavy sedentary media use. These lifestyle features tend, in this dataset, to be associated with lower CES‑D or are at least not typical markers of elevated depressive symptoms.  
- Wearable circadian markers indicate a relatively robust, regular rhythm: amplitude is above the sample mean (amplitude z = 1.03) and interdaily stability is relatively high (z = 0.83). Strong amplitude and regular day-to-day structure in heart‑rate rhythms are small-to-moderate protective correlates of lower CES‑D in this cohort (amplitude r ≈ -0.10; interdaily stability ~0.0). Low intradaily variability (z = -0.25) also suggests limited fragmentation of daily physiological state, which is generally consistent with better mood regulation.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Subjective sleep quality is disturbed: PSQI = 8 (z = 0.59), which exceeds the common clinical cutoff (>5) and indicates notable sleep complaints over the past month. Poor subjective sleep quality is commonly associated with higher CES‑D scores.  
- Objective sleep timing is late: median sleep start is about 01:21 AM. Late bedtimes—especially if misaligned with social or circadian demands—can contribute to mood vulnerability in some individuals. Although sleep duration is only mildly below the sample mean (median 6 h 53 min, z = -0.37), the subjective report of disturbed sleep suggests the participant experiences sleep-related difficulties beyond total duration.  
- Small physiological cues that weakly favor higher CES‑D: mesor (overall heart‑rate level) is above the sample mean (mesor z = 0.92) and resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the sample (60.8 bpm, z = 0.32); both show small positive correlations with CES‑D in this dataset (mesor r ≈ 0.20; RHR r ≈ 0.19). These effects are modest and should be interpreted cautiously.  
- Some behavioral indices—sporadic socializing (socializing z = -0.62) and relatively infrequent solitary exercise—could be consistent with reduced social engagement and activity, factors that sometimes accompany higher depressive symptoms. Their sample correlations to CES‑D are small, however, and other activity indicators (sports 1–2×/week) mitigate concern.

Wearable hourly and circadian physiology interpretation
- The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline (large negative deviations between ~1–7 AM) and a clear daytime peak in the mid‑afternoon (acrophase ~4:20 PM; amplitude elevated). This pattern indicates a strong day–night separation in cardiovascular arousal and a preserved afternoon peak in physiological activation. In this cohort, stronger amplitude and a clear acrophase are modestly associated with lower CES‑D, suggesting physiologic rhythm integrity in this participant.  
- Interdaily stability (z = 0.83) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (z = 0.73) indicate consistent day‑to‑day timing of these rhythms across the recording period; such regularity generally corresponds to lower mood symptom burden or resilience in population studies, although correlations here are small. Because the hourly data are temporally aggregated, these inferences refer to typical timing and amplitude rather than changes over the semester.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the sample mean
- Balancing strong self‑report protective signals (very low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, elevated happiness and health satisfaction), disciplined and regular physiological rhythms (high amplitude and interdaily stability), and largely minimal substance use or excessive sedentary behavior, the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptomatology that is below the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.34).  
- Countervailing signs (disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, and modestly elevated mesor/resting HR) indicate some sleep‑related distress and small physiological elevations that could contribute to transient or subthreshold mood symptoms for this participant. These factors warrant attention but do not outweigh the stronger protective indicators in the available data.

Limitations and caveats
- Correlational strengths vary widely across features: the strongest predictive relations in this dataset are with trait anxiety and self‑esteem; many wearable‑derived correlations with CES‑D are small in magnitude and should be interpreted as supportive contextual information rather than determinative.  
- The hourly heart‑rate deviations are aggregated across days, so they do not permit examination of temporal changes (e.g., symptom escalation over the semester) or day‑specific events. Self‑report and wearable measures occasionally diverge (subjective poor sleep vs. near‑normal median sleep duration), reflecting the known dissociation between sleep experience and objective sleep quantity.

In sum: given the pattern of strong protective self‑report indicators and robust circadian rhythm characteristics alongside limited sleep complaints and late timing, the best-supported inference is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the population mean CES‑D score of 13.34, though there are specific sleep‑related concerns that could merit further assessment or monitoring."
77711,"Clinical-relevant indicators converging toward higher depressive symptomatology include the participant’s elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52; Z = +1.06) and relatively low self‑esteem (RSES = 28; Z = −1.43). These two self-report traits have the largest reported correlations with CES‑D in the dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.82; Self‑Esteem r ≈ −0.71), and therefore carry substantial weight in inferring depressive symptom risk. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) is an additional signal that commonly co-occurs with higher depressive symptoms. Wearable-derived circadian features provide supporting evidence: interdaily stability is somewhat low (0.34; Z = −0.57), indicating less regular day-to-day structure in heart‑rate rhythms, and sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 01:02 AM) — both patterns that have been associated with worse mood in population studies. Behavioral indicators such as elevated daily listening-to-music time (Z = +1.60) and above-average passive media use (watching TV/videos Z = +1.28) also correlate modestly with CES‑D in the sample and may reflect passive coping or reduced engagement in active reward-seeking behaviors.

Countervailing evidence consistent with lower depressive symptom severity is also present. The participant reports relatively low perceived stress (PSS = 17; Z = −1.26) and a current self-rated happiness that is above average (happy = 4.0; Z = +0.55), both of which point away from high depressive symptom burden. High academic functioning (multiple GPAs near 4.0) and a normal BMI (22.24) indicate preserved occupational/academic performance and physical health, which typically correlate with lower functional impairment from mood symptoms. Objective physiology also offers potentially protective signs: a relatively low resting heart rate (52.4 bpm; Z = −0.68) and a preserved afternoon acrophase and daytime heart‑rate elevation pattern (large positive deviations around early afternoon, e.g., 1–2 pm Z ≈ +1.65) are consistent with an intact daytime activity/arousal profile rather than global psychomotor slowing. The participant reports minimal substance and recreational drug use and no habitual napping, which reduces some behavioral risk factors for mood disturbance.

Integration of wearable-derived circadian metrics yields a nuanced picture. The mesor and overall amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm are somewhat lower than the sample mean (Mesor = 68.8 bpm, Z = −0.70; Amplitude Z = −0.08), suggesting modestly reduced average cardiac activation but not a pronounced blunting. Intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (0.51; Z = −0.25), implying fewer abrupt within-day transitions in activity/heart rate; together with reduced interdaily stability, these values suggest a pattern of consistent but slightly damped circadian structure with some day-to-day irregularity. Sleep quantity as measured by the wearable is only marginally below average in this sample (median sleep ≈ 6 h 55 min; Z = −0.33) and night-to-night variability is not elevated (SD ≈ 70 min; Z = −0.70), so objective sleep does not show the extreme fragmentation that often accompanies high depressive symptom severity. Correlations between most wearable features and CES‑D in the study are small or negligible, so these physiological signals should be treated as moderate rather than definitive evidence.

Weighing the evidence: trait measures that strongly predict CES‑D (notably high trait anxiety and low self‑esteem) and subjective sleep disturbance lean toward elevated depressive symptoms, while preserved daytime physiologic activation, strong academic performance, low perceived stress, low substance use, and some positive affect argue against severe dysfunction. On balance, the preponderance of high‑weight psychological indicators (STAI and Self‑Esteem) suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely modestly elevated relative to the study sample mean. Therefore, the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is best characterized as above the population mean CES‑D (population mean CES‑D = 13.31), although not necessarily indicative of severe or incapacitating symptoms given the presence of several protective signs described above.

Limitations and clinical caution: this synthesis integrates correlated self-report and wearable markers but does not replace a direct CES‑D score or clinical assessment. The strongest inferential weight comes from measures with high correlations to CES‑D in the sample (notably STAI and Self‑Esteem); wearable correlations were generally small, so physiological features should be treated as contextual rather than determinative."
17020,"Summary statement
Based on the combined self-report and wearable-derived data, the participant’s pattern of risk and protective indicators is mixed. Several subjective measures (elevated perceived stress, disturbed sleep quality, lower momentary happiness, low social engagement, late sleep timing) point toward greater depressive symptom burden, while several physiological and trait measures (high self‑esteem, low resting heart rate, near‑normal total sleep duration, modestly regular circadian structure) point toward lower symptom burden. Taking the totality of evidence together, the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is best characterized as near the study population mean CES‑D score (13.32) rather than clearly above or below it.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher depressive symptoms (factors favoring an above‑mean CES‑D)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The participant’s PSQI of 7 (above common clinical cutoffs) indicates clinically meaningful sleep difficulties, and higher PSQI is positively correlated with CES‑D in the sample. Subjective sleep problems are a well‑established correlate of elevated depressive symptoms.
- Elevated perceived stress and lower momentary positive affect: A PSS score of 24 (Z ≈ 0.65) indicates greater perceived stress; the PSS has a positive correlation with CES‑D in this dataset. Current self‑rated happiness is relatively low (score 3.0, Z ≈ −0.53) and is negatively correlated with CES‑D, so lower happiness aligns with greater depressive symptoms.
- Low social and physical activity engagement: The participant reports very limited socializing and minimal exercise (socializing Z ≈ −1.41; exercise frequencies low). Reduced social interaction and physical activity are behavioral markers frequently associated with higher depressive symptoms.
- Circadian fragmentation and late sleep timing: Intradaily variability is elevated (value 0.64, Z ≈ 0.67), indicating more fragmented within‑day rhythms, and the participant’s median sleep start time is late (~2:12 AM). Greater rhythm fragmentation and later sleep timing have been associated with higher depressive symptom levels in many studies.
- Subjective indicators of lower health satisfaction and limited recreational engagement (health satisfaction Z ≈ −0.78; low reported recreational activities) further align with risk for higher symptom burden.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower depressive symptoms (factors favoring a below‑mean CES‑D)
- High self‑esteem: The Rosenberg Self‑Esteem score is at the higher end (score 40, Z ≈ 0.26). In these data self‑esteem shows a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71), making this one of the strongest protective indicators in the profile.
- Objective cardiovascular indicators consistent with lower basal arousal/greater fitness: Resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm, Z ≈ −1.18) and the MESOR (mean HR) is low (59.63, Z ≈ −1.95). In this sample, MESOR and resting HR correlate positively (albeit modestly) with CES‑D; the participant’s low values therefore point away from elevated depressive symptoms.
- Adequate total sleep duration and low napping: Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 7 m (Z ≈ −0.08), close to normative values rather than markedly short or long sleep associated with depression. Mean daily naps are minimal. Objective total sleep within a typical range is a protective behavioral feature.
- Low substance use: The participant reports minimal alcohol and no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use, reducing risk associated with substance‑related worsening of mood.
- Relatively preserved interdaily stability and autocorrelation: Interdaily stability (0.43, Z ≈ 0.17) and 24‑h autocorrelation are near the sample mean, indicating some day‑to‑day regularity in rhythms which is generally protective relative to highly irregular patterns.

Interpretation of wearable circadian and hourly heart‑rate features
The heart‑rate cosinor parameters indicate a relatively low MESOR and reduced amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ −1.21), which together suggest lower average daytime cardiac activity and a blunted circadian amplitude. Lower amplitude and rhythm blunting are sometimes observed with depressive states, but in this individual the low MESOR and low resting HR are more consistent with lower basal cardiovascular activation (or higher cardiovascular fitness) and, in this dataset, are modestly associated with lower CES‑D. Intradaily variability is elevated, signaling within‑day fragmentation of activity/physiology; this specific feature is a small but consistent correlate of higher CES‑D in the sample and therefore pulls the inference modestly in the direction of elevated symptoms. The aggregated hourly deviations show large overnight dips and midday peak values consistent with a preserved diurnal pattern overall, despite some within‑day variability.

Holistic conclusion and level relative to the study population
When weighing the relative magnitude of the indicators, two of the most influential features in this dataset are self‑esteem (strong negative correlate with CES‑D) and trait anxiety (strong positive correlate); the participant’s self‑esteem is high while trait anxiety is near average. Several moderate‑strength risk markers are present (high perceived stress, subjective sleep disturbance, limited social activity, intradaily variability, late sleep timing), but these are counterbalanced by protective markers (high self‑esteem, low resting HR, adequate objective sleep duration, low substance use). Given this mix of signals and the relative strengths of correlations in the sample, the most defensible placement is that the participant’s depressive symptom level is near the population mean CES‑D score (i.e., not clearly above or below the sample average). Uncertainty remains, however, because subjective distress indicators (stress, poor sleep, low happiness) suggest vigilance for elevated symptoms if these patterns intensify; direct CES‑D measurement and clinical follow‑up would reduce uncertainty.

Caveats
These inferences are probabilistic and based on group correlations and cross‑sectional behavioral and physiological markers rather than a direct CES‑D score for the participant. Correlations reported in the dataset guided interpretation but do not establish causation; single metrics should not be used alone to classify symptom status. If the goal is precise determination of current depressive symptom severity, use of the participant’s CES‑D score (or repeated CES‑D assessments) is recommended alongside clinical evaluation."
29885,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics, this participant presents a mixed profile of risk and protective features for depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43) and reduced self-esteem (RSES = 33) are notable psychological indicators that tend to covary with higher CES-D scores in this sample, while frequent exercise, relatively high self-rated happiness, high health satisfaction, low resting heart rate, and a stable circadian profile are features that typically relate to lower depressive symptom levels. Objective sleep timing is late and self-reported sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7), which is relevant because sleep disruption commonly co-occurs with higher CES-D scores. Taken together, the evidence tilts toward a modest elevation in depressive symptom risk relative to the study cohort but remains balanced by multiple protective behavioral and physiological markers.

Factors consistent with relatively higher CES-D scores
Several variables in this record are associated with higher depressive symptomatology in this sample. The participant’s STAI–Trait score is elevated (43; Z ≈ 0.17) and this measure shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D in the study (r = 0.81), meaning the participant’s chronic anxiety proneness is an important indicator of elevated depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is lower than the sample mean (RSES = 33; Z ≈ −0.73) and self-esteem is strongly inversely correlated with CES-D here (r = −0.71), so reduced self-esteem is another robust signal in the direction of higher depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is also worse than the clinical cutoff (PSQI = 7; classified as disturbed sleep), and disturbed sleep is a well-established correlate of elevated CES-D; the provided correlations between sleep metrics and CES-D are modest but the PSQI classification is clinically relevant. Objective sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:57), and the wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively high evening arousal (notably a large positive deviation at 9–10 pm, Z ≈ 1.90) that could interfere with timely sleep onset; late sleep timing and evening physiological activation are often linked to worse mood symptoms. Finally, some sedentary leisure time (sedentary hobby 1–2 hours, Z ≈ 1.41) and modest video-game use (Z ≈ 0.96) are small behavioral signals that in this sample weakly trend with higher CES-D.

Factors consistent with relatively lower CES-D scores
There are several protective signs that weigh against a high CES-D inference. The participant reports relatively high current happiness (self-rated = 4.0; Z ≈ 0.55) and high satisfaction with physical health (Z ≈ 0.97), both of which correlate negatively with CES-D in the sample and suggest lower symptom burden. Exercise behavior is frequent (exercising three times per week or more, both alone and with others; Z-scores ≈ 1.07 and 1.23) and exercise correlates negatively with CES-D here, representing a robust behavioral buffer. Wearable circadian metrics indicate a well-structured rhythm: interdaily stability is elevated (value 0.53; Z ≈ 1.0), intradaily variability is low (0.43; Z ≈ −0.81), autocorrelation at 24 h is elevated (Z ≈ 1.06), and amplitude is relatively high (Z ≈ 1.25). These features together indicate a regular, consolidated daily pattern of physiological activity, which in the literature and in this sample is generally protective against depressive symptoms. Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.2 bpm; Z ≈ −0.59), which in this dataset shows a small positive correlation with CES-D (so lower RHR is mildly protective). Perceived stress is slightly below the sample mean (PSS = 20; Z ≈ −0.44), which also supports lower current symptom risk.

Holistic integration and comparison to the sample mean
Balancing the above, the participant shows both risk factors (notably trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, subjective sleep disturbance, late bedtimes and evening physiological arousal) and protective features (regular circadian organization, frequent exercise, higher happiness and health satisfaction, and low resting heart rate). The strongest single signals tending toward higher depressive symptoms are the STAI and RSES values because those scales have the largest correlations with CES-D in this sample; the strongest protective signals are behavioral (exercise) and circadian stability. On net, the profile is most consistent with a depressive symptom level that is near to, and mildly above, the study population mean rather than substantially below it. Using the study sample context (population CES-D mean = 13.3, SD = 9.62), the available evidence supports an inference of a modest elevation in depressive symptoms relative to the cohort mean rather than a pronounced deviation. This conclusion reflects an integration of high-anxiety/low-self-esteem signals with countervailing protective behavioral and physiological features.

Limitations and caveats
These inferences are probabilistic and associative: correlations in the dataset do not establish causation and many correlations provided here are small or moderate. The CES-D value for this participant is not given directly; the assessment above is an interpretation based on correlated measures and wearable-derived signals aggregated across the recording period. Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features are temporally aggregated and should not be read as time-specific trends. Finally, self-report measures (e.g., PSQI, happiness) and wearable metrics provide complementary but distinct information, and any clinical interpretation should incorporate additional clinical assessment if necessary."
79167,"Summary of data sources and analytic approach: The synthesis integrates self-report measures (anxiety, self‑esteem, perceived stress, sleep quality, health satisfaction, activity and social habits) with wearable-derived sleep and heart-rate/circadian metrics (sleep duration and timing statistics, hourly deviations from mesor, and cosinor/non‑parametric circadian features). Where helpful I reference z-scores (participant relative to the study sample) and the published correlations between each metric and CES‑D in this study. Below I first summarize features that point toward relatively lower depressive symptoms, then features that could point in the opposite direction, and finish with a balanced, holistic conclusion comparing the participant to the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.34).

Evidence indicating relatively lower depressive symptomatology
- Self-report affect and trait measures strongly favor lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports high self‑esteem (Rosenberg score Z = +1.24; study correlation with CES‑D = −0.71) and high current happiness (Z = +1.64; correlation = −0.46). Both of these measures have substantial negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample, and the participant’s elevated scores are therefore strong protective indicators.  
- Perceived stress is unusually low (PSS Z = −3.16). Although the PSS–CES‑D correlation here is modest (r ≈ 0.28), such a large negative z-score for stress provides additional evidence against elevated depressive symptoms.  
- Sleep-related indicators are generally favorable. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI) is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5; Z ≈ −0.8), and wearable-derived median nightly sleep is relatively long (median 8 h 11 min; Z = +1.25) with no recorded naps. Longer, subjectively good sleep in this dataset is not associated with higher CES‑D and therefore supports lower symptom burden. Sleep timing variability is moderate but not extreme (sleep start SD ≈ 65 minutes; Z ≈ −0.39).  
- Lifestyle and social behavior are consistent with lower risk: frequent exercise (solo and with others, Zs ≈ +1.1 to +1.6), moderate socializing (1–2 hours, Z ≈ +0.16), low recreational drug use, and high health satisfaction (Z = +2.05; correlation with CES‑D ≈ −0.39). These patterns align with lower CES‑D in the sample.  
- Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.7 bpm; Z ≈ −0.65), and the participant shows pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate declines (large negative deviations overnight) and clear daytime rises, which are consistent with intact sleep‑wake cardiovascular physiology rather than dysregulated arousal. In this dataset higher resting HR modestly associates with higher CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), so the participant’s lower resting HR is another small indicator of lower depressive symptoms.

Evidence indicating features that could be associated with higher depressive symptomatology
- Some wearable circadian rhythm metrics suggest weakened rhythmicity. Interdaily stability (a measure of day‑to‑day regularity) is relatively low (value 0.28; Z ≈ −1.07), and amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (amplitude Z ≈ −1.03). Lower interdaily stability and lower amplitude have, in other studies, been linked to mood disturbance; however, in this dataset the reported correlations between these specific circadian features and CES‑D are small (r values near zero to modest), so their predictive weight is limited.  
- Intradaily variability (fragmentation of activity/physiology within the day) is somewhat elevated (Z ≈ +0.74). Increased intraday fragmentation has been associated with worse mood in some literature; in this sample the correlation with CES‑D is small (≈ −0.05), suggesting only weak evidence.  
- A few hourly heart‑rate deviations in the afternoon and evening are slightly reduced relative to the sample mesor (negative Zs across many daytime hours), which could reflect a lower daytime cardiovascular amplitude. Again, the strength of association between these aggregated hourly deviations and CES‑D in the study is low, so these observations are suggestive but not strong evidence of elevated depressive symptoms.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of strong, high‑weight indicators point toward relatively low depressive symptom levels for this participant. High self‑esteem and high current happiness are especially influential because they show the largest correlations with CES‑D in the study (self‑esteem r ≈ −0.71; STAI r ≈ +0.81 for anxiety, and the participant’s anxiety score is low). Very low perceived stress and favorable sleep quantity/quality, frequent exercise, strong health satisfaction, and healthy substance/use and social patterns further reinforce that impression. Circadian/cardiac signals that might suggest dysregulation (lower interdaily stability, lower amplitude, modestly elevated intradaily variability) are present but are relatively small in magnitude and have weak correlations with CES‑D in the sample; they do not outweigh the stronger self‑report indicators.

Given these convergent data, the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.34). The strongest contributors to that inference are the participant’s high self‑esteem, low perceived stress, elevated happiness, good sleep duration/quality, and regular exercise and social behavior. 

Key caveats
- These inferences are probabilistic and indirect: no CES‑D score for this individual was provided, and wearable circadian metrics are aggregated across days and cannot capture day‑to‑day symptom fluctuations.  
- Correlations reported in the study quantify associations in the sample but do not imply causation; some physiologic deviations could reflect unrelated factors (fitness level, chronotype, class schedule).  
- The circadian metrics that slightly contrast with self‑report (e.g., lower interdaily stability) merit monitoring, because if other clinical or self‑report indicators change, those wearable signals could become more informative.

If useful, I can produce a brief prioritized list of indicators to monitor over time (e.g., self‑esteem/happiness, perceived stress, PSQI, interdaily stability) or translate this synthesis into a concise one‑page summary for a research report."
22455,"Summary and overall inference:
Across the multimodal data, the participant shows a mixture of risk and protective indicators for depressive symptoms. Strong protective signals include relatively low trait anxiety, elevated self-reported happiness and self‑esteem, good subjective sleep quality (PSQI near the “good” cutoff) and regular solitary exercise; risk signals include high perceived stress, very low interpersonal trust, relatively short and variable objective sleep duration, elevated evening sedentary screen time, and somewhat blunted circadian amplitude and day-to-day rhythm stability on heart‑rate measures. Weighing these elements, the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels at or modestly below the study population average; in other words, inferred CES‑D level is below the population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.31) but not dramatically so, given countervailing risk markers.

Features that point toward higher depressive symptoms:
- Perceived stress is elevated (PSS Z = 2.28) and has a positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample, which supports greater current negative affective burden and raises risk for higher depressive symptoms.  
- Interpersonal trust is markedly low (Trust Z = -2.71) and is negatively correlated with CES‑D in the sample; low trust can reflect social withdrawal or reduced perceived support, both relevant to depressive symptomatology.  
- Objective sleep is shorter than the sample average (median 6 h 7 min, Z = -1.33) and sleep duration shows relatively high night-to-night variability (SD 142 min, Z = 0.94), and variability has a modest positive correlation with CES‑D; fragmented or insufficient sleep can exacerbate mood symptoms.  
- Behavioral sedentary time is elevated (3–4 hours daily watching video content, high internet/music use; Zs > +1.5), and these media-use measures have weak positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample; these habits can be both a consequence and a maintaining factor for low mood in some individuals.  
- Several circadian metrics indicate reduced rhythm robustness (low amplitude Z = -1.52, interdaily stability Z = -0.9 and slightly elevated intradaily variability), which are patterns associated in the literature with worse mood regulation; though their sample correlations here are small, they are biologically plausible risk markers.

Features that point toward lower depressive symptoms:
- Trait anxiety is low (STAI Z = -1.31) and the STAI score correlates strongly with CES‑D in this sample; low chronic anxiety is a substantial protective factor against higher depressive symptom scores.  
- Self‑esteem and current happiness are both elevated relative to the sample (Self‑esteem Z = +1.10; Happy Z = +1.64) and both correlate negatively with CES‑D (notably self‑esteem correlates −0.71), which is a robust protective profile against elevated CES‑D.  
- Subjective sleep quality (PSQI) is near the favorable end (PSQI = 5.0, Z = -0.8, classified as “Good Sleep” in this dataset), and the participant reports moderate health satisfaction (Z = +1.96), both associated with lower depressive symptom scores in the sample.  
- Low substance use and a routine of regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z = +1.07) provide behavioral resilience factors that are negatively associated with CES‑D in the sample.  
- Resting heart rate and mesor are lower than average (resting HR Z = -0.52; mesor Z = -1.04) and may reflect relatively good cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline physiological arousal; these features, given their modest correlations with CES‑D in the sample, are not strong drivers of elevated depressive symptoms here.

Wearable circadian and hourly heart‑rate profile interpretation:
- The cosinor-derived amplitude is below the sample mean and interdaily stability is reduced, indicating a relatively blunted and less consistent 24‑hour heart‑rate rhythm. This suggests some attenuation of day–night physiological contrast (less robust circadian structure), which can be associated with mood dysregulation. Intraday variability is only modestly elevated, so the rhythm is somewhat flattened rather than highly fragmented.  
- Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show pronounced above‑mesor values in early morning hours (large positive deviations around 5–7 AM; very high Zs) and substantial below‑mesor deviations in late-night hours (10 PM–midnight strongly negative Zs). The early‑morning spikes likely reflect periods of increased activity or arousal on many days (e.g., consistent morning activity), while the late‑night dips are consistent with physiological quiescence during sleep. These hourly patterns do not by themselves indicate elevated depressive symptoms given their weak correlations with CES‑D, but the overall lower amplitude and modest instability of the rhythm are a subtle risk-consistent signal.

Integrated conclusion:
The participant presents a mixed but overall resilient profile: salient protective psychological factors (low trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem and happiness, regular exercise, and low substance use) argue for lower depressive symptomatology relative to the study sample, while elevated perceived stress, low interpersonal trust, shortened and variable objective sleep, high sedentary media use, and somewhat blunted circadian amplitude constitute meaningful risk indicators. Taken together, these data support an inference that the participant’s depressive symptom level is below the population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.31), though not by a large margin given several countervailing risk markers. Continued monitoring of stress, sleep regularity, social trust/support, and sedentary behaviors would be the most relevant domains for potential intervention or follow‑up."
57443,"Summary and overall impression
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed profile of risk and protective indicators for depressive symptoms. Objective sleep and circadian metrics are generally consistent with regular, adequate sleep and a well-entrained heart-rate rhythm. Self-report measures show relatively high self-esteem and moderate-to-high momentary well-being, alongside elevated perceived stress and a trait anxiety score near the study mean. When these signals are weighed together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.29), although some features indicate modest risk that could push symptoms upward under stress. This conclusion reflects the overall pattern of strong protective psychosocial indicators and stable physiological rhythms outweighing moderate stress/anxiety signals and some small physiological correlates of risk.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Perceived stress (PSS = 25, Z = 0.92) is appreciably above the sample average and is modestly positively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.28). Elevated stress is therefore a relevant risk factor in this profile.  
- Trait anxiety (STAI = 40) is classified as “anxious” in the survey interpretation and STAI scores are strongly correlated with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81). Although this participant’s STAI is close to the sample mean (Z = -0.13), the established strong association between trait anxiety and depressive symptoms increases the plausibility of co-occurring depressive symptoms if anxiety intensifies.  
- Several wearable-derived cardiovascular features show small positive correlations with CES‑D: higher mesor (80.19, Z = 0.85; r ≈ 0.19) and slightly elevated resting heart rate (61.2 bpm, Z = 0.36; r ≈ 0.19). These suggest a modest physiological association with higher symptom levels in this cohort.  
- Some behavioral patterns that are neutral-to-low in the sample (infrequent exercise: 1–2×/month) are linked in other literature to greater depressive symptoms; here the study correlations are small, but the low exercise frequency is a behavioral consideration that could contribute to risk if other factors change.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg score = 39, Z = 0.11) and strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ -0.71). This is one of the most robust protective indicators in the data.  
- Current self-reported happiness (score = 4, Z = 0.55; r ≈ -0.46) and satisfaction with physical health (Z = 0.22; r ≈ -0.39) both point toward better-than-average subjective well-being and are negatively associated with depressive symptoms.  
- Objective sleep is consistent with low risk: median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 14 min (Z = 0.06) and exceptionally low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 42 minutes, Z = -1.33). The participant has an earlier-to-midnight typical sleep onset (median start ≈ 00:24) and essentially no naps. These sleep characteristics—adequate duration and high stability—are generally protective against depressive symptoms; the PSQI score of 5 (Z = -0.8) further indicates relatively good subjective sleep quality.  
- Circadian and activity rhythms measured from heart rate are relatively regular: interdaily stability = 0.50 (Z = 0.75), autocorrelation at 24 h elevated (Z = 1.15), amplitude moderately above average (Z = 0.69). Intradaily variability is near the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.03). Overall, these rhythm metrics reflect a well-entrained and regular daily structure, which in this dataset shows either negligible or modest negative associations with CES‑D and thus act as protective features.  
- Low substance use and absence of daily naps are additional behavioral markers that align with lower risk in this sample.

Integrated interpretation and relative placement vs. the population mean
Balancing the signals, the participant exhibits several strong protective psychosocial and physiological indicators (high self-esteem, moderate-to-high momentary happiness, stable and sufficient sleep, and regular circadian heart-rate rhythms) that, in this dataset, have relatively large negative associations with CES‑D (notably self-esteem). Opposing these are elevated perceived stress, an average-but-notably relevant trait-anxiety score (given the strong STAI–CES‑D correlation), and modest physiological correlates (slightly higher mesor and resting heart rate). Taken together, the pattern most consistently supports an inferred depressive symptom level below the population mean CES‑D score of 13.29. This is not a claim of absence of symptoms, but a probabilistic placement: the participant’s overall multi-modal profile is more consistent with lower-than-average CES‑D scores in this cohort, with the caveat that elevated stress and trait anxiety could increase depressive symptoms if those stressors persist or intensify.

Key caveats
- The conclusion is an inference based on correlational associations and proxies rather than a direct CES‑D score; individual trajectories can differ.  
- Several correlations in the dataset are modest in magnitude; therefore small changes in stress, sleep, or anxiety could shift inferred symptom level.  
- Wearable-derived metrics are aggregated across the semester and may mask episodic dysregulation; self-report captures only a snapshot."
94579,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile presents a mixture of protective and risk-related signals for depressive symptoms. Several strong protective markers appear in the self-report and behavioral data (notably high self-esteem, frequent exercise, low perceived stress, minimal substance use, and generally good subjective sleep quality), while some wearable-derived and trait indicators point to vulnerabilities (notably pronounced night-to-night sleep variability, a late median sleep onset, and elevated trait anxiety). Circadian heart-rate metrics overall suggest preserved daily structure and a clear daytime activity peak. Taken together, the pattern is heterogeneous; on balance the evidence indicates depressive symptom levels near the study population mean (Population CES-D mean = 13.28), with some specific areas of risk that could raise symptom burden if they persist or worsen.

Features indicating relatively higher CES-D risk: The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 44, z = 0.27) is notable because STAI scores in this sample show a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), making anxiety proneness a prominent risk factor for elevated depressive symptoms. Sleep irregularity is another concern: the standard deviation of nightly sleep duration is very high (242 minutes; z = 3.21) and sleep start time variability is also elevated (SD = 153 minutes; z = 1.54); both of these sleep-regularity metrics are positively correlated with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.19–0.21) and are known to associate with higher depressive symptoms. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈ 02:07 AM), which can be associated with circadian misalignment and mood vulnerability in some individuals. Self-reported current happiness is somewhat low (score = 3, z = -0.53) and interpersonal trust is modest (score = 3, z = -0.46); these affective and social indicators correlate negatively with wellbeing in the sample (correlations with CES-D in the expected directions), and they represent additional, though moderate, risk signals.

Features indicating relatively lower CES-D risk: Several protective factors are present and relatively strong. Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg score = 37; z = -0.17) and self-esteem in this sample has a large negative correlation with CES-D (r = -0.71), a powerful buffer against depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is lower than the sample average (PSS = 17; z = -1.26), which also argues for lower current symptom burden (PSS correlates positively, but modestly, with CES-D). The participant reports frequent exercise and sports participation (three times a week or more; z scores for exercise up to ~1.6), behaviors that show modest negative correlations with CES-D in this sample and which are generally protective. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; z = -0.8) is in the “good” range here, and objective wearable-derived circadian features (moderate-to-high amplitude, interdaily stability z ≈ 0.67, and low intradaily fragmentation) indicate an overall preserved and relatively regular heart-rate rhythm — features that are generally associated with lower depression risk. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.6 bpm; z = -0.07), which in this dataset shows a small positive correlation with CES-D (so a lower RHR is not suggestive of elevated symptoms).

Synthesis and comparative interpretation: The strongest single risk indicator in the profile is trait anxiety, given its large sample-level association with CES-D; the most influential protective indicator is high self-esteem, which also has a strong inverse association with CES-D. Objective sleep irregularity (very large night-to-night variability) is a clear behavioral vulnerability and is one of the most divergent wearable-derived features relative to the sample. However, multiple convergent protective signals (low perceived stress, frequent exercise, minimal substance use, good subjective sleep quality, and intact circadian amplitude/stability) temper the risk profile. Because of this mixture of substantial protective factors counterbalancing a few notable risk features, the overall pattern of evidence is most consistent with depressive symptom levels near the study population mean (Population CES-D mean = 13.28), rather than clearly above or well below it. This conclusion reflects probabilistic inference from correlational signals in the provided measures rather than a direct CES-D score for the participant.

Practical implications and priorities: Clinically relevant targets suggested by the profile are modulation of trait anxiety and reduction of sleep timing and duration variability. Interventions that stabilize sleep timing (regular bedtime/wake times), address anxiety-proneness (e.g., cognitive-behavioral strategies, stress-management), and preserve the participant’s high self-esteem and regular physical activity are likely to have the greatest impact on lowering risk for elevated depressive symptoms. These recommendations are observationally grounded in the provided multi-modal data and should be interpreted in light of the absence of a direct CES-D score for this individual and the correlational nature of the measures."
29257,"Summary: The available self-report and wearable data present a mixed but overall reassuring profile with respect to depressive symptomatology. Several robust protective indicators (low trait anxiety, relatively high self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, low-to-moderate perceived stress, and regular daytime physiological arousal) contrast with a smaller set of risk-relevant features (markedly long daily music-listening, elevated night-to-night variability in sleep duration, and a consistently late sleep onset). Taken together, these signals suggest that this participant’s overall level of depressive symptoms is likely below the study sample mean CES-D (population mean = 13.34), probably near or below the sample median (50th percentile = 11.5). This inference is provisional because a direct CES-D score for the participant is not supplied and the wearable correlations with CES-D are generally small.

Evidence pointing toward lower depressive symptoms: Multiple survey measures that are strongly and conventionally associated with lower depression are present. Trait anxiety (STAI = 31, z = -1.02) is substantially below the sample mean; given the high correlation between trait anxiety and CES-D in the study (r ≈ 0.81), this is a substantial protective signal. Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES z = 1.1) and the study correlation between self-esteem and CES-D is strongly negative (r ≈ -0.71), another sizable protective factor. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, z = -1.26), perceived stress is below average (PSS z = -0.71), and the participant reports satisfactory health (health satisfaction z = 0.72); each of these measures has small-to-moderate associations with CES-D in the sample consistent with lower depressive symptom burden. Objective physiology also shows normative cardiovascular values (mesor and resting heart rate close to sample mean) and a clear day–night separation in heart rate (acrophase ~5:43 PM and sensible daytime elevations), which together do not indicate marked physiological dysregulation commonly seen with higher depressive symptoms.

Evidence pointing toward higher depressive symptoms or increased risk: A few measures are associated with elevated CES-D in the sample and are present here. The participant reports very high daily music listening (>4 hours; z = 2.06), and in this dataset greater listening time correlates positively with CES-D (r ≈ 0.26). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively large (sleep duration SD ≈ 151 minutes, z = 1.14), and variability in sleep has a positive correlation with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.21), suggesting irregular sleep may be a modest risk factor. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 01:32 AM), which—although its direct correlation with CES-D is not provided—can interact with social/behavioral patterns in ways that sometimes align with mood symptoms. Finally, a few hourly heart-rate deviations during the deep night hours show small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ 0.15–0.16 for 2–5 AM), which could indicate that subtle nocturnal autonomic signatures are modestly associated with higher symptom levels; however, those correlations are small and the participant’s overall heart-rate mesor and resting heart rate remain near average.

Circadian and wearable rhythm interpretation: Nonparametric circadian metrics are mixed but do not strongly point toward high depressive symptomatology. Interdaily stability is lower than average (value = 0.26, z = -1.23), indicating that the timing of day–night activity shows less day-to-day regularity, but the correlation of interdaily stability with CES-D in this sample is negligible (r ≈ -0.01). Intradaily variability is modestly below average (z = -0.60), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (z = 0.81), suggesting that while day-to-day timing shifts occur, there is still an overall consistent 24-hour structure. The amplitude of the cosinor rhythm is somewhat attenuated (z = -0.75), and amplitude has a small negative correlation with CES-D (r ≈ -0.10), indicating any circadian flattening is a weak risk signal in this dataset. Overall, the wearable circadian features provide only weak-to-moderate information for depressive symptoms here.

Sleep behavior synthesis: Objective sleep duration is slightly above average (median ≈ 7 h 49 min, z = 0.79), and there are essentially no reported naps (z = -0.86). Subjective sleep quality is good. These two facts weigh toward lower depressive symptoms. The main sleep-related concern is variability in sleep duration (high SD) and a late habitual sleep onset (~1:30 AM). High variability introduces instability that, in this sample, is modestly associated with higher CES-D scores. Because subjective sleep quality is good despite irregular timing, the functional impact of the variability should be interpreted cautiously—sleep quality may be preserved even with irregular schedule, which is less suggestive of mood disturbance than chronic poor-quality sleep.

Behavioral and social context: The participant engages in exercise (including with others) at least 1–2 times per week, reports low recreational drug use, has reasonable academic performance, and spends modest time on socializing and Internet use; these behaviors generally align with lower risk for depressive symptoms. The prominent exception is extensive time listening to music, which in this dataset has a modest positive relationship with CES-D; the direction of that association is not necessarily causal and may reflect compensatory or leisure patterns that correlate with mood.

Holistic conclusion and uncertainty: Balancing all available evidence, the preponderance of relatively strong protective signals (especially low trait anxiety and high self-esteem, both strongly correlated with CES-D in the sample) outweigh the smaller risk signals (high music-listening, high sleep-duration variability, late sleep timing). Therefore the most consistent inference is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is below the study sample mean CES-D score of 13.34—likely near or below the sample median (11.5). Confidence in this inference is tempered by the absence of the participant’s actual CES-D score and by some wearable-derived features that show only weak correlations with depressive symptoms in this dataset; consequently the conclusion should be treated as probabilistic, not definitive."
49539,"Summary and overall inference
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant displays a mixture of protective and risk-related features for depressive symptoms. On balance, the preponderance of indicators (notably very low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem, low resting heart rate and mesor, and consistent sleep duration with low night‑to‑night variability) point toward a level of depressive symptoms that is likely below the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.34). This inference is probabilistic and not diagnostic: several signals (disturbed subjective sleep, late habitual sleep timing, marked intraday fragmentation of heart‑rate rhythms and a pronounced evening/late‑evening heart‑rate elevation) suggest areas of potential vulnerability that temper confidence in a uniformly low symptom estimate.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Low trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score is notably low (score = 23, Z ≈ −1.81), and because trait anxiety correlates strongly and positively with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), this is a robust protective indicator.  
- Positive self‑view and social/health resources: Self‑esteem is comparatively high (RSES Z ≈ +0.96; correlation with CES‑D r ≈ −0.71), and interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are above average (Trust Z ≈ +0.83; Health satisfaction Z ≈ +0.80; both have negative correlations with CES‑D), consistent with lower depressive symptomatology.  
- Low physiological arousal baseline and sleep regularity: Resting heart rate and MESOR are low (RHR Z ≈ −1.23; MESOR Z ≈ −1.57), which—given small positive correlations of these metrics with CES‑D in this sample—align with fewer symptoms. Median nightly sleep duration is within a typical range (≈7 h 20 m, Z ≈ +0.18) and night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration and sleep start time are lower than the sample average (sleep duration SD Z ≈ −1.47; sleep start SD Z ≈ −0.96), suggesting stable sleep patterns that are generally protective.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms or vulnerability
- Subjective sleep disturbance and late sleep timing: The PSQI score is 6 (classified as disturbed sleep; Z ≈ −0.33), which, despite only a small Z deviation, indicates clinically relevant subjective sleep difficulties and often co‑occurs with higher depressive symptoms. The participant’s habitual sleep start time is late (median ≈ 01:45), which can be associated with mood symptoms in some individuals.  
- Circadian fragmentation and evening physiological arousal: Intradaily variability from heart‑rate rhythms is elevated (IV value 0.83, Z ≈ +2.01), indicating greater fragmentation of activity/rest physiology within days; although the direct correlation with CES‑D here is small, elevated IV is often observed in mood and sleep disturbance. There is an unusually large positive deviation from mesor at the 11:00 PM–12:00 AM hour (value 35.55, Z ≈ +4.79), pointing to atypically high evening heart rate across days, which could reflect late‑evening physiological arousal, sleep onset difficulty, or irregular evening activity—factors that can relate to worse mood.  
- Moderate perceived stress and lower current positive affect: Perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS score = 22, Z ≈ +0.10; r with CES‑D ≈ +0.28) and current self‑reported happiness is somewhat below average (Z ≈ −0.53; r ≈ −0.46), both of which are associated with higher depressive symptoms in the sample.

Integrated interpretation and caveats
Taken together, protective features—especially the very low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem—carry strong weight because they are strongly correlated with CES‑D in this sample and have substantial Z departures from the mean. Physiological and behavioral data (low resting HR, stable sleep duration, low day‑to‑day sleep variability) further support an inference of depressive symptom levels below the sample mean. Conversely, the participant shows meaningful indicators of evening arousal and circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability and the pronounced 11–12 PM heart‑rate elevation), plus subjective sleep disturbance and moderately elevated stress/higher negative affect, which are plausible contributors to elevated depressive symptoms for some individuals. Because some of these physiological signals have small direct correlations with CES‑D in the sample, their presence raises caution but does not, by itself, outweigh the stronger protective signals.

Bottom line relative to the study population mean
Considering the full multimodal profile and the relative magnitudes of Z‑scores and known correlations with CES‑D, the participant’s overall pattern most consistently aligns with a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean CES‑D score of 13.34, though there are specific sleep/circadian markers and moderate stress/low positive affect that represent possible areas of vulnerability and merit monitoring. Limitations include that some associations are weak in this sample and cosinor/aggregate heart‑rate features are summary measures; inferences should be corroborated with the participant’s CES‑D score and longitudinal symptom data where available."
63904,"Summary of indicators that align with relatively higher depressive symptomatology:
The self-report profile contains several strong and convergent signals associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI = 53, z = 1.16) is substantially above the sample mean and correlates highly with CES-D in this dataset (r = 0.81), indicating a robust relationship between chronic anxiety proneness and depressive symptom burden for this cohort. Low global self-esteem (Rosenberg = 30, z = -1.15) is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which in combination with the elevated trait anxiety provides two of the most clinically relevant predictors of higher depressive scores. Current affect reports further support this pattern: very low self-reported happiness (current = 2.0, z = -1.61; r with CES-D = -0.46) and relatively low trust in others (z = -2.07; r = -0.40) are consistent with elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s PSQI exceeds the common clinical cut-point for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), and although the PSQI z-score is modest, subjective sleep disturbance is often linked to greater depressive symptoms. Behavioral habits that tend to co-occur with higher depression are also present: almost no exercise (exercised alone/with others = “not at all”, z-scores strongly negative) and relatively limited engagement in recreational hobbies (music, reading) are consistent with behavioral withdrawal and reduced activity, patterns commonly associated with higher CES-D scores in this sample.

Summary of indicators that align with relatively lower depressive symptomatology or protective functioning:
Several objective and functional indicators point toward preserved functioning that could mitigate depressive symptom severity. Academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.83–3.86), suggesting intact cognitive/occupational functioning and sustained goal-directed behavior. Wearable-derived circadian regularity is relatively high: interdaily stability (value = 0.53, z = 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (z = 1.06) indicate a consistent daily structure across the recording period, a pattern that is generally protective against mood dysregulation (and in these data shows only trivial correlations with CES-D). Resting heart rate and mesor values are near the sample mean (resting HR = 60.5 bpm, mesor = 76.7), and the hourly aggregate HR deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline and clear daytime increases—an orthodox diurnal profile rather than a blunted or flattened rhythm. Substance use is effectively absent (no alcohol or recreational drug use), which reduces risk related to comorbid substance-related mood effects. Finally, self-reported social time (socializing 2–3 hours/day, z ≈ 0.95) indicates some preserved social contact rather than isolation.

Integration and interpretation across modalities:
When these sources are integrated, the profile is mixed but weighted toward indicators of elevated depressive symptoms. The strongest and most predictive signals in this dataset—high trait anxiety and low self-esteem—both have large correlations with CES-D and are clearly present in this participant; low current happiness and reduced trust further amplify that pattern. Objective physiology and circadian structure do not show marked dysregulation; the participant displays a regular heart rate rhythm, a normal resting heart rate, and a clear nocturnal decline in heart rate. These objective features suggest preserved physiological regulation and daily routine, which are likely to moderate symptom expression. Short habitual sleep duration (median ~5 h 49 min, z = -1.69) and a late median sleep start time (≈ 1:34 AM) constitute notable behavioral risk factors for mood problems, even though in this dataset the direct correlation between sleep duration and CES-D is small. Reduced physical activity and limited engagement in recreational hobbies are additional behavioral features that align with greater depressive symptom risk.

Overall comparison to the study population mean CES-D:
Balancing the evidence, the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the population mean CES-D for this study sample. The combination of high trait anxiety and low self-esteem—two of the strongest correlates of CES-D here—together with low current happiness and disturbed subjective sleep make it likely the participant’s CES-D would fall above the sample mean (population mean = 13.26). This inference is tempered by objective markers of preserved circadian regularity, normal resting heart rate, strong academic performance, and some social engagement, which argue against severe functional impairment.

Limitations and uncertainty:
This conclusion is inferential rather than diagnostic. Correlations vary in magnitude across measures and many wearable metrics show only weak associations with CES-D in this sample. Aggregated hourly HR values and cosinor-derived circadian metrics summarize broad patterns and cannot replace day-to-day symptom reporting. Therefore, while the pattern of self-report measures and behavioral habits reasonably suggests depressive symptoms above the sample mean, direct CES-D scoring or clinical assessment would be required for confirmation."
20335,"Summary conclusion
Based on the combined self-report and wearable-derived indicators, the balance of evidence points toward an overall depressive symptom level below the study sample mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.34). Multiple robust protective signals (notably very low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, elevated current happiness ratings, frequent exercise and social activity, good subjective sleep quality, and relatively regular circadian structure) outweigh the more limited risk signals in the available data. This conclusion is probabilistic and not definitive—several behavioral and physiological features suggest areas of relative vulnerability that warrant attention—but on balance the participant’s profile is more consistent with CES‑D scores below the sample mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
Several self‑report measures that typically covary with lower depressive symptoms are prominent. Trait anxiety is very low (STAI = 23, Z = −1.81), self‑esteem is notably high (RSES Z = 1.66, with a large negative correlation to CES‑D in the sample), and the participant’s current happiness rating is high (Z = 1.64). Perceived stress is below the study mean (PSS Z = −0.71), and satisfaction with physical health is elevated (Z = 1.3). Behavioral supports include relatively frequent exercise (exercising alone three+ times per week, Z = 1.07) and substantial time socializing with friends (3–4 hours, Z = 1.74), both of which typically relate to lower depressive symptoms. Objective circadian regularity is also strong: interdaily stability is above average (0.57, Z = 1.33) and the autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Z ≈ 0.9), indicating a relatively stable day‑to‑day heart‑rate rhythm—features generally associated with better mood regulation. Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5, Z = −0.8), and the participant’s sleep timing is consistent (sleep start SD Z = −1.24), which also supports resilience against depressive symptoms.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms or potential vulnerability
There are a few indicators that could be interpreted as modest risk factors. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat below the sample mean (6 h 35 m, Z = −0.74), which can be associated with mood vulnerability when coupled with other stressors. The participant reports above‑average engagement in sedentary hobbies and video games (sedentary hobby Z = 2.01; video game time Z = 1.71), which in this sample are weakly positively correlated with CES‑D. Wearable measures show elevated intraday variability (Z = 0.81) and a somewhat raised amplitude and mesor (amplitude Z = 0.9; mesor Z = 0.57) and small positive correlations of mesor and resting heart rate with CES‑D—suggesting modestly higher cardiovascular activation overall. Of particular note is an unusually large positive aggregate deviation from the mesor in the 12–1 AM hour (value Z = 3.66), indicating elevated heart rate relative to the participant’s average around midnight; such late‑night physiological arousal can reflect behavioral activation at late hours or occasional nights of increased arousal, both of which sometimes co‑occur with mood symptoms. Importantly, the correlations between many of these wearable features and CES‑D are small in magnitude in this sample, so these findings should be viewed as potential risk signals rather than strong evidence of elevated depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and caveats
Taken together, the weight of evidence favors a lower than average level of depressive symptoms relative to the study sample (i.e., likely below the population CES‑D mean of 13.34). Strong protective psychosocial indicators (very low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, high reported happiness, social engagement, exercise, and consistent circadian stability) are the most diagnostically informative features in this dataset and are supported by relatively small or mixed physiological associations. Areas for monitoring include somewhat short average sleep duration, late sleep timing with notable late‑night heart‑rate elevation (12–1 AM), and high engagement in sedentary leisure that correlate weakly with higher CES‑D in the sample; these could represent modifiable targets if mood symptoms emerge or worsen. Finally, the wearable correlations to CES‑D in this sample are generally modest, so inferences from physiological signals should be interpreted alongside self‑report and functional indicators rather than used in isolation."
35031,"Summary of features that point toward relatively lower depressive symptomatology:
The self-report profile contains multiple robust signals typically associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 27, z = -1.41) is well below the sample mean; given the strong positive correlation between STAI and CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.81), this low anxiety score is a major protective indicator. Global self‑esteem is elevated (Rosenberg-like score = 43, z = 0.68) and the correlation between self‑esteem and CES‑D is strongly negative (r ≈ -0.71), further supporting lower depressive symptom levels. Perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS = 18, z = -0.98) and subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5, z = -0.8); both of these patterns are generally associated with reduced CES‑D scores in the study sample. Behaviorally, the participant reports regular socializing (2–3 hours, z = 0.95) and modest physical activity (exercise 1–2×/week), which are also conventionally protective against depressive symptoms. Taken together, the combination of low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, lower perceived stress, and subjectively adequate sleep provides multiple convergent signals that the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely lower than the study population mean.

Features that point toward relatively higher depressive symptomatology or physiological stress:
Several wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics suggest elevated autonomic/physiological activation and reduced circadian regularity, which in other work relate to higher depressive symptoms or risk. Resting heart rate (75.5 bpm, z = 2.06) and mesor of heart rate (82.2, z = 1.13) are both elevated relative to the sample; the mesor and resting heart rate show modest positive correlations with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.2), so these elevations represent a physiological signal in the direction of higher depressive symptoms. Circadian consistency metrics are attenuated: interdaily stability is low (0.19, z = -1.81) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is also unusually low (z ≈ -1.87), while intradaily variability is relatively high (0.71, z = 1.16). The circadian amplitude is comparatively reduced (amplitude z = -1.85). These features indicate a relatively damped and less stable heart‑rate circadian rhythm across the recording period; although correlations with CES‑D are small-to-moderate in this sample, circadian dampening and instability can reflect physiological dysregulation that is sometimes observed with higher depressive symptom burden. Additional minor considerations include alcohol use reported at 1–2 times per week (z ≈ 1.0) and a median sleep start time around midnight (00:16); these do not by themselves strongly predict higher CES‑D here but are worth noting in the context of the disrupted circadian markers.

Sleep and behavioral pattern interpretation (integrative):
Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 hours 3 minutes, z = 1.08) with modest night‑to‑night variability (SD ≈ 91 minutes), and mean daily naps are low (0.14, z = 0.82). Subjective sleep quality is classified as “good” (PSQI = 5). These sleep metrics present a mixed but overall non‑problematic picture: sufficient total sleep and reasonable subjective sleep quality are generally protective against depressive symptoms, and the lack of large sleep variability argues against pronounced sleep disruption. At the same time, the mismatch between relatively good sleep metrics and the circadian rhythm fragmentation seen in heart rate (low interdaily stability, low amplitude) suggests that physiological circadian regulation may be blunted even when subjective sleep quantity/quality is adequate. That pattern can occur in otherwise functioning individuals and does not necessarily imply clinically high depressive symptoms, but it is a relevant physiological observation.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean:
Balancing the multiple sources of evidence, the preponderance of strong psychosocial indicators (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, lower perceived stress, good subjective sleep) points toward depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.33). Physiological data introduce some caution because elevated resting heart rate and reduced circadian regularity are modest signals in the direction of higher CES‑D, but their correlations with CES‑D in this sample are small-to-moderate and they do not outweigh the stronger self‑report protective signals. In summary, the integrated profile is most consistent with an inferred CES‑D level below the population mean, while flagging physiological circadian/ autonomic markers (elevated resting HR, low interdaily stability and amplitude) as areas for potential monitoring or further assessment if clinically warranted.

Caveats:
This interpretation synthesizes correlational associations and summary metrics rather than a contemporaneous CES‑D score for the participant; direct measurement of CES‑D would provide a definitive point estimate. Also, physiological markers and their psychological implications can be influenced by factors not captured here (e.g., fitness level, medications, illness, caffeine, timing of device wear), so the physiological signals should be interpreted in context and, if concerning, followed up with targeted assessment."
88185,"Protective features suggesting lower depressive symptomatology
The participant shows multiple psychosocial and behavioral indicators that, taken together, point toward relatively low CES-D symptom burden. Trait anxiety is low (STAI = 29; Z = -1.22), and the STAI–Trait scale has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), which makes a low STAI score a particularly informative protective sign. Self-esteem is high relative to the sample (Rosenberg score reported high; Z = 0.82) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D (r = -0.71), another robust indicator favoring fewer depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is well above average (Happy = 5.0; Z = 1.64), perceived stress is not elevated (PSS = 20, Z = -0.44), and reported interpersonal trust is above average (Z = 0.83); these survey signals all align with lower depressive symptom levels. Behavioral markers of engagement and functioning—regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), low substance use (no alcohol or recreational drugs), sustained academic performance (high GPAs), and reported socializing of 2–3 hours daily—also support the inference of relatively low depressive symptoms.

Physiological and circadian indicators consistent with lower depressive symptoms
Wearable-derived cardiac and circadian metrics provide converging physiological evidence of relative resilience. The participant’s heart-rate circadian rhythm appears regular and robust: interdaily stability is relatively high (value = 0.57; Z = 1.33), amplitude is elevated (Z = 1.06), intradaily variability is modestly low (Z = -0.32), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is positive (Z = 0.56). These combined features indicate a structured, stable day–night pattern of physiological arousal—pattern components that are typically associated with better mood and lower depressive symptom severity. Resting heart rate is on the lower side of the sample (57.3 bpm; Z = -0.10), and the aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dips and daytime elevations, consistent with a normal nocturnal decline in arousal. Taken together, the circadian and cardiovascular profile argues against high chronic physiological hyperarousal that often accompanies higher depressive symptoms.

Features that are more consistent with elevated depressive symptoms or risk
There are nonetheless specific signals that could indicate modest risk or areas of concern. Subjective sleep disturbance is present: the PSQI score is 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), which is above the common clinical cutoff and is often linked with greater depressive symptoms. Wearable sleep data show a somewhat shortened median sleep duration (6 hours 37 minutes; Z = -0.70) and a very late median sleep start time (around 02:25 AM). Late habitual sleep timing and shorter nocturnal sleep are both associated in many studies with increased depressive symptoms or worse mood regulation, and the dataset’s cross-metric correlations (e.g., some positive correlations between nocturnal heart-rate deviations and CES-D) caution that sleep-related issues may modestly elevate symptom risk. Another behavioral correlate with a small positive sample correlation to CES-D is high listening-to-music time (>4 hours; Z = 2.06, r ≈ 0.26); this could reflect either a coping behavior or, less commonly, a marker of withdrawal/rumination depending on context. Finally, some daytime heart-rate elevations during certain hours and a small positive correlation between resting heart rate and CES-D (r ≈ 0.19) suggest minor physiological associations with higher symptom scores, although these effects are small in magnitude.

Integrated appraisal and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the participant presents a predominance of protective psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological signals (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, elevated momentary happiness, regular exercise, low substance use, strong circadian stability) against a more circumscribed set of sleep-related and behavioral risk factors (PSQI > 5, late sleep timing, somewhat short median sleep, high reported music-listening). Given the relative strength and number of the protective indicators—especially the strong, highly CES-D–related measures of low trait anxiety and high self-esteem—versus the more modest magnitude of the sleep-related and behavioral risk signals, the overall pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.32). In other words, based on the multimodal evidence available, the participant’s inferred depressive-symptom level is likely below the population mean rather than near or above it, though targeted attention to sleep timing and subjective sleep quality would be a reasonable area for monitoring or intervention because those factors could elevate risk over time.

Caveats
This appraisal integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable metrics and uses sample correlations as interpretive guidance; it does not substitute for a direct CES-D score or clinical assessment. Correlations in the dataset indicate associations but do not establish causality, and several measures (e.g., listening-to-music duration, late sleep timing) could reflect adaptive coping in context rather than pathology. If there is concern about mood or sleep, direct assessment with a CES-D score and a focused sleep evaluation would provide the most definitive information."
35344,"Elevated symptom indicators (evidence pointing toward higher CES-D score):
The survey profile contains several strong, convergent indicators associated with higher depressive symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 62, Z = 2.05) is markedly elevated and has a very high positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), making this the single most salient risk correlate in the dataset. Low global self‑esteem (RSES = 27, Z ≈ −1.57) is also strongly associated with higher CES-D (r ≈ −0.71) and reinforces risk. Current self‑reported happiness is low (score = 2, Z ≈ −1.61; correlation with CES-D ≈ −0.46), and perceived stress is above the sample mean (PSS = 24, Z ≈ 0.65; r ≈ 0.28), both of which are consistent with increased depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 9, Z ≈ 1.05) further contributes risk: although objective sleep duration is near or above average, the participant reports clinically relevant sleep problems, which commonly co-occur with higher CES-D scores. Physiologically, resting heart rate and MESOR are modestly elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 63.8, MESOR = 78.0; Z ≈ 0.6 each) and have small positive correlations with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19), which is consistent with a low-to-moderate autonomic arousal pattern often seen with affective distress.

Protective or mitigating indicators (evidence pointing toward lower CES-D score):
Several behavioral and physiological features suggest relative resilience or lower depressive symptom risk. Objective sleep duration is relatively healthy (median 7 h 47 min; Z ≈ 0.74) and daytime napping is effectively absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z ≈ −0.86), which are generally protective for mood. The participant reports regular physical activity (exercising alone three times per week or more; sports 1–2×/week; exercise Z-scores ≈ 0.9–1.1), behaviors that tend to associate with lower depressive symptoms (sample correlations are small but negative). Interdaily stability and low-to-moderate intradaily variability of heart rate rhythms (IS ≈ 0.44, IV ≈ 0.56; Zs near 0) indicate a reasonably structured circadian pattern rather than marked fragmentation; circadian amplitude and a clear acrophase (~3:51 PM) further reflect intact day–night rhythmicity, features that are typically protective against depressive symptomatology. Social and substance variables are mixed but not strongly adverse: trust in others is relatively high (trust Z ≈ 1.79) and recreational drug use is absent; academic performance (high GPA) and moderate health satisfaction also suggest functioning that mitigates risk.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate patterns (integrative interpretation):
The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir and daytime elevations, with acrophase in the mid‑afternoon and daytime amplitudes comparable to the study distribution. These objective circadian markers (moderate interdaily stability, modest intraday variability, clear daytime peaks) indicate a generally regular cardiac rhythm across days rather than the flattened or highly irregular rhythm sometimes seen with more severe depressive states. At the same time, subtle physiological signs—slightly higher MESOR and resting heart rate—align with the survey indicators of elevated arousal or distress. Importantly, objective sleep duration is adequate, but the participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI; this subjective–objective dissociation is relevant clinically because perceived sleep problems predict mood symptoms independently of duration.

Holistic synthesis and relative standing versus the study population:
Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most weighty indicators in this case are the very high trait anxiety and the substantially low self‑esteem, both of which are highly correlated with CES‑D in this sample and therefore carry more inferential weight than measures with weak correlations. Together with low reported happiness and elevated PSQI, these features point toward a depressive symptom level that is likely above the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.27). Protective elements—regular objective sleep duration, consistent circadian patterning, regular exercise, high interpersonal trust, absence of substance misuse, and strong academic functioning—reduce the likelihood of extreme or severe depressive symptomatology and suggest the participant’s symptoms may be moderate rather than very severe. In sum: the multimodal profile most plausibly indicates CES‑D symptom levels above the population mean, with particularly strong contributors being elevated trait anxiety and low self‑esteem, while regular sleep duration, structured circadian physiology, exercise, and social/trust resources temper that risk.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation:
This synthesis weights indicators according to the strength of their correlations with CES‑D in the sample and the relative magnitude of deviation from the cohort mean. It does not constitute a diagnostic statement; wearable metrics are temporally aggregated and cannot substitute for clinical assessment. The subjective report of poor sleep despite adequate objective duration is a notable source of internal distress and warrants consideration alongside the strong anxiety and low self‑esteem signals."
31175,"Summary of self-report indicators
The survey data show a mixed pattern of risk and protection for depressive symptoms. Notable risk-related responses include a PSQI score of 8 (Z = 0.59), indicating subjectively disturbed sleep, a relatively elevated perceived stress score of 24 (Z = 0.65), and a self-reported current happiness rating below the sample mean (happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53). Trait anxiety (STAI = 40) is near the sample mean (Z = -0.13) but the STAI–CES-D correlation in this sample is large (r = 0.81), which highlights the relevance of anxiety-proneness to depressive symptom variance even though this participant’s STAI value is only slightly below average. In contrast, several protective self-report features are present: self-esteem is above the sample mean (RSES Z = 0.40; note the instrument’s negative correlation with CES-D, r = -0.71), reported overall health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.63), and the participant reports frequent exercise and sports activity (exercise/sports Z-scores 1.07 and 1.58 respectively), which tend to be associated with lower depressive symptoms in this cohort.

Sleep and sleep-regularity derived from wearables
Wearable sleep metrics indicate long and highly variable sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is very long (9 h 34 min, Z = 2.96) and the standard deviation of sleep duration is extreme (249 min, Z = 3.37). Those two features—prolonged sleep duration and large night-to-night inconsistency—are both associated in the literature and in this sample with greater depressive symptomatology; here the sleep-duration SD shows a positive correlation with CES-D (r ≈ 0.21). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI) is elevated, consistent with the wearable pattern of marked variability. At the same time, mean nap frequency is low and the median sleep onset time is a typical late-evening hour (≈23:17), so the disturbance appears characterized more by hypersomnia and irregular duration than by frequent daytime napping or extreme delayed timing.

Circadian and heart-rate physiology
Circadian summary features are mixed. Non-parametric measures indicate relatively low intradaily variability (IV = 0.30, Z = -1.73), suggesting consolidated day–night structure rather than fragmented activity, which is typically protective against depressive symptoms. Parametric circadian features show a relatively low amplitude (8.28, Z = -0.81) and a lower MESOR (64.59, Z = -1.28); lower amplitude can reflect blunted circadian modulation of physiology, a pattern sometimes associated with depressive symptoms, although the amplitude–CES-D correlation here is modest (r ≈ -0.10). Resting heart rate is low–normal (57.8 bpm, Z = -0.04), and hourly aggregated deviations show clear daytime elevations (peaks in mid-afternoon) and lower evening/night values, indicating preserved daytime activation and a typical acrophase (~3:34 PM). Overall, physiological rhythms show preserved day–night structure but somewhat attenuated amplitude.

Behavioral and social activity
Behavioral survey items indicate notable protective social and activity behaviors: the participant reports substantial socializing (3–4 hours daily, Z = 1.74) and frequent solo exercise and sports (Z > 1), both of which are associated with lower CES-D scores in this sample (exercise and social engagement correlations are small-to-moderate in the negative direction). Alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0) is above the sample mean but shows minimal correlation with CES-D in this cohort. Recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Daily leisure patterns include moderate media and music use; these show small correlations with CES-D and are not strong drivers of the overall risk profile.

Integration — factors pointing toward higher vs. lower depressive symptoms
Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), very long median sleep and very high night-to-night sleep variability (both highly elevated Z-scores), elevated perceived stress, and lower self-reported happiness. These features have non-trivial associations with CES-D in the sample and collectively suggest greater symptom burden related to sleep dysregulation and stress. Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms: above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction, frequent physical activity and sports participation, high levels of socializing, consolidated day–night patterns (low intradaily variability), low resting heart rate, and negligible recreational drug use. Several of these protective factors (self-esteem, exercise, social engagement) are associated with notably lower CES-D scores in the sample (self-esteem correlation r ≈ -0.71).

Holistic conclusion compared to the study sample
Considering the balance of risk and protective indicators, the participant’s profile is mixed. Sleep disturbance and large, irregular total sleep—both strong individual risk signals here—pull toward higher depressive symptom estimates, while robust social engagement, regular exercise, and above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction pull toward lower symptom estimates. On net, and given the relative magnitudes of the available z-scores and the direction and strength of sample correlations, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s depressive symptom level is near the population mean CES-D for the study sample, with a modest tendency toward being slightly above the mean. In other words: near the mean (perhaps mildly elevated), rather than clearly below or markedly above it. This interpretation is probabilistic and would be strengthened or revised by the participant’s actual CES-D score and longitudinal symptom data."
58793,"Evidence indicating relatively higher depressive symptoms: Several stable self-report traits in this profile are strongly associated with elevated CES-D scores in the study sample and therefore point toward greater depressive symptom risk. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 46; z = 0.46) is moderately elevated and the STAI–CES-D correlation in the sample is large (r = 0.82), indicating that this anxiety level is a robust predictor of higher depressive symptoms. Low self‑esteem (RSES = 33; z = -0.73) also aligns with a strong negative correlation with CES‑D (r = -0.71), and thus provides additional, substantial evidence favoring higher depressive symptomatology. Subjective affect is lower than average (self‑reported “Happy” = 3.0; z = -0.53; correlation with CES‑D r = -0.46), which further supports elevated symptom risk. There are smaller signals from physiology and sleep that could be consistent with risk: modestly higher MESOR (mean heart rate) and a slightly elevated intradaily variability (IV; z = 0.46) have small positive/uncertain associations with CES‑D in the sample, and variability in sleep start time (sleep‑start SD z = 0.46; correlation with CES‑D r ≈ 0.22) is weakly associated with greater depressive symptoms. Taken together, the strongest and most predictive elements indicating higher CES‑D are the elevated trait anxiety and the lower self‑esteem, supported by lower momentary happiness.

Evidence indicating relatively lower depressive symptoms: Multiple behavioral and subjective indicators provide countervailing evidence for lower depressive symptoms. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5; z = -0.8) and wearable-derived nocturnal heart‑rate dips are pronounced (large negative deviations overnight and a sizable circadian amplitude, amplitude z = 1.0), both consistent with intact sleep physiology and daily rhythm strength—factors typically protective against elevated depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is relatively high (6/7; z = 1.3; r with CES‑D ≈ -0.39), and the participant reports frequent social activity (socializing 3–4 hours; z = 1.74) and regular exercise both alone and with others (exercise z ≈ 1.1–1.2), each of which are common behavioral correlates of lower depressive symptom scores in the sample (although the direct correlations in this dataset are modest). Wearable circadian regularity metrics further support behavioral regularity: autocorrelation at 24h is relatively high (z = 1.06) and amplitude is large, indicating a robust daily heart‑rate rhythm that tends to be associated with better mood regulation. Alcohol and recreational drug use are low, and academic performance (GPA) is high, which are additional contextual markers typically not indicative of severe depressive symptomatology in this cohort.

Integration of wearable physiology and sleep: Wearable heart‑rate and sleep measures give a largely coherent picture of a person with strong circadian organization and generally sufficient sleep quantity. The median nightly sleep duration is long relative to the sample (median 9 h 2 min; z = 2.3), and nocturnal heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced overnight trough and large daytime peaks (notably an unusually large morning peak 8–9am; z = 3.52). A long sleep duration can sometimes be observed with depressive symptoms (hypersomnia), but in this dataset sleep duration has essentially no association with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.0), whereas sleep quality (PSQI) and circadian robustness (autocorrelation and amplitude) show small protective relationships. Overall the wearable data suggest a regular daily rhythm and adequate sleep opportunity, with only modest indications (sleep‑start variability, some intraday fragmentation) that might weakly relate to higher CES‑D.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean: Weighing the evidence, the strongest single predictors in this profile (trait anxiety and low self‑esteem) favor a higher CES‑D score, while several behavioral and physiological factors (good subjective sleep, frequent socializing and exercise, high health satisfaction, and robust circadian rhythm metrics) are protective. Because the largest statistical associations in the sample are those linking STAI and RSES to CES‑D, and these both indicate elevated risk here, the overall inferred depressive symptom level is most consistent with being slightly above the study population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.32). This inference is probabilistic and moderate in strength: it does not suggest extreme elevation, and protective behaviors/physiology present in the profile plausibly mitigate symptom severity. Limitations: this is an integrated, correlational inference using cross‑sectional trait and aggregated wearable metrics; it does not replace direct CES‑D measurement and is sensitive to the relative magnitudes of correlations in the reference sample."
96689,"Summary of indicators associated with higher depressive symptoms
Several features of the participant’s profile are consistent with factors that, in this sample, are associated with higher CES-D scores. Trait anxiety (STAI = 47; Z = 0.56) is elevated and has a very strong positive association with CES-D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.82), which makes it a particularly salient risk-related indicator. Subjective sleep quality meets the common threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), and the participant reports lower momentary happiness (Current happy = 3.0; Z = -0.53). Health satisfaction is low (2.11; Z = -1.61) and is negatively correlated with mood (sample r ≈ -0.40), which also points toward greater symptom burden. Behavioral factors that can co-occur with depressive symptomatology—minimal exercise (no reported exercise; Zs around -1.6 to -1.9) and relatively late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:55 AM)—also appear in the profile. A number of wearable-derived metrics (e.g., modestly elevated mesor and some hours with elevated heart-rate deviation) show small positive correlations with CES-D, but these relationships are of modest magnitude.

Summary of indicators associated with lower depressive symptoms
There are several countervailing signs that tend to predict lower depressive symptoms in this participant. Self-esteem is very high (Rosenberg = 39; Z = 0.11) and, in this sample, self‑esteem is strongly and negatively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), making it a potent protective factor. Objective sleep quantity and regularity as measured by the wearable are generally favorable: median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 18 min (Z = 0.14), low night-to-night sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 38 min; Z = -1.42), low variability in sleep start time (SD ≈ 29 min; Z = -1.19), and no daytime napping. These objective markers of sufficient, consistent sleep are typically associated with fewer depressive symptoms in the literature and in the study correlations (which are small to near zero for these particular metrics). The heart-rate–derived circadian profile shows a relatively large amplitude (amplitude Z = 1.36) and elevated interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Zs ≈ 0.75–0.98), indicating a robust and regular day–night physiological rhythm—features that are generally associated with more adaptive mood regulation and lower depression risk. The participant also reports moderate-to-high social time (socializing 2–3 hours; Z = 0.95) and minimal substance use, both of which are plausibly protective.

Wearable physiological patterns and behavioral timing (balanced interpretation)
Physiological data show a coherent circadian rhythm with a late-afternoon acrophase (≈ 5:14 PM), high amplitude, and above-average interdaily stability; these features together indicate a strong, stable daily rhythm that tends to be protective against depressive symptomatology. The participant’s resting heart rate (≈ 58.8 bpm) is in a typical range and does not suggest elevated baseline autonomic arousal. The hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate and relatively pronounced elevations in the evening hours (notably ~6–9 PM with Zs > 1), which may reflect concentrated evening activity or arousal. Intradaily variability is above average (Z ≈ 0.74), which signals more fragmentation in hourly activity/physiological switching within days; however, in this dataset intradaily variability has only a small negative association with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.05), so its contribution to depressive symptoms is uncertain and likely minor relative to the stronger psychological measures.

Holistic integration and comparison to sample CES‑D distribution
Weighing the available evidence, the profile contains both strong protective (notably very high self‑esteem, sufficient and regular objective sleep, stable circadian rhythm, social engagement, minimal substance use) and risk-related (notably elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, low health satisfaction, very low exercise) elements. The strongest single statistical contributors in this dataset are trait anxiety (strong positive correlation with CES‑D) and self‑esteem (strong negative correlation). Given these countervailing influences, the most defensible summary is that this participant’s overall depressive symptom level is near the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.33). The pattern of indicators does not strongly suggest extreme elevation well above the sample mean, nor does it point to substantially lower-than-average depressive symptoms; if anything, the elevated anxiety and low health satisfaction make a small shift toward higher-than-mean symptoms plausible, but this would likely remain within one sample standard deviation rather than representing an outlying high score.

Caveats
These inferences combine cross-sectional associations, subjective report, and aggregated wearable metrics; correlations reported in the dataset are associative and do not imply causation. The CES‑D score for this individual was not provided directly; the above interpretation is an evidence-weighted inference using available predictors and their sample correlations. Individual diagnosis or clinical conclusions should not be drawn solely from these data without direct clinical assessment."
33657,"Summary — overall pattern:
The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of behavioral risk markers for depressive symptoms alongside several relatively strong protective signals. Self-report measures show comparatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = −0.43) and relatively high self‑esteem (RSES scaled score shown as 41, Z = 0.40) and positive affect (self‑reported “Happy” = 4.0, Z = 0.55). Objective wearable measures show a typical nightly sleep duration near the sample median (median 7 h 5 min, Z = −0.13) and a low resting heart rate (51.2 bpm, Z = −0.83). At the same time, subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 6), circadian structure shows some fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.65, Z = 0.74) and sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:42). Taking the evidence together, the balance of strong protective self‑report measures and physiological indicators suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.3), while several behavioral patterns warrant attention as potential contributors to elevated symptoms if they persist or worsen.

Features pointing toward relatively higher CES‑D:
Several behavioral and circadian markers are associated with small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample and are elevated for this participant. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) is above common cutoffs for clinically meaningful sleep complaints and is a known correlate of depressive symptoms. The participant shows late sleep timing (median start ≈ 1:42 AM) and substantial day‑to‑day napping (mean daily naps = 0.26, Z = 2.23), and napping in this sample correlates positively with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.21), suggesting a possible compensatory pattern or disrupted nocturnal sleep consolidation linked to higher symptomatology. Daytime behavioral indicators include very high time spent in a sedentary hobby (Z = 3.19), and elevated internet usage (2–3 hours, Z = 0.85); both of these have small positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample. Wearable circadian metrics show reduced interdaily regularity (interdaily stability = 0.35, Z = −0.49) and elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74), indicating more fragmented circadian structure — fragmentation that, in general, is often associated with poorer mood and concentration.

Features pointing toward relatively lower CES‑D:
Several robust protective indicators favor a lower depressive‑symptom estimate. Trait anxiety is below the sample mean (STAI Z = −0.43) even though STAI and CES‑D are strongly correlated in the sample (r ≈ 0.81); this low anxiety score therefore strongly weighs toward fewer depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem is above average (RSES Z = 0.40) and shows a relatively large negative correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.71), again favoring lower depression scores. Current happiness and health satisfaction are also above average (Happy Z = 0.55; Health Satisfaction Z = 0.22), and perceived stress is not elevated (PSS Z = −0.44). Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is in a healthy range (≈7 h) and resting heart rate and mesor are on the lower side of the sample distribution (RHR Z ≈ −0.83; mesor Z ≈ −1.46), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness or lower physiological arousal; in this sample higher heart rate measures show small positive correlations with CES‑D, so the participant’s lower values are protective.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study mean:
When the relative magnitudes and sample correlations are considered, the strongest single pieces of evidence point toward lower depressive symptoms for this participant: low trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES‑D) and relatively high self‑esteem (strong inverse correlate) are influential findings. Several objective risk markers (fragmented circadian pattern, late sleep timing, increased napping, and very high sedentary hobby time) raise concern and are consistent with behavioral profiles that accompany higher depressive scores, but their sample correlations with CES‑D are smaller than those for STAI and self‑esteem. Therefore the overall balance of evidence indicates that the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D score of 13.3 (i.e., “below the population mean”), rather than near or above it, although not uniformly low across all behavioral domains.

Uncertainty and monitoring notes:
This inference carries uncertainty because some risk markers (poor subjective sleep quality, circadian fragmentation, late sleep schedules, frequent napping, and extreme sedentary pastime) can worsen mood over time or interact with stressors; their presence suggests monitoring of sleep timing and daytime activity would be useful. The sample correlations reported here are modest for many wearable metrics, so the strongest bases for the below‑mean inference are the participant’s low trait anxiety and relatively high self‑esteem and positive affect."
36117,"Overview: The multimodal profile shows a mixture of behavioral, self-report, and physiological signals that, taken together, point toward relatively low current depressive symptomatology with specific areas of concern. Several self-report indices that are strongly inversely associated with CES-D (notably self-esteem and momentary happiness) are elevated for this participant, and objective circadian/behavioral measures indicate a well-organized daily pattern. Conversely, subjective sleep disturbance, late and variable sleep timing, elevated resting heart rate and mesor, and high sedentary and online activity are available signals that modestly favor higher depressive symptoms. Below I summarize the most salient protective and risk-relevant features and then integrate them into an overall comparative judgment relative to the study sample mean CES-D (mean = 13.3).

Features consistent with lower depressive symptoms (protective signals)
- Positive self-report indicators: The participant’s self-esteem and current happiness scores are well above the sample mean (self-esteem Z ≈ +0.96; happiness Z ≈ +1.64), and these measures have moderately large negative correlations with CES-D in the study (self-esteem r ≈ -0.71; happiness r ≈ -0.46). This pattern is one of the strongest protective signals in the dataset. Trait anxiety is low (STAI Z ≈ -0.33), which also reduces risk for higher depressive symptoms.
- Social and activity engagement: The participant reports frequent socializing (more than four hours; Z ≈ +2.53) and regular exercise with others (three times per week or more; Z ≈ +1.23). Where present, greater social interaction and group exercise are associated in the sample with lower depressive symptoms (exercise-with-others correlation r ≈ -0.23).
- Regular circadian structure: Wearable-derived circadian metrics show relatively high interdaily stability (Z ≈ +1.16), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -1.94), and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ +1.23). These indicate a consistent, regular daily rhythm in heart-rate behavior across days—an objective pattern that is generally protective or at least indicative of behavioral regularity that tends to co-occur with lower CES-D scores.
- Adequate sleep quantity and low napping: Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 h 39 min (Z ≈ +0.58), and mean daily naps are essentially zero (Z ≈ -0.86). Sufficient aggregate sleep duration and low daytime napping are consistent with lower depressive symptom burden in many samples.

Features consistent with higher depressive symptoms (risk signals)
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing variability: The participant’s PSQI score is elevated (score 8, Z ≈ +0.59) indicating disturbed subjective sleep quality. Sleep start time is late (median ≈ 01:13) and sleep-onset timing shows substantial variability (SD ≈ 100 minutes, Z ≈ +0.37). Late and irregular sleep timing and poor subjective sleep quality are known correlates of higher depressive symptoms and may counterbalance the objectively adequate sleep duration.
- Physiological arousal markers: Resting heart rate and MESOR are higher than the sample mean (resting HR Z ≈ +1.65, MESOR Z ≈ +2.04); both show modest positive correlations with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ +0.19). Elevated baseline cardiac tone can index somatic arousal or physiological stress and thus contribute modestly to higher depressive symptom scores.
- Sedentary and high-screen behaviors: The participant reports extensive sedentary hobby time (Z ≈ +3.19) and heavy internet use (Z ≈ +2.19). In this sample these behaviors have small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES-D (internet usage r ≈ +0.25; sedentary hobby r ≈ +0.12), so they are noteworthy risk-related behaviors.
- Mixed objective activity amplitude and timing: Heart-rate amplitude is relatively high (Z ≈ +1.58), and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon/evening (~5:06 PM). While amplitude and timing are not unidirectionally predictive, the combination of elevated mesor/resting HR with late sleep timing suggests a partial mismatch between physiological arousal and preferred sleep schedule for this individual.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to study mean CES-D
Weighing these factors, the strongest and most predictive signals in this dataset favor lower depressive symptoms: notably high self-esteem and current happiness (strong negative correlates), low trait anxiety, frequent social engagement, and a regular circadian pattern. Countervailing evidence (subjective poor sleep quality, late and variable sleep timing, elevated resting HR/MESOR, and extensive sedentary/online time) are meaningful but generally exert smaller associations with CES-D in the study or are of more modest statistical magnitude. Therefore, the overall pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean (13.3). In other words, this participant’s profile is more characteristic of lower-than-average CES-D scores in this sample, although some risk-related features warrant attention.

Caveats and uncertainty
This inference is probabilistic and based on correlational associations and group-level z-scores rather than a direct CES-D self-report value for this individual. Some objective markers (e.g., higher resting HR, sleep timing variability) could reflect situational stress, illness, or fitness differences rather than mood per se. Additionally, some protective and risk signals coexist (e.g., adequate sleep duration but poor subjective sleep quality), which increases uncertainty. For applied interpretation or clinical decisions, direct CES-D assessment and follow-up on subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning would reduce uncertainty and clarify whether the risk features are transient or persistent."
92515,"Summary statement
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant shows a mixed profile with stronger evidence for relatively low depressive symptom burden than for high burden. Prominent protective indicators include relatively high self-reported positive affect and self-esteem, low trait anxiety and perceived stress, and preserved, coherent circadian variation in heart rate. Clear risk-relevant findings are limited largely to short and late sleep (both objectively measured and subjectively reported disturbed sleep) and modestly reduced health satisfaction. On balance, when these multimodal signals are integrated the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean CES-D (population mean = 13.33), albeit with sleep-related features that warrant attention.

Features that plausibly indicate relatively lower CES‑D (protective)
- Positive affect and self-regard: The participant’s current happiness rating (5.0; Z = 1.64) and self-esteem score (reported as 41; Z = 0.40) are both above the sample mean and, given their moderate-to-strong negative correlations with CES‑D in the dataset (happiness r ≈ -0.46; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71), these responses provide substantive evidence consistent with lower depressive symptoms.  
- Low trait anxiety and perceived stress: The STAI–Trait score of 36 (Z = -0.52; classified as “not anxious”) and a Perceived Stress Scale score of 19 (Z = -0.71) indicate lower chronic anxiety-proneness and lower perceived stress relative to peers; both constructs are positively correlated with CES‑D in the sample, so lower values here point away from higher depressive symptoms.  
- Preserved circadian structure and autonomic resting tone: Heart-rate circadian metrics show modest interdaily stability (0.42, Z = 0.09) and a relatively high autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 0.73), with a clear daytime acrophase at 4:43 PM and an objectively low resting heart rate (56 bpm, Z = -0.26). These findings indicate a recognizable day–night rhythm and generally lower resting autonomic arousal—patterns that are not typical of severe depressive dysregulation and therefore are consistent with lower CES‑D.

Features that plausibly indicate relatively higher CES‑D (risk-relevant)
- Short and late sleep: Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration is 5 hours 55 minutes (Z = -1.58), and the median sleep start time is very late (approximately 02:57). The PSQI score of 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”) corroborates subjective sleep disturbance. Poor and late sleep are commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms in the literature and in this dataset (sleep variability measures also show modest positive correlations with CES‑D), so these sleep characteristics represent the most salient risk signal in the record.  
- Lower health satisfaction and some variability in sleep timing: Health satisfaction is below the sample mean (score 3.22, Z = -0.78); in the study this construct correlates negatively with CES‑D, so lower satisfaction is consistent with greater depressive symptoms. The participant also shows moderate sleep start time variability (SD ≈ 110 minutes, Z = 0.59), and this irregularity has a small positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.22).  
- Modest reductions in circadian amplitude: Cosinor amplitude is slightly below the sample mean (amplitude 9.67, Z = -0.36). Lower amplitude of the circadian rhythm has been linked to depressive symptoms in some work and the correlation in this dataset is slightly negative, so this finding is a minor risk-relevant indicator.

Physiological and behavioral integration
Wearable heart-rate hourly deviations show a large nocturnal drop and a clear daytime increase with peak activity in the early-to-mid afternoon (positive deviations 12–15:00 and acrophase at ~4:43 PM), indicating preserved day–night cardiovascular regulation rather than blunted or chaotic rhythms. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (Z = 0.73), and measures of intradaily variability and interdaily stability are near the study mean, further supporting a stable 24‑hour rhythm. This preserved physiological rhythm mitigates some concern raised by short sleep duration, suggesting the participant’s circadian system is functioning with recognizable regularity even though the sleep episode is delayed and relatively short.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Taking the full multimodal profile into account, the preponderance of evidence supports an inference of depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean CES‑D score (i.e., “below the population mean”). Strong protective signals—relatively high self-reported happiness and self-esteem, low trait anxiety and perceived stress, and preserved circadian heart-rate structure—outweigh the primary risk domain of short, late, and subjectively disturbed sleep plus modestly reduced health satisfaction. That said, the magnitude of the sleep deficit (median < 6 hours nightly) and late timing are clinically meaningful and represent the most important domain for follow-up: improving sleep duration/regularity could further reduce risk and improve well-being. Finally, this inference is probabilistic and indirect (the participant’s actual CES‑D score was not provided); if an explicit CES‑D measurement is needed to confirm current depressive symptoms, direct assessment is recommended."
49790,"Summary
The multimodal profile shows a mixture of clear protective features (notably low trait anxiety and high self-esteem) together with behavioral and physiological indicators that would be expected to increase risk for elevated depressive symptoms (notably disturbed sleep timing, circadian irregularity, and an elevated resting heart rate). Several of the strongest statistical departures from the study population are: low STAI–Trait (score = 27, Z = -1.41), high self-esteem (RSES, Z = 1.10), elevated resting heart rate (75.7 bpm, Z = 2.09) and elevated mesor from cosinor analysis (88.8, Z = 2.03), and markedly variable/late sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:18, sleep start SD Z = 1.89). Correlations reported in the dataset indicate that STAI and self-esteem are among the survey measures most strongly linked to CES-D in this sample (STAI correlation 0.81; self-esteem correlation -0.71), while many wearable circadian metrics have smaller correlations with CES-D in this cohort.

Features associated with higher depressive symptoms
Several data elements suggest elevated depressive symptom risk. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is in the “disturbed sleep” range (PSQI = 7), which commonly relates to worse mood. Sleep timing is late and irregular (median sleep onset ≈ 02:18; sleep start SD Z = 1.89), and objective circadian-regularity indices are reduced (interdaily stability = 0.25, Z = -1.32; autocorrelation at 24h Z = -1.54), consistent with an irregular daily schedule — a pattern that is often associated with higher depressive symptoms or poorer mood regulation. Resting heart rate and the mesor are both notably elevated (resting HR Z = 2.09; mesor Z = 2.03), which in this sample show a small positive relationship with CES-D (correlations ≈ 0.2). Subjective indicators that modestly point toward risk include somewhat elevated perceived stress (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) and lower momentary happiness (current happiness Z = -0.53). Lower-than-average frequency of some social or recreational activities (socializing Z = -0.62; sports Z = -1.09) and only modest exercise frequency (1–2 times/week) are additional behavioral features that can be associated with greater depressive symptoms in some contexts.

Features associated with lower depressive symptoms
Several robust protective signals appear in the self-report data. Trait anxiety is well below the study mean (STAI Z = -1.41), and trait anxiety in this sample is strongly positively correlated with CES-D (r = 0.81), so this is a substantial protective indicator. Self-esteem is higher than average (RSES Z = 1.10) and strongly inversely related to CES-D in the cohort (r = -0.71), another substantial protective factor. The participant reports relatively high satisfaction with their physical health (health satisfaction Z = 1.22) and relatively high interpersonal trust (trust Z = 1.47), both correlating with lower CES-D in the sample. Objective total sleep duration is relatively long (median ≈ 8 h 4 min, Z = 1.10), and the participant reports no daytime naps (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86), which are neutral-to-protective for mood in many studies. Substance use is low overall, and academic performance appears strong (GPA values in the mid-high range), both of which are not indicative of elevated depressive symptoms here.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample
Balancing these sources of information, the participant presents a mixed but overall not strongly elevated risk profile for depressive symptoms. The most powerful individual predictors available in the dataset (low trait anxiety and high self-esteem) point toward lower CES-D scores, while several objective behavioral and physiological signals (disturbed subjective sleep, late and variable sleep timing, reduced circadian regularity, and elevated resting heart rate) point toward increased symptom risk. Given the relative magnitudes of those effects in this sample — especially the strong protective associations of low STAI and high self-esteem — the overall pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms near to or slightly below the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.34). In other words, the data do not strongly indicate a CES-D markedly above the sample mean; if anything, they are more consistent with CES-D values at or modestly lower than the population mean, while acknowledging several behavioral/physiological features that could warrant monitoring or targeted intervention.

Implications for monitoring and follow-up
Because objective circadian irregularity (late, variable sleep timing; low interdaily stability) and an elevated resting heart rate are relatively prominent here despite protective psychological traits, continued monitoring of sleep timing, sleep quality, and physiological arousal is advisable. If subjective sleep disturbance or daytime functioning worsens, or if perceived stress rises, these changes could shift risk upward given the current mixture of signals. Interventions focused on stabilizing sleep–wake timing and reducing physiological arousal (for example, consistent sleep schedules, sleep hygiene, or stress-reduction techniques) would address the behavioral/physiological risk factors identified, complementing the participant’s existing psychological strengths."
78657,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of protective psychosocial features and sleep/circadian characteristics that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms. On balance, however, the strongest and most consistent signals in the dataset (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low perceived stress, regular exercise and social time, healthy BMI, and relatively high interpersonal trust) point toward a level of depressive symptoms that is below the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31). The remainder of this report outlines the specific features that pull in opposite directions and clarifies how wearable-derived physiology and sleep patterns modulate the overall interpretation.

Features that tend to indicate relatively lower depressive symptoms: Several survey measures that correlate substantially with CES‑D favor a lower score for this participant. Trait anxiety (STAI) is not elevated (score = 38, Z = -0.33) despite a strong positive study‑level correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81), which is an important protective sign. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39, Z = 0.11) and its study‑level correlation with CES‑D is strongly negative (r = -0.71), which also predicts fewer depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is relatively low (PSS = 17, Z = -1.26), and health satisfaction and BMI are in healthy ranges (health satisfaction Z = -1.53; BMI 21.9), further supporting resilience. Behavioral habits that are generally protective — exercising three times per week or more (alone and with others, Z ≈ 1.1–1.2), regular socializing with friends (≈2–3 hours, Z = 0.95), and negligible napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86) — also point toward lower CES‑D relative to the sample.

Features that tend to indicate relatively higher depressive symptoms: Subjective and objective sleep characteristics provide the clearest signals in the direction of elevated symptoms. The participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI (score = 7, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), and wearable data show relatively short median nightly sleep (6 h 30 min, Z = -0.85), a very late median sleep start time (03:38), and high night‑to‑night variability in sleep onset (sleep start SD ≈ 123 minutes, Z = 0.88). Late and unstable sleep timing and subjective poor sleep are commonly associated with worse mood and can contribute to higher CES‑D scores; the dataset also shows elevated sleep duration variability (SD = 117 minutes, Z = 0.36). The participant’s self-reported current happiness is lower than the sample average (current happiness = 3.0, Z = -0.53), and happy scores correlate negatively with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ -0.46), which supports a potential increase in depressive symptoms relative to otherwise protective traits. Evening physiological activation is also notable in the wearable HR deviations (large positive deviations in the 7–9 pm range, e.g., 7–8 pm deviation = 20.28, Z = 1.53), consistent with ongoing arousal late in the day that may relate to delayed sleep timing.

Circadian and physiological synthesis: Heart‑rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a rhythm that is present but somewhat attenuated and irregular. MESOR and resting heart rate are below the sample mean (MESOR = 68.8, Z = -0.7; resting HR = 53.4, Z = -0.56), amplitude is near average (Z = -0.02), and acrophase is in the evening (≈6:50 pm). Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.31, Z = -0.82) and intradaily variability is moderately elevated (0.67, Z = 0.88), while 24‑hour autocorrelation is low (0.25, Z = -0.61). Together these features describe a circadian rhythm that is less regular and more fragmented than the average participant, with pronounced evening heart‑rate deviations and a late sleep schedule. While many of these circadian features in this particular dataset have weak direct correlations with CES‑D, the pattern of irregular timing and late sleep is clinically and empirically relevant because it can exacerbate mood symptoms and reduce sleep quality over time.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample mean: Weighing the evidence across modalities, the strongest predictors in this dataset (low STAI, high self‑esteem, low perceived stress, regular exercise and social engagement) argue for fewer depressive symptoms than the study average, while disturbed subjective sleep, late and variable sleep timing, lower current happiness, and circadian irregularity pull in the opposite direction. Integrating these factors, the participant’s overall profile is more consistent with a CES‑D level below the study population mean (13.31), though not uniformly low across domains. In other words, the participant appears to have several psychosocial protective factors that likely keep overall depressive symptoms below the sample mean, but sleep timing irregularity and reduced momentary happiness represent important targets that could elevate symptom burden if they worsen. This interpretation should be understood as probabilistic and relative to the sample distribution; targeted assessment of mood and sleep (including a direct CES‑D score if available) and monitoring of sleep timing would help refine the estimate and identify any need for intervention."
48154,"Protective indicators (features associated with lower depressive symptoms): Several strong self-report signals point toward relatively low depressive symptomatology. The participant reports high self-esteem (RSES z = +1.66; the RSES → CES-D correlation r ≈ -0.71 is one of the largest sample associations), and elevated momentary happiness (z = +1.64, r ≈ -0.46). Trait anxiety is low (STAI z = -1.12), and overall perceived sleep quality is good (PSQI score = 5; z = -0.8). Behavioral health markers that typically protect against depression are present: regular solitary exercise at least three times per week (exercise z = +1.07), generally high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction z ≈ +0.47), a normative BMI (23.2), and objectively long and stable sleep (median sleep duration ≈ 8 h 3 min, z = +1.08; low night-to-night variability). Resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, z = -0.26), and several cardiovascular features (e.g., lower mesor, evening activity peaks consistent with active daytime/evening engagement) are consistent with adequate physiological recovery. Taken together, these features — and particularly the large negative correlation of self‑esteem with CES‑D in the sample — weigh strongly toward lower CES‑D scores than the study mean.

Risk indicators (features associated with higher depressive symptoms): A handful of measures point in the opposite direction. Circadian regularity metrics indicate reduced day‑to‑day stability (interdaily stability = 0.26; z = -1.23) and modest intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ +0.1), which in prior work is associated with elevated depressive symptoms and poorer mood regulation. The participant’s typical sleep start time is late (median start ≈ 01:03), which can relate to circadian misalignment even when total sleep time is ample. Some lifestyle indicators have small positive associations with CES‑D in the sample: recreational drug use frequency shows a relatively high z (1.61) and a small positive correlation with CES‑D, and internet usage (2–3 hours/day) has a modest positive correlation (r ≈ 0.26). Perceived stress is not minimal (PSS = 21) and correlates positively with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.28), suggesting some stress-related risk. Finally, reduced interpersonal exercise/social exercise (exercising with others z ≈ -0.88) may reflect lower social engagement in domains that buffer mood. These risk indicators are present but, based on the magnitudes and sample correlations provided, generally weaker predictors than the strongest protective markers.

Physiological circadian and heart‑rate summary: Heart‑rate–based circadian metrics show a relatively low amplitude and lower mesor (amplitude z ≈ -0.71; mesor z ≈ -0.78) and a clear nocturnal decrease with expected daytime/evening elevations (largest aggregate positive deviation around 5–6 pm). The acrophase (≈ 5:29 PM) and an early‑evening peak in aggregated deviation suggest typical daytime activation rather than blunted diurnal variation. The most notable wearable-derived concern is the low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.23), indicating less consistent 24‑hour structure across days; however, most of these heart‑rate features have small sample correlations with CES‑D (many near zero), so while circadian irregularity is a potentially relevant signal, its direct association with CES‑D in this dataset appears modest.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the participant displays multiple relatively large, protective indicators (high self‑esteem, high momentary happiness, regular exercise, good subjective and objective sleep duration, and low anxiety) and only a few weaker risk indicators (reduced interdaily stability, late sleep timing, modest stress, and modest substance/internet use). Because the strongest predictors in the data (notably self‑esteem and self‑reported happiness) are associated with substantially lower CES‑D scores in the sample, the overall pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean CES‑D score of 13.34. This characterization is probabilistic and relative: it indicates a lower-than-average symptom burden in this sample context rather than the absence of any risk. Limitations include the absence of a direct CES‑D score for this participant in the provided data and the fact that several wearable circadian metrics, while suggestive, have small sample correlations with CES‑D; therefore circadian irregularity and late sleep timing should be followed as potential, but not determinative, risk factors."
21793,"Summary of data supporting relatively elevated depressive symptoms
Multiple self-report and wearable-derived indicators converge toward patterns that are commonly associated with higher CES‑D scores. On self-report the participant endorses elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) and high perceived stress (PSS = 27, Z = 1.47); the STAI scale in this dataset shows a very strong positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81), making this a salient risk signal. Subjective sleep is disturbed (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05) and current self‑reported happiness is below the sample mean (Happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53), both of which typically co‑occur with higher depressive symptoms. Wearable sleep measures show objectively short and irregular nocturnal sleep (median sleep 6 h 9 min, Z = -1.29) with a very late and variable sleep onset (median sleep start ≈ 03:36, sleep‑start SD Z = 1.04) and an unusually high rate of daily naps (mean naps 0.33/day, Z = 3.05). Circadian rhythm metrics from heart rate further indicate weak, fragmented daily structure: low interdaily stability (0.17, Z = -1.98), reduced amplitude (6.5, Z = -1.38), low mesor (65.7, Z = -1.13) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.15, Z = -1.45). This combination of disturbed subjective sleep, objectively short and delayed sleep timing, frequent napping, and attenuated/irregular circadian heart‑rate rhythms is consistent with physiological and behavioral profiles that tend to accompany higher depressive symptomatology.

Evidence that attenuates a high‑symptom interpretation
There are several features in the record that mitigate a straightforward conclusion of elevated depressive symptoms. Self‑esteem is close to the study mean (Rosenberg score = 37, Z = -0.17) rather than markedly low; social contact is present at roughly average levels (socializing 1–2 hours, Z = 0.16); substance use is minimal; and the participant reports moderate health satisfaction (4.67 on a 1–7 scale, Z = 0.30). Wearable resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm, Z = -0.47), which can reflect better cardiorespiratory fitness and is not in itself an indicator of depression. Several objective circadian correlations with CES‑D in this dataset are small or near zero (e.g., interdaily stability correlation ≈ 0.0, amplitude correlation ≈ -0.10), indicating that not every circadian metric here has a strong, direct association with CES‑D in the study sample. These features suggest some behavioral and physiological resilience and argue against assuming extreme depressive symptom severity on the basis of any single indicator.

Integrated interpretation and likely position relative to the study population
Weighing the pattern of evidence, the balance favors an interpretation of depressive symptoms that is above the study population mean. The strongest single signal is elevated trait anxiety (STAI) which has a large positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample; this, together with high perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), objectively short and highly delayed sleep timing, frequent napping (Z = 3.05), and markedly reduced circadian stability (interdaily stability Z = -1.98) all point toward a profile associated with greater depressive symptom burden. Taken together, these indicators make it likely that this participant’s CES‑D score would be above the population mean of 13.3 rather than near or below it. At the same time, the presence of near‑average self‑esteem, some social activity, low substance use, and moderate health satisfaction suggest the elevation is not unambiguously extreme and may be of moderate severity rather than severe.

Limitations and recommended follow‑up
These inferences are probabilistic and associative: correlations do not establish causation, the heart‑rate circadian values are aggregated across days and cannot resolve day‑to‑day temporal trajectories, and the dataset lacks an explicit participant CES‑D numeric value for direct comparison. Given the constellation of high trait anxiety, high perceived stress, disturbed subjective and objective sleep timing, and circadian irregularity—factors that together commonly co‑occur with increased depressive symptoms—targeted follow‑up (e.g., administration of the CES‑D if not already collected, clinical interview, or sleep/circadian assessment and interventions) would clarify current symptom level and functional impact."
37218,"Summary of risk-related indicators
Several self-report and wearable-derived features point toward elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 49, Z = +0.76) and this measure has a strong positive association with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the more weighty indicators for higher depressive symptomatology. Low global self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 29, Z = −1.29; r with CES‑D = −0.71) is also strongly associated with higher CES‑D in the cohort and therefore increases the likelihood of above‑average depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = +1.52, classified as disturbed sleep); poor PSQI scores commonly co‑occur with higher depressive symptoms and thus add risk. The participant’s current self‑reported happiness is low (2.0, Z = −1.61; r = −0.46), which aligns with increased depressive symptom scores in the sample. Behavioral markers that commonly co‑occur with depression are also present: short median nightly sleep duration (6 h 1 min; Z = −1.45) and a very late median sleep start time (≈ 03:56), both of which are often linked to elevated depressive symptoms or affective disturbance. Finally, reduced amplitude of the heart‑rate circadian rhythm (Amplitude = 8.83, Z = −0.63) — a flattening of daily physiological variation — is consistent with patterns reported in individuals with higher depressive symptoms and therefore provides additional support for an elevated CES‑D inference.

Summary of protective / lower-risk indicators
There are several features that counterbalance the risk indicators and suggest relatively lower depressive symptom burden. Reported perceived stress is lower than the study mean (PSS = 14, Z = −2.07), and although perceived stress correlates positively with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.29), this low score is protective relative to peers. The participant reports substantial social time (socializing with friends = 3–4 hours per day, Z = +1.74), and frequent social engagement is generally associated with lower depressive symptoms; in this dataset socializing has a near‑zero correlation with CES‑D but, behaviorally, time spent with others is typically protective. Substance use is minimal (no alcohol, no recreational/non‑prescribed drugs; Zs all negative), which reduces risk relative to peers. Objective circadian regularity metrics are not strongly disrupted: interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.48, Z = +0.58) and intradaily variability is near the sample mean (0.55, Z = +0.03), suggesting a relatively regular day‑to‑day heart‑rate rhythm and routine that can be protective. Academic performance (recent GPA 3.76) and absence of daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = −0.86) are additional factors that are typically associated with lower functional impairment and lower depressive symptom burden.

Interpretation of wearable physiology and sleep timing
Wearable heart‑rate features indicate a modestly elevated mesor (76.13 bpm, Z = +0.30) and resting heart rate (61 bpm, Z = +0.34), but these are small deviations from the sample average. The circadian amplitude reduction (Z = −0.63) is notable because flattened amplitude of physiological rhythms is a replicable group‑level correlate of depressive symptoms; however, interdaily stability being above average suggests the participant still maintains a fairly consistent 24‑hour schedule. Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show expected nocturnal declines and daytime peaks, with no dramatic breaks in the day‑night pattern; this supports the interpretation of preserved, though somewhat blunted, circadian organization. Objectively short median sleep (about 6 hours) combined with a very late habitual sleep onset (~03:56) describes a delayed and shortened sleep pattern — a combination that is commonly associated with worse mood and higher CES‑D scores, even when day‑to‑day sleep variability (SD of start time ≈ 74 minutes, Z ≈ −0.2) is not extreme.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Balancing the evidence yields a modestly elevated probability of higher depressive symptoms compared with the study sample mean. Strong predictors that favor an above‑mean CES‑D are elevated trait anxiety (strongly correlated with CES‑D), low self‑esteem (strong negative correlate), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 10), low self‑reported happiness, short sleep duration, and blunted circadian amplitude. Moderating evidence (lower perceived stress than peers, substantial social time, low substance use, relatively stable interdaily rhythms, good recent GPA) suggests that the participant is not at the extreme end of symptom severity and retains several functional resources. On net, the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the population mean (study mean CES‑D = 13.28). The data support a characterization of elevated depressive symptoms relative to peers rather than severe or incapacitating symptomatology, noting uncertainty because the participant’s actual CES‑D score is not provided here.

Limitations
Interpretation is limited by the absence of the participant’s direct CES‑D score in the provided data, reliance on cross‑sectional associations and Z‑scores relative to the sample, and potential self‑report biases. Wearable aggregation (hourly averages and summary circadian metrics) cannot capture day‑specific context or acute events that might affect mood. These caveats should be considered if using this profile for individual clinical decision‑making or intervention planning."
17932,"Summary and overall comparison to the study sample:
Taken together, the participant’s multimodal profile contains both clear protective features and a few prominent risk indicators for depressive symptoms. Balancing these data, the pattern is most consistent with an overall depressive-symptom level near the study population mean CES-D score (population mean = 13.31). Several strong protective signals (notably low trait anxiety and high self-esteem) are offset by a pronounced subjective sleep disturbance and some interpersonal/happiness-related signals that point toward elevated symptoms in specific domains; consequently the overall estimate is “near the mean” rather than clearly above or below it.

Factors in the data that are associated with relatively higher CES-D scores:
- Subjective sleep disturbance is a salient risk signal. The participant’s PSQI is 13 (Z = 2.9), a large positive deviation relative to the sample and indicative of clinically notable perceived sleep problems; subjective sleep difficulties commonly co-occur with higher depressive symptoms.  
- Lower self-reported current happiness (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and reduced interpersonal trust (trust Z = -1.1, correlation with CES-D ≈ -0.41) point to affective and social vulnerabilities that tend to track with higher depression scores.  
- Behavioral markers that may relate to mood risk include a late median sleep start time (about 01:23 AM) and elevated time spent in video games (Z = 2.47). Late sleep timing and greater solitary/recreational screen time can be associated with mood dysregulation in young adult samples.  
- Although several wearable circadian metrics are unremarkable, a few hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively reduced nocturnal physiological tone and later evening peaks; in some contexts, mismatches between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep timing can be associated with increased symptom reporting.

Factors in the data that are associated with relatively lower CES-D scores:
- Trait anxiety is below the sample mean (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) and the STAI–CES-D correlation in this dataset is strong and positive (r ≈ 0.81). The participant’s lower anxiety proneness therefore represents a robust protective factor against elevated depressive symptoms.  
- Self-esteem is above the sample mean (Rosenberg-like score, Z = 0.82) and this metric correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.71), again suggesting meaningful protection.  
- Several indicators of stable daily organization and physiological resilience are present: interdaily stability (Z = 1.08) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.65) are relatively high while intradaily variability is relatively low (Z = -1.24). These circadian regularity patterns typically align with fewer mood symptoms.  
- Objective sleep duration is longer than average (median 8 h 35 min, Z = 1.74) and resting heart rate is low (48.65 bpm, Z = -1.13), both of which can reflect good recovery/fitness and are not typically linked to higher CES-D in this sample. Regular exercise frequency (exercising alone three times/week or more, Z = 1.07) and reasonably high health satisfaction (Z ≈ 0.97) further indicate behavioral and subjective resource factors that correlate with lower depressive symptoms.

Integrated interpretation and implications:
The most striking discordance in this profile is the combination of objectively long, regular nocturnal sleep and circadian stability with a very high subjective sleep disturbance score (PSQI Z = 2.9). That dissociation—good objective sleep quantity/regularity but poor subjective sleep quality—often signals insomnia-type complaints, fragmented sleep experience, or sleep-related distress; such subjective sleep problems have a well-established relationship with elevated depressive symptoms. Counterbalancing that risk are strong, highly predictive protective markers: low trait anxiety and high self-esteem (both of which have large sample-level correlations with CES-D), plus regular activity rhythms and frequent exercise. Taken together, these features suggest the participant is not showing a uniformly elevated depressive profile but does report domain-specific difficulties—particularly poor perceived sleep and reduced happiness/trust—that could raise CES-D scores modestly compared with the healthiest individuals in the sample. Because of the strong protective indices, the overall inferred level is best described as near the study sample mean CES-D rather than clearly above it; targeted assessment of subjective sleep complaints and social/interpersonal functioning would be the most informative next steps for clarifying risk."
81420,"Summary and overall inference
Taken together, the multimodal profile contains a mix of clear risk indicators and some protective features. The strongest signals favoring greater depressive symptomatology are elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and relatively low self‑esteem (RSES = 31, Z = −1.01); these two measures also show the largest correlations with CES‑D in the study sample (STAI–CES‑D r = 0.81; Self‑esteem–CES‑D r = −0.71), which makes them the most informative behavioral predictors in this dataset. Several secondary indicators (subjective sleep disturbance on the PSQI, modestly elevated perceived stress, somewhat reduced circadian amplitude and stability metrics, and a slightly elevated resting heart rate/mesor) are consistent with additional risk. Offsetting features include normative objective sleep duration, frequent exercise, a self‑reported current happiness rating above the group mean, and routine socializing and low nap frequency. On balance—giving greater weight to the measures with the largest study correlations (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) and the participant’s disturbed sleep complaints—the pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.28).

Factors consistent with higher CES‑D scores (risk indicators)
- Strongly associated psychological traits: The participant’s STAI–Trait score is elevated (50, Z = 0.86) and, in this sample, trait anxiety has a very large positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81). Low self‑esteem (RSES = 31, Z = −1.01) is also a robust correlate of depressive symptoms in this cohort (r = −0.71). Because these two self‑report traits are both moderate-to-strongly deviant and tightly linked to CES‑D in this study, they are primary contributors to the inference of above‑mean depressive symptoms.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing: The participant’s PSQI score is 8 (Z = 0.59), classified as disturbed sleep. Although objective median nightly sleep duration is close to the sample mean (7 hr 12 min, Z = 0.02), the participant reports poorer sleep quality and has a late median sleep start (02:40 AM) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 93 min, Z = 0.22). Subjective sleep problems and late/variable sleep timing are often associated with higher depressive symptoms and appear as a relevant risk factor here.  
- Circadian and autonomic signals: Heart‑rate–derived circadian features show lower amplitude (Amplitude = 8.49, Z = −0.74) and reduced interdaily stability (IS = 0.29, Z = −0.99) and intradaily variability (IV = 0.31, Z = −1.66) relative to the sample. The mesor and resting heart rate are mildly elevated (Mesor = 78.34, Z = 0.6; Resting HR = 62.6, Z = 0.53). While the study correlations of these wearable metrics with CES‑D are small-to-moderate, reduced amplitude/regularity combined with slightly higher tonic heart rate is consistent with physiological patterns sometimes observed with increased depressive symptomatology.

Factors consistent with lower CES‑D scores (protective indicators)
- Regular physical activity: The participant reports frequent exercise (exercised alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07), and exercise shows a small negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ −0.09). Regular exercise is a plausibly protective behavior that could mitigate depressive symptoms.  
- Objective sleep quantity and low napping: Median sleep duration is approximately 7 h 12 min (near the sample mean) and mean daily naps are minimal (0.07 naps/day), both of which are not indicative of the hypersomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness patterns often associated with higher CES‑D scores.  
- Positive momentary affect and social engagement: The participant’s current happiness rating is above the sample mean (Happy = 4.0, Z = 0.55), and time spent socializing (1–2 hours daily, Z = 0.16) is at least moderate. Happiness has a moderate negative correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = −0.46); thus, this elevated momentary positive affect and ongoing social contact likely buffer against higher depressive symptom scores.  
- Low substance/drug use: Recreational and non‑prescribed drug use are reported as “not at all” (Z scores below the mean), which reduces risk related to substance‑associated mood problems.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the sample mean
Weighting measures by both their magnitude and their sample correlations with CES‑D, the profile points to a higher-than-average depressive symptom level in this participant. The most heavily weighted findings—elevated trait anxiety (strongest positive correlate) and reduced self‑esteem (strong negative correlate)—drive this conclusion. Supporting evidence includes subjective sleep disturbance and some circadian/physiological markers (reduced amplitude/stability, modestly higher tonic HR). Factors pulling the estimate downward (exercise, normative objective sleep duration, above‑average happiness, moderate social time, low napping and low drug use) temper the inference but do not fully offset the strong trait‑level risk signals. Thus, relative to the study population mean CES‑D score of 13.28, the participant’s pattern of measures is most consistent with CES‑D ""above the population mean.""

Limitations and cautionary notes
- Correlational interpretation: Several wearable metrics have small correlations with CES‑D in this sample, so their contribution to the inference is modest; the psychosocial trait measures (STAI, self‑esteem) carry disproportionate weight because of their large correlations.  
- Aggregation and temporal resolution: The hourly heart‑rate deviations and circadian summaries are aggregated across days and cannot resolve day‑to‑day fluctuations or acute episodes. Sleep start median and variability indicate late and somewhat inconsistent timing, but causal direction (e.g., whether mood influences schedule or vice versa) cannot be determined from these data alone.  
- Not a clinical diagnosis: This synthesis characterizes patterns associated with higher or lower depressive symptoms relative to the study sample but does not constitute a clinical diagnosis. If further assessment is required, targeted depressive symptom measurement (full CES‑D score, clinical interview) and longitudinal observation would provide greater precision.

If you would like, I can produce a prioritized list of features most predictive of CES‑D in this participant (ordered by study correlation and deviation from the sample mean) or suggest specific follow‑up assessments or analytic contrasts to refine the inference."
67709,"Summary: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a mixed but overall pattern that is more consistent with elevated depressive symptomatology relative to the study sample mean. Several self-report measures that are strongly correlated with CES‑D (notably trait anxiety and self‑esteem) show values in the direction associated with higher CES‑D scores; sleep timing and variability also point toward circadian fragility. At the same time, behavioral factors that are typically protective (regular social exercise, low substance use) and relatively low ambulatory physiological arousal provide countervailing evidence that mitigates but does not eliminate the indicators of elevated symptoms. On balance, the participant’s profile is best characterized as above the population mean CES‑D for this sample.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES‑D
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) is a strong indicator: the STAI–Trait scale has a high positive correlation with CES‑D in this study (r = 0.82), so this moderately elevated anxiety score provides substantial evidence toward higher depressive symptom levels.  
- Lower self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 33, Z = −0.73) is also relevant: self‑esteem is negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), and this participant’s below‑average self‑esteem is a well‑established psychosocial correlate of greater depressive symptoms.  
- Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 26, Z = 1.19); the PSS correlates positively with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.28), so elevated stress supports a higher CES‑D inference.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6; classified as disturbed sleep) and objective sleep timing/variability together point toward dysregulated sleep: although the median sleep duration is long, the median sleep start time is very late (≈ 03:45 AM) and sleep duration shows high night‑to‑night variability (SD = 173 minutes, Z = 1.65). Later and more variable sleep timing and higher sleep variability are associated with higher CES‑D (sleep variability correlation r ≈ 0.19; sleep‑timing correlation r ≈ 0.22), so these circadian/sleep features align with elevated depressive symptoms.  
- Certain leisure behaviors that show positive correlations with CES‑D are relatively high for this participant (internet use 3–4 hours/day, Z = 1.52; listening to music 2–3 hours/day, Z = 1.13), which modestly supports higher CES‑D estimates given their small positive correlations in the sample (r ≈ 0.25).

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES‑D
- Low substance use (no alcohol, no recreational or non‑prescribed drugs; Z scores well below sample mean) is a protective behavioral factor and is associated with lower CES‑D in population data (small correlations).  
- Frequent group exercise (exercised with others three times a week or more; Z = 1.23) is a notable protective factor: exercise with others shows a negative correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ −0.24), and the participant’s above‑average social exercise frequency is plausibly mitigating depressive symptom risk.  
- Wearable heart‑rate indicators suggest relatively low baseline physiological arousal: resting heart rate (53.4 bpm, Z = −0.56) and mesor (67.9, Z = −0.83) are below the sample mean. Although mesor/resting HR have modest positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.20), the participant’s lower values are directionally more consistent with lower—not higher—CES‑D.  
- Some circadian regularity metrics (intradaily variability = 0.46, Z = −0.60; interdaily stability = 0.38, Z = −0.24) are not strongly deviant from the sample and show little association with CES‑D in these data (correlations near zero), which weakens the case that circadian fragmentation is a primary driver of depressive symptoms here.

Interpretation of wearable circadian and hourly heart‑rate patterns
- The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced evening peak at 5–6 PM (deviation = +29.45, Z = 2.76), with smaller elevations earlier in the evening and low heart‑rate deviations across typical sleep hours. The large evening peak likely reflects a stable bout of physical activity or social/commute‑related exertion rather than generalized sympathetic hyperarousal; in the sample correlations these hourly deviations do not show a consistent positive relationship with CES‑D.  
- Although median sleep duration is longer than average (8 h 16 min, Z = 1.34), the very late median sleep onset (~03:45) and high night‑to‑night variability are notable: long but irregular and late-timed sleep can coexist with subjective sleep disturbance and is associated in this dataset with higher CES‑D.  
- Overall, circadian summary measures (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, interdaily stability, intradaily variability, 24‑hour autocorrelation) do not present a uniform signal; some features (lower mesor/resting HR) point away from elevated symptoms while the late and variable sleep schedule and increased sleep variability point toward higher symptoms.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample
- Considering the strongest and most CES‑D‑predictive indicators together (especially trait anxiety with a large sample correlation to CES‑D, lower self‑esteem with a large negative correlation, elevated perceived stress, and disturbed/irregular sleep timing), the preponderance of evidence supports an overall depressive symptom level above the study population mean (sample mean CES‑D = 13.27). Protective factors (frequent group exercise, low substance use, low resting HR) are meaningful but appear insufficient to offset the combination of high‑impact self‑report risk markers.  
- Thus, the participant’s profile is best described as above the population mean for depressive symptoms in this sample, with particular attention warranted to anxiety, self‑esteem, stress, and sleep timing/variability as contributors to that elevation."
36552,"Summary
The available self-report and wearable measures present a mixed but interpretable pattern with respect to depressive symptomatology. Several psychological self-reports and physiological markers point toward elevated affective distress (notably trait anxiety, perceived stress, and disturbed sleep), whereas robust indicators of functioning and resilience (high self‑esteem, regular solitary exercise, low substance use, and strong academic performance) argue for relatively preserved functioning. Taken together, these signals suggest the participant’s overall level of depressive symptoms is near the study population mean and likely modestly above it rather than substantially below or far above it.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms
Multiple measures that are positively associated with higher CES‑D scores converge on greater affective burden. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27) and the STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this dataset (r = 0.81), indicating that chronic anxiety proneness is a potent risk correlate. Perceived stress is also elevated (PSS = 24; Z = 0.65), and stress is positively associated with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.28). Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7) which commonly relates to greater depressive symptoms. Objective sleep metrics add to this picture: median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 23 min; Z = −1.0) and median sleep start is late (≈01:28), both patterns that commonly co-occur with mood symptoms. Physiologically, resting heart rate is higher than average (64.3 bpm; Z = 0.73) and circadian amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (amplitude Z = −1.07) while intradaily variability of activity/HR is elevated (IV Z = 1.23). Reduced circadian amplitude and greater fragmentation are often observed alongside depressive symptoms and may reflect blunted or disrupted daily rhythmicity. Self-reported current happiness is below the sample mean (score = 3.0; Z = −0.53), a direct subjective indicator related to mood.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
There are several substantial protective signals that counterbalance the above risks. Global self‑esteem is at the high end of the scale (Rosenberg score = 40; Z = 0.26) and self‑esteem correlates negatively with CES‑D in this sample (r = −0.71), which is a strong protective correlate. The participant reports frequent exercise alone (three times/week or more; Z = 1.07), low alcohol and drug use, no daily naps, and relatively low variability in sleep start times (sleep start SD = 49 min; Z = −0.75). Academic functioning is strong (GPAs consistently high), and general satisfaction with health is above average (health satisfaction score = 5; Z = 0.55). These behavioral and functional indicators typically accompany lower depressive symptom severity or greater resilience and reduce the likelihood of severe, pervasive depressive impairment.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
Balancing the risk and protective indicators, the data are most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms that is near the population mean CES‑D (population mean = 13.32, SD = 9.62) and likely modestly elevated relative to that mean. In other words, the profile does not strongly indicate minimal symptom burden, nor does it strongly indicate severe depressive symptomatology; instead it suggests a mixed presentation in which affective distress (anxiety, stress, disturbed sleep, some physiological markers of dysregulation) is present but is partially offset by strong self‑esteem, regular exercise, low substance use, and preserved academic functioning.

Limitations and interpretation caveats
This interpretation uses correlational guidance from the study sample and aggregated physiological summaries rather than a direct CES‑D score for the participant. Some wearable-derived circadian associations with CES‑D in this dataset are small or inconsistent, so physiological markers should be interpreted as supporting information rather than definitive indicators. If clinical or research decisions are to be made, direct CES‑D measurement and longitudinal follow-up (including targeted sleep and anxiety assessment) would provide stronger basis for inference."
63138,"Summary synthesis: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of signals. Trait anxiety (STAI = 40) is near the study sample average (Z = -0.13) but is a measure strongly correlated with CES-D in this sample (r = 0.81), meaning comparable anxiety proneness would typically co-occur with higher depressive symptoms. At the same time the participant reports high self-esteem (RSES = 38; Z ≈ -0.03; r with CES-D = -0.71), above-average momentary happiness (Current happy = 4.0; Z = 0.55; r = -0.46), and relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 0.38; r = -0.39). Academic performance is strong (GPAs ≈ 3.8–3.94). Taken together, several of the strongest-correlated self-report indicators point away from elevated depressive symptom burden, while anxiety and perceived stress (PSS = 23; Z = 0.38; r = 0.28) provide countervailing risk signals.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher depressive symptoms: Behavioral and physiological features that could align with greater symptom levels include elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate-derived circadian structure (Intradaily variability = 0.71; Z = 1.16). Higher intradaily fragmentation is often interpreted as less consolidated activity-rest structure and has been linked to mood disturbance in prior work, though its study-specific correlation with CES-D here is small (r = -0.05). Resting and overall heart-rate set points are slightly elevated (Resting HR = 62.9, Z = 0.56; Mesor = 77.14, Z = 0.44), and both show modest positive correlations with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.19), consistent with greater physiological arousal co-occurring with higher depressive symptoms. The participant’s late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:37) and long median nightly sleep (median duration = 8 h 21 min; Z = 1.45) may also be clinically relevant; late timing and hypersomnolence can be associated with mood disturbance in some individuals. Low frequency of exercise (exercised alone <1–2×/month; Z = -1.18) and modest alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.0) are behavioral patterns that, depending on context, may relate to risk for elevated depressive symptoms and lower resilience.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower depressive symptoms: Several robust protective signals appear. High self-esteem (RSES = 38) is strongly inversely associated with CES-D in this sample (r = -0.71) and is likely to exert a substantial downward influence on expected depressive symptom level. Self-reported current happiness above the sample mean (Z = 0.55; r = -0.46) and above-average interpersonal trust (Z = 0.5; r = -0.41) also align with lower reported depressive symptoms. The participant’s sleep timing is relatively consistent across nights (sleep start SD ≈ 58 min; Z = -0.54) and sleep duration shows low night-to-night variability (SD = 66 min; Z = -0.8), both of which typically reflect stable sleep patterns; stability in sleep timing and duration can be protective against mood fluctuations. Functioning-related indicators are favorable (high GPA, good health satisfaction), which also argue against a high depressive symptom burden.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean: Weighing the above evidence, the profile contains some risk-related features (trait anxiety, moderate perceived stress, elevated intradaily variability, late and relatively long sleep) but also multiple, relatively strong protective indicators (high self-esteem, above-average momentary happiness, stable sleep patterns, good academic functioning, and positive health satisfaction). Given the particularly strong inverse association between self-esteem and CES-D in this sample and the participant’s high self-esteem score, the balance of evidence points toward an overall depressive symptom level that is below the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.32). In sum: there are modest risk signals that merit attention (notably anxiety proneness, fragmented daytime patterning, late sleep timing, and low exercise), but the dominant pattern of self-reported well-being and functioning suggests depressive symptoms are likely lower than the sample average rather than elevated.

Clinical/scientific caveats: This inference integrates cross-sectional correlations, Z-scores, and wearable aggregates; it is not a replacement for direct CES-D scoring or clinical assessment. Several relevant metrics (e.g., PSQI global score) are missing, some correlations in the dataset are small, and wearable circadian measures are temporally aggregated (precluding detection of recent changes). If there is concern about mood or functional change over time, targeted follow-up (direct CES-D administration, sleep-quality assessment, and assessment of anxiety impact) would clarify current symptom burden."
16654,"Summary overview: Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics the participant shows a mixed but largely protective profile against depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is low (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72) and global self‑esteem is high (RSES = 39), both of which are strongly associated in this sample with lower CES‑D scores (large correlations reported for these instruments). Objective and subjective sleep quantity are within a healthy range (median sleep 7 h 46 min, Z = 0.73) with relatively low night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD 55 min, Z = -1.04) and no daytime napping. The participant also reports relatively high social activity (≈2–3 hours socializing, Z = 0.95), frequent group exercise (≥3×/week, Z = 1.23), and high health satisfaction (6/7, Z = 1.3). On balance these characteristics—low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, regular adequate sleep, active social and exercise behavior, and high health satisfaction—are all factors that, in this dataset, tend to be associated with lower CES‑D scores.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower depressive symptomatology: Psychometric indicators with the strongest sample-level associations to depressive symptoms point toward lower risk for this participant. Specifically, the participant’s low STAI trait score and near‑ceiling self‑esteem score are both robust negative predictors of CES‑D in the study correlations (STAI positively correlated with CES‑D; self‑esteem strongly negatively correlated). Behavioral engagement markers (frequent socializing and exercising with others) and objective regularity of daily physiology (high interdaily stability, robust cosinor amplitude, and low sleep timing variability) are additional protective signs. Wearable circadian features show a pronounced, regular rhythm (amplitude Z = 1.44; interdaily stability Z = 1.08) and low intraday fragmentation, which are generally consistent with better mood/functional outcomes in this sample.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher depressive symptomatology: There are a few signals that could pull toward higher depressive symptom levels. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is 6 (above the conventional PSQI cutoff of 5), which the participant also reported as “disturbed sleep”; subjective sleep problems can contribute to elevated depressive symptoms even when total sleep time looks adequate. The participant’s self‑reported current happiness is below the sample mean (Happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53), and perceived stress is moderate (PSS = 20). The participant’s sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:37 AM), which can be associated with mood vulnerability in some individuals. That said, these risk signals are modest in magnitude relative to the strong protective signals described above, and many wearable‑derived circadian/heart‑rate features in this dataset show only weak correlations with CES‑D (correlation coefficients near zero), so they should be interpreted cautiously.

Physiological and circadian profile: Heart‑rate based circadian metrics indicate a pronounced and regular daily rhythm (MESOR ≈ 78.1, amplitude relatively high, acrophase ~5:23 PM, interdaily stability elevated). Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected large nocturnal heart‑rate nadir and daytime elevations, with maximal deviations in the early afternoon—patterns consistent with a strong, entrained circadian system. Resting heart rate is mid‑range for the sample (≈59.7 bpm). These physiological features (high amplitude and stability, consistent sleep timing) are typically associated with better mood and functional outcomes, and in this dataset they do not strongly map onto higher CES‑D scores.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean: Taking the totality of evidence into account, the balance of indicators points toward an overall depressive symptom level below the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.34). The strongest and most predictive signals in the data—low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, frequent social/group exercise, consistent and adequate sleep duration, and robust circadian regularity—support a position lower than the mean. There are modest countervailing signs (subjective sleep disturbance per PSQI, late sleep timing, somewhat lower momentary happiness), but these are smaller in magnitude and/or have weaker sample correlations with CES‑D. Caveats: no CES‑D total score was provided for this individual, and several wearable–CES‑D correlations in this sample are small, so conclusions about absolute symptom severity should be considered probabilistic rather than diagnostic."
29134,"Summary of evidence that aligns with lower depressive symptom burden:
The participant shows multiple robust protective signals. Trait anxiety (STAI) — the feature most strongly correlated with CES-D in this dataset (r = 0.81) — is below the study mean (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33), indicating relatively low chronic anxiety proneness, which strongly favors lower depressive symptomatology. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39, Z = 0.11) and is strongly negatively associated with CES‑D in the sample (r = -0.71); this is another substantial factor pushing inference toward fewer depressive symptoms. Self‑reported current happiness is above average (score = 4, Z = 0.55; r with CES‑D = -0.46), interpersonal trust and health satisfaction are above average (trust Z = 0.83; health satisfaction Z = 0.55) and exercise with others is relatively frequent (Z = 1.23; r = -0.23). Wearable physiology is not indicative of acute autonomic hyperarousal: resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, Z = -0.33), mesor is slightly below average (Z = -0.56), and overall circadian interdaily stability is average (Z = 0.0). Taken together, these trait and behavioral indicators — especially the combination of low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem — constitute the strongest statistical reasons in the record to expect lower CES‑D scores.

Summary of evidence that aligns with higher depressive symptom burden:
There are notable sleep-related and behavioral signals associated with increased depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98), a relatively large deviation from the sample mean and a well-established correlate of depressive symptoms; PSQI in this range typically reflects clinically meaningful sleep disturbance. Objective sleep regularity is also compromised: high night-to-night variability in sleep start time (SD = 183 minutes, Z = 2.20) and high variability in total sleep duration (SD = 159 minutes, Z = 1.33) both correlate positively with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.20–0.22). Mean daily napping is slightly elevated (Z = 0.61; r ≈ 0.21). Wearable circadian amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude Z = -0.51) which, although a smaller effect in these data (r ≈ -0.10), can reflect blunted diurnal physiological range that has been linked to mood symptoms. Some daytime behavioral markers that have small positive correlations with CES‑D (e.g., not engaging in listening to music, Z = -1.19, r ≈ 0.25) and below-average socializing time (socializing Z = -0.62) add modest supportive evidence for increased symptom burden. Overall, the strongest single adverse signal in the record is poor subjective sleep quality combined with marked irregularity of sleep timing — these are the clearest contributors to higher CES‑D.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
Weighing the evidence, the record contains both strong protective traits (notably low trait anxiety and high self‑esteem) and prominent sleep-related risk signals (poor PSQI and very irregular sleep timing). In this dataset the largest effect-size predictors of CES‑D are anxiety and self‑esteem; because this participant scores favorably on both of those measures, the balance of evidence points to an overall depressive symptom level that is not substantially above the study population average. Compared with the study sample mean CES‑D of 13.31 (SD = 9.62; median = 11.0), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with a CES‑D near the population mean (that is, not clearly in the upper quartile). However, the magnitude of sleep disturbance and sleep timing irregularity represents a meaningful risk factor that could raise symptom levels relative to the protective trait profile if it persists.

Clinical implications and monitoring targets (interpretive, not diagnostic):
Given the mix of signals, the highest‑yield, non‑diagnostic targets for monitoring or intervention would be sleep quality and sleep regularity: subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11) and very large nightly timing variability (Z = 2.20) are the clearest actionable risk markers. Continued monitoring of mood symptoms alongside sleep patterns would clarify whether the poor sleep is driving an increase in depressive symptoms despite otherwise protective trait factors."
24029,"Summary of self-report indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile contains multiple robust psychosocial signals that align with elevated depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86) is substantially elevated and has a strong positive correlation with CES-D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), indicating a close relationship between the participant’s anxiety proneness and depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is low (RSES = 29, z = -1.29) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ -0.71), a pattern that typically accompanies higher depressive symptom levels. Perceived stress is markedly elevated (PSS = 30, z = 2.28), adding further risk because higher stress in this sample trends with higher CES-D. Subjective sleep quality is borderline-disturbed (PSQI = 6), consistent with reports of sleep-related difficulty that often co-occur with depressive symptoms. Current self-reported happiness is only modestly above average (z ≈ 0.55), but taken together the high anxiety, low self-esteem, and high perceived stress are the most salient self-report indicators pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Wearable measures provide a mixed picture. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 46 min, z ≈ -0.52) with moderate night-to-night variability in both duration and sleep-start time (SDs ≈ 99–102 minutes). The circadian summary measures show modest regularity overall (interdaily stability ≈ 0.42, z ≈ 0.09) but elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.70, z ≈ 1.09), which reflects greater fragmentation of activity/rest or cardiovascular rhythms within days. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.26, z ≈ -0.53), suggesting weaker day-to-day repetition of the heart-rate rhythm. The cosinor acrophase (≈ 2:19 PM) and a modest amplitude indicate a daytime peak in cardiovascular activity; resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, z ≈ -0.42). Aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal troughs (large negative deviations around 11 PM–3 AM) and a very large positive deviation in the early morning hour of 6–7 AM (z ≈ 4.77), implying a strong early-morning rise in heart rate on average. Elevated intradaily variability and somewhat shortened, irregular sleep are patterns that—while not determinative—are commonly associated with higher depressive symptom burden in population studies.

Behavioral lifestyle factors:
Several behavioral markers inferred from survey responses point in opposite directions. Protective characteristics include regular, frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others, and frequent sports; z-scores > 1) and very low substance use; these behaviors are associated in this dataset with lower CES-D (small inverse correlations). The participant also has a healthy BMI and strong academic performance historically (GPAs in the mid-3.6–3.7 range), which are additional contextual buffers. Conversely, the participant reports relatively limited social time (socializing z ≈ -0.62), high amounts of sedentary hobbies and music listening (z ≈ 2.0 and 2.06 respectively), and above-average time playing video games (z ≈ 2.47). Those leisure patterns have small positive correlations with CES-D in the sample and, together with limited social engagement, can contribute to risk for elevated depressive symptoms.

Balanced integration and likely CES-D level relative to the study population:
Balancing all evidence, the strongest, most consistent indicators of higher depressive symptoms are the elevated trait anxiety (STAI), markedly low self-esteem, and very high perceived stress—each of which shows substantial sample-level correlations with CES-D and therefore carry greater inferential weight. Wearable-derived signals (shorter-than-average sleep duration, elevated intradaily variability, and weaker 24-hour autocorrelation) provide convergent physiological support for increased risk, though their associations with CES-D in this dataset are smaller than the self-report correlations. Offsetting these risks are regular exercise, low substance use, low resting heart rate (suggesting fitness), and satisfactory academic functioning, which are modestly protective. On balance, the multimodal pattern is more consistent with an elevated level of depressive symptoms than with a low or average level.

Compared to the study sample’s CES-D distribution (mean = 13.29, SD = 9.61), the combined evidence suggests the participant’s depressive symptomatology is likely above the population mean. This inference rests primarily on the strong self-report signals (high anxiety, low self-esteem, high stress) supported by wearable-indicated sleep/circadian disturbance. Because correlations are associative and individual prediction from these inputs has uncertainty, this should be interpreted as a probabilistic assessment rather than a definitive score; clinical assessment or direct CES-D measurement would be required for precise classification or intervention planning."
35361,"Summary and overall inference
Across the available self-report and wearable measures, the preponderance of evidence points toward an overall level of depressive symptoms that is below the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.32). This inference rests on multiple protective indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, good subjective sleep, regular and robust circadian organization, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, and minimal substance use) that, in this sample, are associated with lower CES-D scores. A minority of measures (notably lower interpersonal trust and somewhat reduced socializing) point in the opposite direction; considered together, these risk-related features appear less influential than the stronger protective signals.

Protective features consistent with lower depressive symptoms
Several strong and medium-strength self-report markers favor lower CES-D levels. Trait anxiety (STAI = 38, z = -0.33) is below the sample mean and the STAI → CES-D correlation in this dataset is large and positive (0.81), so lower anxiety is a robust indicator of lower depressive symptoms. Self-esteem is at the instrument maximum (Rosenberg = 40, z = 0.26) and correlates strongly and negatively with CES-D (r = -0.71), another strong protective factor. Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, z = -1.26), which commonly relates to fewer depressive symptoms. The participant’s behavioral profile — frequent exercise (exercised alone three+ times/week, z = 1.07), no reported alcohol or drug use, and relatively low daily screen-time — also aligns with lower depression risk. Objective and circadian physiology further support this pattern: high interdaily stability (0.59, z = 1.49) and low intradaily variability (0.37, z = -1.24) indicate a regular, consolidated daily rhythm that is typically associated with better mood regulation. Resting heart rate and mesor are below the sample mean (resting HR = 49.8 bpm, z = -0.99; mesor = 67.8, z = -0.84), and amplitude of the circadian fit is above average (amplitude z = 0.87), a pattern often consistent with healthy autonomic modulation and lower symptom burden. Sleep timing is relatively regular (median sleep start ~00:58, sleep start SD 73 minutes, z ≈ -0.21) with median sleep duration near sample norms (6 h 56 m, z = -0.31) and low day-to-day variability (sleep duration SD z = -0.91), which together are consistent with preserved sleep-wake organization.

Features that could indicate higher depressive symptoms
A smaller set of measures point toward potential vulnerability. Interpersonal trust is relatively low (trust = 2.67, z = -1.10) and correlates negatively with well-being in this sample (r ≈ -0.41), so limited trust in others could relate to elevated depressive symptoms or reduced social support. Reported socializing time is below the sample mean (z = -0.62), which may reflect smaller social networks or less social engagement; social withdrawal can be a risk factor for depression. Perceived stress (PSS = 21, z = -0.17) is near the sample average and its positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.28) means that current stress does not strongly signal lower symptom levels and could sustain or elevate symptoms if stressors persist. Several wearable-to-CES-D correlations are small and mixed (e.g., modest positive correlations for resting HR and mesor), but the participant’s actual values for those metrics sit below the sample mean, so they do not in practice indicate elevated CES-D for this individual.

Physiological and circadian pattern interpretation
The wearable-derived circadian profile shows a clear nocturnal heart rate trough (large negative deviations from mesor during the 2–6 AM window) and a robust daytime rise with peak deviations in mid-day and afternoon hours (notably 11 AM–2 PM). High interdaily stability and positive amplitude indicate consistent, high-contrast circadian modulation of heart rate. Low intradaily variability suggests little fragmentation of activity/physiology across the day. Collectively these features imply stable sleep–wake timing and consolidated rest periods, which are generally protective against depressive symptoms. Median nightly sleep duration is slightly under 7 hours but not extreme, and there are no daytime naps; these objective sleep features align with the participant’s good subjective sleep report.

Balanced conclusion and comparative statement
Taken together, the strongest and most strongly correlated indicators (low trait anxiety, high self-esteem, good subjective sleep, regular circadian rhythms, frequent exercise, lack of substance use, and low resting heart rate) point toward a lower probability of elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. The main countervailing signals — low interpersonal trust and somewhat reduced socializing — warrant attention because they can sustain or exacerbate mood symptoms over time, but they are less numerous and generally weaker than the protective factors. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a CES-D level below the population mean (i.e., below 13.32), rather than near or above it.

Limitations
This inference is probabilistic and based on cross-sectional associations and aggregated wearable summaries rather than a directly reported CES-D score. Correlations provided with CES-D vary in magnitude across measures; no single metric determines symptom level. Changes in life context, acute stressors, or unmeasured psychological factors could alter the participant’s depressive symptom level."
49086,"Summary: The multi-modal profile presents a mix of protective and risk-related features for depressive symptoms. Strongly protective signals appear in self-report trait measures that have high statistical association with CES-D in this sample (notably low trait anxiety and relatively high self-esteem). Risk-related signals cluster around disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing and some behavioral inactivity (very low exercise), plus modestly elevated perceived stress and lower health satisfaction. When weighting the strength of associations in the dataset, the balance of evidence favors a symptom level at or below the study population mean rather than clearly above it.

Features that point toward relatively higher CES-D scores
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The PSQI score is 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), which commonly indexes sleep-related difficulties associated with greater depressive symptoms. Although wearable-derived median sleep duration is near average (7h18m), the subjective disturbance is an important risk signal because it often aligns with mood symptoms and functional complaints.
- Late and variable sleep timing with nocturnal physiological arousal: Median sleep onset is late (≈02:19 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈78 min). Wearable hourly heart-rate aggregation shows elevated deviation from mesor around midnight (12–1am; Z = 1.66), suggesting greater physiological activation late at night. Late sleep timing and late-night arousal are both linked in the literature to worse mood and to circadian misalignment, and here they constitute a behavioral/physiological risk pattern.
- Low physical activity / exercise: The participant reports essentially no exercise (very negative Z-scores across solo and group exercise). Reduced exercise has a modest negative correlation with CES-D in these data and is a behavioral factor that can maintain or exacerbate low mood.
- Modest psychosocial strain: Perceived stress is slightly elevated (PSS = 23, Z = 0.38) and self-rated health satisfaction is lower than average (Z ≈ -0.7); both correlate with higher CES-D in the sample (stress positively, lower health satisfaction negatively), indicating some psychosocial contributors to symptom risk.

Features that point toward relatively lower CES-D scores
- Low trait anxiety and high self-esteem (strong predictors): The STAI–Trait score is low (31; Z = -1.02) and the self-esteem measure is relatively high (Z = +1.1). These two measures have some of the largest sample correlations with CES-D (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self-esteem r ≈ -0.71). Their direction and magnitude strongly favor a lower CES-D score for this participant and weigh heavily in the overall inference.
- Functional indicators and healthy physiology: Academic performance is high (GPAs in the mid-to-high 3s), socializing time is relatively high (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95), and wearable-derived resting heart rate and mesor are lower than the sample mean (resting HR 56.3 bpm, mesor Z = -0.61), which together suggest preserved daytime functioning and cardiovascular fitness — factors typically associated with lower depressive symptom severity.
- Adequate total sleep duration and limited napping: Median sleep duration is within a typical range (≈7h18m; Z ≈ +0.15) and nap frequency is low, reducing the likelihood that total sleep insufficiency alone is driving depressive symptoms.

Circadian and wearable-derived context
- Circadian rhythm metrics show modest departures but no extreme disruption: Amplitude is slightly lower than the sample mean (Z = -0.57) and interdaily stability and intradaily variability are near the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.16 and -0.18). Lower amplitude and some phase-delayed sleep timing can be associated with mood disturbance, but the wearable correlations with CES-D in this dataset are generally small (most r values near zero), indicating limited predictive weight compared with the strong self-report predictors.
- Hourly heart-rate profile suggests relative nocturnal activation and typical daytime peak: The aggregated hourly deviations show an elevation around late night/midnight and the acrophase at ~5:43 PM, consistent with typical daytime activity peaks but with some added late-night arousal. These physiological data corroborate the subjective report of disturbed sleep timing but, in isolation, have only small correlations with CES-D in this sample.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean
- Taking the full set of data into account — and giving greater weight to measures with stronger sample correlations to CES-D — the participant’s profile is most consistent with a depressive symptom level below the study population mean (population CES-D mean = 13.34, SD = 9.6). The particularly low trait anxiety and relatively high self-esteem, both strongly associated with lower CES-D in the sample, outweigh the modest-to-moderate risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, late sleep timing/nocturnal arousal, low exercise, and somewhat elevated stress). Thus, the composite signal points toward CES-D scores that are likely near or below the population mean rather than clearly above it.

Caveats
- The conclusion is probabilistic and based on correlational strengths in the available sample; self-report and wearable signals sometimes diverge (e.g., objective sleep duration is adequate while subjective sleep quality is poor). Direct CES-D score for this participant was not provided, so inference is indirect. If clinical decision-making is intended, direct assessment of depressive symptoms (CES-D or diagnostic interview) and follow-up of sleep timing, stress, and activity would provide clearer information."
95490,"Summary of symptom-relevant self-report indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile contains several signal features that are commonly associated with higher depressive symptomatology. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 47; z = +0.56), and this measure in the study sample shows a strong positive correlation with CES‑D (r = 0.81), making it one of the most informative self-report predictors here. Self‑esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 34; z = −0.59) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which also points toward higher depressive symptom risk. Current self‑rated happiness is lower than average (z = −0.53; r with CES‑D = −0.46) and perceived stress is modestly elevated (PSS = 23; z = +0.38; r = 0.28), both consistent with greater depressive symptoms in the sample. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score crosses the conventional threshold for disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”; z ≈ −0.33), providing subjective evidence of sleep difficulty that often co-occurs with higher CES‑D scores.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics:
Objective sleep and circadian measures show patterns that align with increased depressive symptom risk. Median nightly sleep duration is slightly below the sample mean (6 h 56 min; z = −0.30) and sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 01:11 AM) with substantial night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 101 minutes; z = +0.40). Variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep duration SD ~103 min; z ≈ 0.04) is modestly positively correlated with CES‑D in this dataset (r ≈ 0.20–0.22), suggesting that irregular sleep may be contributing to symptom burden. Circadian regularity metrics derived from heart rate show reduced stability (interdaily stability = 0.23; z = −1.48) and only modest 24‑hour autocorrelation (z = −1.12), indicating a relatively weak day‑to‑day structure in physiological rhythms. The amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm is lower than average (amplitude = 8.34; z = −0.79), which can reflect blunted diurnal variation; these features are often observed in samples with higher depressive symptoms.

Physiological arousal pattern across the day:
Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced late‑afternoon/evening elevations in heart rate (largest positive deviations at 4–6 PM; z = +1.14 and +0.89) with larger negative deviations overnight and early morning (e.g., −15 beats around 3–7 AM). Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly above the sample mean (resting HR = 61.4 bpm, z = +0.39; mesor = 77.1, z = +0.43); both show small-to-moderate positive correlations with CES‑D in these data (r ≈ 0.19). Overall, the physiological profile reflects a preserved nocturnal dip but reduced circadian amplitude and greater late‑day arousal relative to peers—features that can be associated with stress, anxiety, and higher depressive symptoms but are not independently diagnostic.

Behavioral and social factors that may mitigate or accentuate risk:
Several lifestyle and functional indicators provide a mixed picture. Protective or mitigating features include relatively frequent solitary exercise (exercised alone three or more times per week; z = +1.07), substantial time socializing with friends (2–3 hours; z = +0.95), good academic performance (multiple GPAs in the mid‑3.0s), and only limited daytime napping—behaviors that tend to associate with lower CES‑D scores or preserved functioning. Conversely, certain recreational patterns and subjective health indices show less protective value: relatively high time listening to music (z = +0.67) in this sample is positively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.25), and alcohol use at about 1–2 times per week has a z near +1.0 (though its correlation with CES‑D here is near zero). Health satisfaction is slightly below the sample mean (z ≈ −0.28). Taken together, behavioral data indicate active engagement in exercise and social time that may buffer mood symptoms, while other habits and subjective health concerns may offer limited protection.

Balance of evidence and comparative statement:
Weighing the multimodal evidence, there are several relatively strong indicators pointing toward elevated depressive symptoms—most notably elevated trait anxiety (highly correlated with CES‑D), reduced self‑esteem (strong negative correlate), lower self‑reported happiness, disturbed subjective sleep, and objectively reduced circadian stability/amplitude. These factors carry relatively large correlations with CES‑D in the study sample and are supported by wearable measures of irregular sleep timing and blunted diurnal heart‑rate variation. Offsetting evidence includes protective behaviors (regular exercise, appreciable social time, and preserved academic functioning), which are associated with lower CES‑D or maintained functioning. Overall, however, the preponderance of symptom‑relevant signals suggests this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.31). This conclusion is informed by both the strength of the trait anxiety and self‑esteem signals (highly correlated with CES‑D in this dataset) and the corroborating sleep/circadian irregularities.

Notes on inference and limitations:
These inferences synthesize self‑report and wearable indicators that are correlated with depressive symptoms in the study sample but do not constitute a clinical diagnosis. Correlations reported in the dataset guided weighting of features (e.g., the strong STAI–CES‑D link), but causal direction cannot be inferred from cross‑sectional or aggregated measures. Where available, I prioritized measures with larger z‑score deviations and stronger CES‑D correlations when integrating evidence."
90079,"Summary inference
Across the multimodal data, the participant presents a mixed pattern but overall shows several characteristics that, taken together, are most consistent with depressive symptom levels modestly above the study population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.31). This inference is driven primarily by objective markers of circadian disruption and short, irregular sleep together with elevated perceived stress and lower self-reported positive affect; these features outweigh several protective indicators (e.g., relatively preserved trait anxiety and self‑esteem, low substance use). Given the absence of a directly reported CES‑D total for this individual in the provided data, this conclusion is probabilistic (inferred) rather than definitive.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Sleep and circadian measures: The wearable-derived sleep profile shows short median nightly sleep (5 h 54 min; Z = -1.59) and substantial night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD = 138 min; Z = 0.84). The median sleep start is late (≈01:53), with moderately elevated start‑time variability (SD Z = 0.46). These objective sleep deficits and irregular timing are commonly associated with higher depressive symptoms and poorer mood regulation.  
- Circadian rhythm fragmentation and blunted amplitude: Interdaily stability is low (0.21; Z = -1.65), intradaily variability is relatively high (0.75; Z = 1.44), and circadian amplitude is low (6.53; Z = -1.37). This pattern — weak day‑to‑day regularity, more fragmented activity/rhythm within days, and reduced amplitude — typically correlates with worse mood and has been linked in the literature with elevated depression scores.  
- Physiological arousal: Resting heart rate is slightly elevated (65.6 bpm; Z = 0.89) and the mesor is somewhat higher than average (MESOR = 76.93; Z = 0.41). Elevated tonic cardiovascular markers can be associated with greater affective distress; correlations in the dataset (resting HR correlation with CES‑D ≈ 0.19) are consistent with a modest positive relationship.  
- Self‑report affect and stress: The participant reports lower current happiness (score = 3.0; Z = -0.53) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 24; Z = 0.65). The PSQI indicates disturbed subjective sleep (score = 7), aligning with objective short sleep and variability. Low interpersonal trust (Z = -1.42) may also reflect reduced perceived social resources, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Trait measures and behaviors: Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI = 38; Z = -0.33), and self‑esteem is reasonably high (Rosenberg score = 34; Z = -0.59), both of which are protective against depression or associated with lower CES‑D scores (noting strong negative correlation between self‑esteem and CES‑D in the sample).  
- Low substance use and some social/exercise engagement: The participant reports essentially no alcohol or recreational drug use (large negative Zs versus the sample), and engages in exercise 1–2 times per week (both alone and with others). Socializing is present (1–2 hours/day), and these lifestyle factors generally reduce risk or moderate symptoms.  
- Absence of some classic behavioral correlates: The participant does not report high amounts of commonly depressogenic sedentary or isolative activities (e.g., does not watch TV/videos for long periods, does not play video games), which may mitigate symptom severity.

Holistic synthesis and interpretation
When balancing all sources, the most salient and convergent signals are circadian/sleep disruption (short, late, and irregular sleep; low interdaily stability; high intradaily variability; decreased amplitude) together with elevated perceived stress and lower momentary happiness. These features are robustly linked to higher CES‑D scores in the literature and in the study correlations and therefore drive the overall inference that this participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the sample mean (i.e., greater than 13.31), probably in a modestly elevated range rather than extreme. Countervailing evidence — non‑elevated trait anxiety, reasonably high self‑esteem, low substance use, and some social/exercise activity — suggest that symptom severity may be attenuated relative to profiles showing both strong circadian disruption and pervasive psychosocial risk. Finally, correlations between individual wearable metrics and CES‑D in the sample are generally modest, so while the pattern supports a higher‑than‑average symptom level, the strength of inference is moderate and would be strengthened by a direct CES‑D total or clinical assessment.

Research implications
From a research perspective, the combination of objective circadian disruption and short, variable sleep alongside elevated perceived stress and lower positive affect is an important cluster to monitor longitudinally as a predictor of increasing depressive symptoms. Inclusion of a direct CES‑D score and monitoring change over time would clarify whether the inferred elevation is stable or transient."
22842,"Summary statement
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed profile with several signals that are commonly associated with elevated depressive symptomatology and some features that are plausibly protective. On balance—taking into account the relatively high trait anxiety (STAI), low self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep quality, late and highly variable sleep timing, and increased napping—the overall pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean CES-D (population mean = 13.29). This inference is based on converging indicators that have moderately strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (e.g., STAI r = 0.81; self‑esteem r = -0.71) and on objective behavioral signs of circadian and sleep irregularity.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher depressive symptoms
Several self-report measures strongly suggest vulnerability to higher depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 46; z = 0.46) and strongly positively correlated with CES-D in the sample (r = 0.81), a robust risk factor. Self‑esteem is lower than the study average (RSES = 36; z = -0.31) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D (r = -0.71), which again supports higher symptom levels. Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 10; z = 1.52), and disturbed sleep is frequently associated with higher depressive symptom scores. Objective sleep timing shows a very late median sleep onset (≈ 02:56) with high night-to-night variability (sleep start SD z = 1.79) and an elevated mean daily nap frequency (0.28 naps/day; z = 2.4). Both late, irregular sleep timing and greater napping are correlated positively with CES-D in this dataset (napping r ≈ 0.21; sleep variability r ≈ 0.21) and indicate behavioral patterns often accompanying higher depressive symptoms. Additional behavioral indicators that map to higher CES-D in the sample include lower self-reported happiness (current = 3.0; z = -0.53) and a moderate perceived stress level (PSS = 22; z = 0.1).

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
There are several features that could attenuate the likelihood of very high CES-D scores. Objective median nightly sleep duration is above average (7 h 51 m; z = 0.83), which is protective relative to short sleep duration. The participant reports frequent exercise alone (three or more times per week; z = 1.07), and low substance use (alcohol and drugs well below sample means), both of which are typically associated with lower depressive symptoms. Health satisfaction is relatively high (z = 0.88) and correlates negatively with CES-D in the sample (r ≈ -0.39), again suggesting some resilience. Resting heart rate and mesor are on the lower side of the sample (resting HR = 54.2 bpm; mesor = 69.34), which may reflect good cardiovascular fitness—this is not a clear indicator of depressive symptoms in the present correlations and does not offset the stronger psychological signals above.

Physiological/circadian pattern interpretation
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show reduced rhythm robustness and some nocturnal elevations in cardiovascular activity. Interdaily stability (0.30; z = -0.9) and amplitude (8.7; z = -0.67) are lower than the sample mean, suggesting less stable and lower-amplitude circadian organization of heart rate over the recording period. The hourly aggregate deviations show unexpected modest positive deviations around 1–2 AM (1–2 AM value positive; z ≈ 1.49) alongside large negative deviations through the early morning, consistent with irregular nocturnal arousal relative to the participant’s mesor. These circadian irregularities and nocturnal arousal features (and the high sleep onset variability) map to known behavioral phenotypes that, in this sample, are modestly associated with higher CES-D scores. That said, correlations between many wearable circadian metrics and CES‑D are small-to-moderate in this dataset, so physiological signals should be interpreted as complementary rather than definitive.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean
Weighing the evidence, the participant’s profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels above the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.29). The strongest contributors to this inference are elevated trait anxiety (STAI), lower self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), late and highly variable sleep timing, and increased daytime napping—variables that have the largest sample correlations with CES‑D in this dataset. Protective factors—adequate nightly sleep duration, regular physical activity, low substance use, and relatively high health satisfaction—moderate but do not appear to fully counterbalance the risk signals in the psychological and circadian domains.

Limitations and cautions
This interpretation integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable metrics and cannot substitute for clinical assessment. Correlations reported here indicate associations within the study sample but do not establish causation. The CES‑D inference is probabilistic and should be used to guide further assessment or monitoring rather than to make categorical diagnostic claims."
14279,"Summary and overall inference
Across the multimodal dataset, the participant presents a pattern of strengths and a smaller set of risk indicators. On balance, the profile is more consistent with lower-than-average depressive symptom burden in this study sample. Using the provided population benchmark (mean CES-D = 13.33, SD = 9.61), the combination of measures (notably very high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, relatively stable circadian physiology, and adequate objective sleep duration) weighs toward an inferred CES‑D score below the population mean. This inference reflects the relative magnitude and psychometric relevance of those protective markers (see below), while acknowledging several modest risk signals that warrant monitoring.

Features suggesting lower depressive symptom levels
Several strong, convergent protective signals appear in the data. The participant’s Rosenberg self‑esteem score is at the scale maximum (40; Z = 0.26), and self‑esteem shows a strong inverse correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = −0.71); this single measure is a potent indicator of lower depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI = 38; Z = −0.33), which also aligns with lower depressive symptom risk given the high correlation of STAI with mood measures in the sample. Wearable-derived circadian metrics are relatively robust: amplitude is high (14.2; Z = 1.11), interdaily stability is above average (0.48; Z = 0.58), and 24‑hour autocorrelation is high (0.42; Z = 0.81). These characteristics indicate a regular, well‑entrained heart‑rate rhythm across days, a pattern that is generally associated in the literature with better mood and functioning and that in this sample shows small negative correlations with depressive symptoms. Objective sleep duration is comparatively long (median 8 h 11 min; Z = 1.24), and resting heart rate is within a typical range (59 bpm; Z = 0.10), both of which are more consistent with preserved physiological functioning. The participant also reports some social and physical activity (exercising with others and sports at frequencies above sample mean; Z ≈ 0.5–0.9), which are behavioral factors that tend to protect against depressive symptoms.

Features suggesting higher depressive symptom levels
There are several modest or domain‑specific indicators that point toward elevated depressive symptoms relative to the participant’s protective profile. Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7; Z = 0.13), and subjective sleep complaints often relate to mood symptoms even when objective sleep duration is adequate. Current self‑reported happiness is lower than the sample mean (score = 3.0; Z = −0.53), and lower happiness correlates with higher CES‑D (r ≈ −0.46). Interpersonal trust is low (score = 2.33; Z = −1.74), and lower trust is associated in the sample with higher depressive symptoms (r ≈ −0.42), which may indicate social‑cognitive or relational vulnerability. The participant reports little engagement with some leisure/hobby activities (e.g., listening to music, reading, sedentary hobbies — Z scores well below the mean), a behavioral pattern that could reflect reduced reward‑seeking or pleasurable activity. Wearable intradaily variability (0.62; Z = 0.53) indicates some fragmentation of the day‑to‑day activity pattern; fragmentation is only modest here but is sometimes associated with mood symptoms. Finally, self‑reported perceived stress is at a mid level (PSS = 20; Z = −0.44), which is not high relative to the sample but correlates positively with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.28) and can exacerbate mood vulnerability.

Integrated interpretation and clinical relevance
Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most relevant predictors in this dataset point to lower depressive symptomatology relative to peers in the study: very high self‑esteem, low trait anxiety, clearly present circadian rhythm amplitude and stability, adequate objective total sleep, and active engagement in group exercise/sports. These markers have relatively large effect sizes or theoretical importance for mood. Countervailing signals (subjective sleep disturbance, reduced momentary happiness, low interpersonal trust, and limited engagement in some leisure activities) are notable but smaller in magnitude and less pervasive across domains. Accordingly, the most defensible overall conclusion is that the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study population mean CES‑D score (i.e., below 13.33), although there are specific, monitorable areas (subjective sleep quality, affective experience, and interpersonal trust/engagement) where subthreshold symptoms or situational stressors may be present.

Limitations and recommendations
This inference is probabilistic and contingent on cross‑sectional and aggregated data: the heart‑rate metrics are temporally aggregated and cannot resolve day‑to‑day shifts or acute episodes; correlations provided are sample‑level associations, not causal effects; and no formal diagnostic assessment is available. For practical follow‑up, it would be useful to track subjective mood and sleep quality longitudinally, assess social functioning and trust in more detail, and consider behavioral activation or sleep‑focused interventions if subjective sleep complaints or lowered positive affect persist."
28327,"Summary of self-report indicators (factors consistent with higher depressive symptoms)
The survey profile contains several strong self-report signals that are associated with higher CES‑D scores. Trait anxiety (STAI = 58, z = +1.65) is markedly elevated and has a very large positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it one of the most salient risk indicators. Self‑esteem is low (RSES = 26, z = −1.71) and is strongly inversely related to depressive symptoms in the study (r = −0.70). Current self‑rated happiness is low (score = 2, z = −1.61; r = −0.46), and the participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 9, z = +1.05). Perceived stress is elevated (PSS = 24, z = +0.65; r = +0.28) and health satisfaction is low (z = −1.86; r = −0.39). Taken together, these self‑report measures point to a pattern of heightened internal distress, low positive affect and self‑worth, and sleep complaints — all factors that, in this sample, tend to co‑occur with higher CES‑D scores.

Wearable physiological and circadian indicators (mixed evidence)
Wearable heart‑rate and circadian metrics present a mixed but largely non‑conclusive picture with respect to depressive symptoms. Resting heart rate (60.2 bpm, z = +0.24; r = +0.19) is within a typical range but shows a small positive association with CES‑D in the sample. The cosinor-derived amplitude of the 24‑hour rhythm is relatively large (amplitude z = +1.04) and interdaily stability is somewhat above average (z = +0.67), which generally indicate a robust, regular circadian pattern; both of these features have weak or negligible correlations with CES‑D here (amplitude r = −0.11; interdaily stability r ≈ 0). Intradaily variability (z = +1.02) is elevated, suggesting more fragmented within‑day heart‑rate patterns, though its correlation with CES‑D is small (r = −0.06). Hourly aggregate deviations show the largest relative heart‑rate elevations in the early evening (peaks around 6–8 pm; large positive z‑scores) and clear nocturnal decreases, consistent with preserved nocturnal autonomic down‑regulation. Overall, wearable metrics neither strongly corroborate nor strongly contradict the self‑report risk profile; they show preserved circadian amplitude and sleep‑related heart‑rate drops (potentially protective) alongside some within‑day fragmentation (a weak risk signal).

Behavioral and contextual protective factors (factors consistent with lower depressive symptoms)
Several behavioral and contextual features are protective or neutral with respect to depressive symptoms. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 37 min (z = +0.54) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD and start‑time SD not extreme), suggesting generally adequate sleep duration despite the participant’s subjective sleep complaints. Academic performance is strong (GPA in the 3.3–3.8 range), interpersonal trust is relatively high (z = +1.47; r = −0.42), recreational drug use is absent, and exercise occurs (albeit limited) 1–2 times per week. Alcohol use is occasional but not heavy. These patterns (adequate sleep duration, preserved academic functioning, social trust, low substance use) are features that in this sample tend to be associated with lower or average CES‑D scores and thus moderate the risk suggested by self‑report distress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the information, the largest and most diagnostically relevant signals come from self‑report measures that have strong sample correlations with CES‑D (especially STAI and self‑esteem) and are substantially deviant from the study population mean in directions associated with greater depressive symptoms. Wearable-derived physiology provides a more equivocal picture, with some indicators of preserved circadian amplitude and normal sleep‑related heart‑rate dipping that mitigate risk but do not overturn the self‑report evidence. On balance, the pattern of data is most consistent with depressive symptomatology above the study population mean (population CES‑D mean = 13.26). The magnitude and consistency of elevated trait anxiety, low self‑esteem, low happiness, elevated perceived stress, and disturbed subjective sleep suggest a greater than average CES‑D score for this participant rather than a score near or below the mean.

Clinical/research implications
This multimodal profile indicates elevated depressive symptom risk relative to peers and warrants targeted follow‑up (e.g., direct CES‑D assessment if not already obtained, clinical interview, or monitoring/intervention focusing on anxiety, self‑esteem, and perceived sleep problems). At the same time, preserved sleep duration, circadian amplitude, academic functioning, interpersonal trust, and low substance use are strengths that could be leveraged in interventions."
52302,"Summary: The participant’s data present a mixed multimodal profile with signal in both directions for depressive symptoms. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) and some sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) point toward elevated affective risk, whereas very high self‑esteem (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11), moderate self‑reported happiness (Current = 4.0, Z = 0.55), substantial social time (3–4 hours, Z = 1.74), low resting heart rate (52.5 bpm, Z = −0.67) and low substance use point toward lower depressive symptom burden. Circadian and wearable-derived metrics show a relatively robust daytime amplitude with afternoon peaks and a late, variable sleep schedule. Considering the pattern of associations provided (notably the strong correlations of STAI with CES‑D [r ≈ 0.82] and of self‑esteem with CES‑D [r ≈ −0.71]), the data are ambivalent but do not indicate a clearly extreme CES‑D value.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher CES‑D scores: The participant’s trait anxiety score is elevated and, among the measures provided, has the strongest positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.82). The PSQI = 6 meets the conventional cutoff for disturbed sleep, and sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:08) with moderate night‑to‑night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 103 minutes; sleep duration SD ≈ 123 minutes); both disturbed subjective sleep and irregular sleep timing have been linked to greater depressive symptoms in prior work. Napping frequency is slightly above average (mean daily naps = 0.13, Z = 0.7) and correlates positively with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.21). Finally, some sedentary/recreational patterns (elevated time watching video content and gaming; Zs > 1.2) show small positive correlations with CES‑D in this dataset.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower CES‑D scores: The participant reports very high self‑esteem (RSES = 39), and the self‑esteem–CES‑D correlation is strongly negative (r ≈ −0.71), which is a substantial protective signal against depressive symptoms. Current self‑reported happiness and trust in others are above average (Zs ≈ 0.55 and 0.50, respectively) and both correlate negatively with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.46 and r ≈ −0.41), consistent with lower symptom level. Behavioral indicators that often align with lower depression—low substance use (no alcohol or drugs reported), regular social time (3–4 hours), and routine exercise (1–2 times per week alone and with others)—are present. Physiologically, resting heart rate is below the sample mean (52.5 bpm, Z = −0.67), which in this dataset is associated with lower CES‑D risk (the resting HR–CES‑D correlation is small-to-moderate and positive for higher HR), and the cosinor amplitude of heart rate shows a clear daytime peak (amplitude Z = 0.5), consistent with preserved circadian amplitude rather than flattened rhythms often seen in more severe depression.

Circadian and aggregated heart‑rate interpretation: Heart‑rate cosinor metrics show a mesor slightly below the sample mean (MESOR = 71.9 bpm, Z = −0.28) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:17 PM) with above‑average amplitude (Z = 0.5). Interdaily stability is modestly below average (Z ≈ −0.33) but intradaily variability is relatively low (Z ≈ −0.95), indicating a rhythm that has a clear daytime peak but some variability in day‑to‑day timing. Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and afternoon peaks (largest positive deviations in the early afternoon), and most hour‑by‑hour correlations with CES‑D are small. Overall, the wearable circadian profile does not show strong physiologic signatures that would unambiguously indicate elevated depressive symptom severity (e.g., markedly blunted amplitude or highly unstable rhythms); rather it suggests preserved diurnal structure with some variability in sleep timing.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the strong but opposing predictors (notably elevated trait anxiety versus very high self‑esteem and positive social/habit indicators), the multimodal evidence places this participant’s inferred depressive symptom level near the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.32). The data contain important risk signals—chiefly trait anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep—that warrant clinical attention or targeted screening for depressive symptoms, but they are counterweighted by multiple protective signals (high self‑esteem, reported happiness, social engagement, low resting HR and low substance use). Given the competing strong correlates, the most defensible position from these data is that the participant’s depressive symptom level is neither clearly elevated well above the sample mean nor clearly low—rather, it appears approximately near the mean, with specific domains (anxiety, sleep timing/quality) that merit focused follow‑up."
46418,"Protective indicators (features associated with lower CES‑D in this dataset)
The participant exhibits several robust markers that, in this sample, are associated with lower depressive symptom scores. Trait measures show relatively high self‑esteem (Rosenberg score = 38; z ≈ -0.03) and a sub‑mean level of trait anxiety (STAI = 38; z ≈ -0.33). These two measures have strong sample correlations with depressive symptoms in the provided data (self‑esteem r = -0.71; STAI r = +0.82), so the combination of low anxiety proneness and high self‑esteem is a substantial protective signal. Objective physiological and behavioral rhythm metrics further support resilience: interdaily stability is above average (0.53; z = +1.0) and intradaily variability is markedly low (0.30; z = -1.73), indicating consistent day‑to‑day structure and low fragmentation of heart‑rate rhythms—factors that are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology. Amplitude of the circadian heart‑rate rhythm is relatively large (15.07; z = +1.39), and the participant’s median nightly sleep duration (7 h 44 min; z = +0.69) and low sleep timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 52 min; z ≈ -0.68) argue for objectively adequate and regular sleep quantity. Behavioral engagement that tends to protect mood is also present: frequent group exercise and sports (exercise with others z ≈ +1.23; sports z ≈ +1.58) and limited napping (mean daily naps = 0; z ≈ -0.86).

Risk indicators (features associated with higher CES‑D in this dataset)
There are several features that suggest elevated risk or sources of symptom burden. The participant’s subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11; z ≈ +1.98; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating notable perceived sleep problems despite adequate objective sleep duration. Subjective sleep disturbance is frequently linked to higher depressive symptoms in clinical and community samples and may amplify risk when coupled with other stressors. Perceived stress is slightly above the sample mean (PSS = 22; z ≈ +0.10), and current self‑reported happiness is only modest (current happiness = 4.0; z ≈ +0.55), which—although not extreme—do not strongly offset sleep complaints. Daily behaviors that can co‑occur with depressive symptoms include above‑average passive screen time (watching TV/videos 1–2 hours; z ≈ +1.28). The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a pronounced evening peak, particularly 5–6pm (deviation +26.09; z ≈ +2.27). While this likely reflects evening activity (e.g., sports or social activity) and can be adaptive, elevated evening physiological arousal could also contribute to subjective sleep initiation difficulties given the very late median sleep start time (median sleep start ≈ 01:49).

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Weighing these signals holistically, the preponderance of evidence points toward a relatively lower level of depressive symptoms compared with the study sample mean. The strongest statistical weights in the dataset—the trait anxiety (STAI, r = +0.82) and self‑esteem (r = -0.71)—both point away from elevated depressive symptoms for this participant. Objective circadian regularity, low intradaily variability, robust amplitude, adequate median sleep duration, frequent organized or group exercise, and absence of daytime naps are additional indicators that commonly align with lower CES‑D scores. Countervailing evidence—most notably the high PSQI (z ≈ +1.98), late habitual sleep onset (≈1:49 AM), modest perceived stress, and some passive media time—indicates areas of symptom burden or behaviors that could elevate risk. Taking the balance and the relative magnitudes into account, the participant’s profile is best characterized as below the population mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.3), rather than near or above it, but not without notable sleep‑related complaints that merit attention.

Caveats and actionable considerations
This inference is probabilistic and indirect: it relies on trait measures, behavioral patterns, and physiological proxies rather than a directly reported CES‑D total for the participant. The most salient mismatch is the discrepancy between objective sleep regularity/duration and markedly poor subjective sleep (PSQI = 11). Given the known bidirectional relationships between subjective sleep disturbance and mood, targeted evaluation of sleep quality (sleep onset latency, nocturnal awakenings, pre‑sleep arousal) and brief reassessment of depressive symptoms would clarify whether the subjective sleep complaints are transient or part of a broader affective pattern. If further assessment is warranted, brief screening with the CES‑D or a clinical interview focused on mood and sleep would be the next step."
93002,"Summary: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a mixed but coherent profile. Several self-report measures that are strongly associated with depressive symptomatology—trait anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep quality, and lower current happiness—pull in the direction of elevated depressive symptoms. In contrast, multiple objective wearable indicators (notably a relatively regular 24-hour heart-rate rhythm, modest circadian amplitude, and a low resting heart rate) and health-supporting behaviors (low substance use and some weekly exercise with others) provide evidence that runs counter to a clear, severe depressive presentation. Below I enumerate the most salient indicators that point toward higher versus lower depressive symptom burden and then give an integrated judgment relative to the study population mean CES‑D score.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 40), a measure that has a very strong correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r ≈ 0.81), which is a robust risk indicator for higher depressive symptom scores. Self‑esteem is lower than the study mean (RSES = 32, z ≈ -0.87) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r ≈ -0.71), again suggesting greater depression risk. Subjective sleep problems are notable: PSQI = 9 (z ≈ +1.05), which exceeds common clinical cutoffs for poor sleep and is a known correlate of elevated depressive symptoms. Wearable sleep metrics align with this subjective disturbance: median nightly sleep is relatively short (6 h 28 m, z ≈ -0.88), sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 01:16), and night-to-night variability in both duration and start time is elevated (SD ≈ 120 minutes and start-time SD ≈ 103 minutes), which are associated in this dataset with higher CES‑D (small positive correlations). Self-reported lower current happiness (z ≈ -0.53) and modestly elevated perceived stress (PSS = 22) further point toward greater depressive symptom burden.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms: Several objective and behavioral markers suggest protection or lower current symptom severity. Resting heart rate and overall heart-rate mesor are relatively low (RHR ≈ 48 bpm, mesor ≈ 64.9, both z ≈ -1.2), which here are not strongly associated with higher CES‑D and may reflect better cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline autonomic arousal. Circadian rhythm regularity metrics show above-average structure: interdaily stability (z ≈ +0.67) and 24‑hour autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.81) indicate a consistent daily rhythm across recording days—features that are typically associated with lower depressive symptomatology or more stable daily functioning. The participant reports minimal substance use and reports exercising with others about 1–2 times per week (z ≈ +0.53), both of which are behaviors generally associated with lower depressive symptoms. Social activity (1–2 hours socializing) is present at modest levels and may be protective relative to social withdrawal.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean: Balancing the weight of evidence, the strongest single indicators in this dataset (high trait anxiety with a large correlation to CES‑D, low self‑esteem with a large negative correlation, and subjectively disturbed sleep) favor an inference of elevated depressive symptoms relative to the study sample. Objective wearable metrics provide partial countervailing evidence—good circadian regularity and low resting heart rate—that temper the likelihood of very high symptom levels but do not negate the psychosocial signals. Taking these convergent lines together, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with CES‑D scores above the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.31, SD = 9.62). The pattern suggests an elevated but not unambiguously severe level of depressive symptoms (i.e., increased risk relative to peers rather than definitive high-severity classification), though precise placement within the sample distribution cannot be determined without the participant’s actual CES‑D score.

Limitations and uncertainty: This interpretation relies on correlational relationships, group-derived Z-scores, and summary wearable features rather than a contemporaneous CES‑D measurement; therefore it cannot establish a diagnosis or precise score. Some correlations in the dataset are small and several wearable signals are only weakly associated with CES‑D in this sample, so conclusions should be treated as probabilistic. If clinical or research decisions depend on exact depressive symptom severity, direct CES‑D measurement and/or clinical assessment would be necessary."
56543,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptomatology:
Several robust self-report and wearable-derived features point toward an elevated level of depressive symptoms for this participant relative to the study sample. On self-report measures the participant shows high trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86) and elevated perceived stress (PSS = 25, z = 0.92); trait anxiety has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81). Self‑esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 33, z = −0.73) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = −0.71), which also supports greater symptom burden. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05), consistent with sleep disturbance that commonly co-occurs with higher CES‑D scores. Wearable data reinforce these signals: median nightly sleep is relatively short (6 h 26 min, z = −0.94) and sleep onset is markedly late (median start ~02:22), both patterns that are often associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mesor are above the sample mean (RHR = 68 bpm, mesor = 82.3; z ≈ 1.1 for both) and the hourly heart‑rate profile shows pronounced evening/night elevations (e.g., very large positive deviation 10–11 pm, z = 5.94), consistent with sustained evening physiological arousal or later active periods — a pattern that has been observed in affective and stress-related conditions. High daily internet use (reported >4 hours, z = 2.19) and limited in-person exercise with others may further reflect behavioral patterns associated with greater depressive symptom scores in this sample.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower depressive symptomatology:
There are several behavioral and physiological features that temper the above evidence and suggest some protective or neutral elements. The participant reports frequent individual exercise (three or more times per week, z = 1.07), which in this sample correlates weakly in the direction of lower CES‑D. Substance use is minimal (beer, wine/liquor, recreational and non‑prescribed drugs all reported “not at all”), which reduces risk conferred by substance-related behaviors. Health satisfaction is relatively high (score = 5.44, z = 0.88) and is moderately negatively associated with CES‑D (r ≈ −0.39), again a protective indicator. Wearable circadian metrics show moderate interdaily stability (z ≈ 0.67) and only modest intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability z ≈ 0.32), and amplitude is near the group mean; these features indicate that heart‑rate–based circadian organization is present rather than severely flattened or desynchronized. The participant takes almost no naps and engages in structured sedentary hobbies (reading and music) rather than substance‑based coping, which are behavioral patterns that are not strongly associated with higher CES‑D in this dataset.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study population mean:
Weighing both streams of evidence, the balance favors an interpretation of depressive symptom burden above the population mean. The strongest contributors to this inference are the participant’s elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and low self‑esteem, both of which have large correlations with CES‑D in this sample, together with objective and subjective sleep disturbance and late/active evenings with elevated physiological arousal. These combined features make it more likely that the participant’s CES‑D score would be above the study sample mean of 13.3 (SD = 9.62). The presence of protective behaviors (regular solo exercise, low substance use, reasonably preserved circadian stability, and higher health satisfaction) suggests that the symptom level may be moderately elevated rather than extremely high, but the preponderance of anxiety, sleep disturbance, and physiological arousal signals supports classification as above the population mean rather than near or below it.

Notes on uncertainty and next steps:
This synthesis uses correlational signals and group‑level associations to infer relative symptom level; it does not replace a direct CES‑D score or clinical assessment. Given the consistent pattern across multiple modalities (self‑report anxiety/stress, subjective poor sleep, late sleep timing, elevated resting HR and evening arousal), targeted follow‑up — for example administration of the CES‑D (if not already available), a structured clinical interview, and a review of sleep timing/behavioral routines — would help to clarify current depressive symptom severity and guide any recommended interventions."
89142,"Factors in the data that are consistent with relatively higher depressive symptom levels center on self-report measures and several behavioral markers. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66) is meaningfully elevated and this measure has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r = 0.82), making it one of the clearest contributors to elevated depressive symptom risk. Self‑esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) and is strongly negatively correlated with CES‑D (r = -0.71), which likewise points toward greater depressive symptomatology. Subjective affect (current “Happy” rating = 3.0, Z = -0.53; correlation with CES‑D r = -0.46) and very low health satisfaction (score = 1.0, Z = -2.45; correlation r = -0.40) also align with higher depression scores in the study correlations. Objective sleep quantity is reduced (median nocturnal sleep = 5 h 50 min, Z = -1.68), and short sleep duration is commonly associated with elevated depressive symptoms; while the direct correlation here with CES‑D is small, the magnitude of the short sleep and its co-occurrence with the other self‑report risk markers increases the plausibility of elevated depressive symptoms. Low engagement in social/exercise activities (reported “not at all” for exercising alone/with others and sports; negative Z‑scores) and minimal substance use are additional behavioral features that, in this sample, have either weak or small associations with depression but nonetheless are consistent with patterns often seen alongside higher depressive symptoms.

Factors that point toward relatively lower depressive symptom levels are present but generally weaker or more mixed. The participant reports extremely low perceived stress (PSS = 0.0, Z = -5.88), which—given that higher perceived stress in the sample is positively associated with CES‑D (r = 0.29)—would predict lower depressive symptoms. Subjective sleep quality is classified as “Good” on the PSQI (score = 4.0, Z = -1.26), which also favors lower symptomatology. Wearable‑derived circadian regularity metrics show modestly preserved structure: interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.45, Z = 0.33) and intradaily variability is lower than typical (0.44, Z = -0.74), patterns that in this dataset are either weakly or inversely related to CES‑D (correlations near zero to slightly negative). Resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than the sample mean (resting HR = 45.6 bpm, Z = -1.49; MESOR = 60.11, Z = -1.89), which can reflect fitness or lower physiological arousal and are not strongly associated with higher CES‑D in these correlations. These low‑stress, good‑sleep subjective reports and regular circadian markers therefore act as partial counterweights to the stronger risk indicators.

Physiological and temporal activity patterns provide additional context but do not unambiguously tilt the balance. Hourly heart‑rate deviations show a robust nocturnal reduction and clear daytime elevations (largest positive deviations in morning and mid‑late afternoon), and the acrophase of ~3:57 PM indicates a typical afternoon peak. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is modest (0.34, Z = 0.14), suggesting consistent day‑to‑day heart‑rate rhythms. Intradaily variability is relatively low, indicating fewer abrupt shifts in activity across the day. These features reflect preserved circadian structure rather than dysregulation; in the study correlations these rhythm metrics have small or negligible relationships with CES‑D, so they provide limited evidence for elevated symptoms and instead support a picture of maintained physiological daily structure despite other psychosocial risk indicators.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the available evidence, the most heavily weighted predictors in this dataset (trait anxiety with a strong positive correlation with CES‑D; low self‑esteem with a strong negative correlation; low self‑reported happiness and very low health satisfaction) point toward depressive symptom levels that are above the study sample mean CES‑D score (population mean = 13.31). Countervailing signals—very low perceived stress, good subjective sleep quality, and relatively preserved circadian heart‑rate rhythms—mitigate but do not fully offset the influence of the stronger, high‑correlation psychosocial indicators. Therefore the overall pattern is most consistent with CES‑D scores above the population mean, although not all markers are concordant and the exact magnitude cannot be determined from these correlates alone.

Limitations and caveats: these inferences rely on cross‑sectional associations and sample correlations rather than direct measurement of the participant’s CES‑D score, so they should be interpreted as probabilistic indications rather than a diagnostic statement. Several features (e.g., the anomalously low perceived stress score and the combination of low resting HR with short sleep duration) are internally inconsistent and warrant further targeted assessment (e.g., repeat symptom inventories, day‑level sleep diaries, or clinical interview) to resolve ambiguity before any clinical conclusions or interventions."
24898,"Summary of features that align with relatively higher depressive symptom scores: the participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 45, z ≈ 0.37) and reduced global self‑esteem (RSES = 31, z ≈ −1.01); these two self‑report measures have the strongest study‑level correlations with CES‑D in the dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.81; self‑esteem r ≈ −0.71) and therefore are the most important psychological risk indicators present here. Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 6), and objective sleep duration is shorter than the study mean (median sleep 6 h 14 min, z ≈ −1.18), both of which are commonly associated with greater depressive symptoms. Perceived stress is moderately elevated (PSS = 24, z ≈ 0.65), and the participant’s heavy listening to music (reported >4 hours, z ≈ 2.06) shows a positive correlation with CES‑D in the sample (r ≈ 0.25), which may reflect an avoidant or reflective coping pattern that is sometimes seen with higher symptom levels. Taken together, these indices — particularly the combination of higher trait anxiety, lower self‑esteem, disturbed subjective sleep and shorter objective sleep duration — point toward factors that are likely to be associated with above‑average depressive symptomatology.

Summary of features that align with relatively lower depressive symptom scores: the participant shows multiple behavioral and physiological markers associated with resilience or lower symptom burden. Physical activity and sport participation are frequent (exercising alone/with others and sports ≈ three times/week or more; z ≈ +1.1 to +1.6), and these behaviors have small negative correlations with CES‑D in the sample. Social activity is present at moderate levels (socializing ~2–3 hours, z ≈ +0.95). Wearable‑derived circadian and cardiac organization is robust: interdaily stability is high (value 0.65, z ≈ +1.99), intradaily variability is low (value 0.34, z ≈ −1.45), amplitude from cosinor analysis is relatively large (z ≈ +1.64), and sleep start times are consistent (sleep start SD ≈ 34 minutes, z ≈ −1.07). Resting heart rate is comparatively low (49.4 bpm, z ≈ −1.04), which along with strong circadian amplitude suggests good cardiovascular conditioning and well‑structured daily rhythms. These objective patterns — consistent bedtimes, low day‑to‑day variability, pronounced circadian amplitude, and frequent exercise — are all features that tend to protect against higher CES‑D scores or mitigate symptom severity.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the evidence, the strongest single signals that predict higher CES‑D in this sample are elevated trait anxiety and low self‑esteem; both have large study‑level correlations with CES‑D and are clearly present in this participant. Protective features (robust circadian organization, regular sleep timing, frequent exercise, active socializing and relatively high self‑reported happiness) are also well represented and may attenuate risk. On balance, the pattern of strong psychological risk markers combined with mixed but generally protective behavioral and physiological markers suggests the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely above the study population mean but not extreme. In relation to the sample mean CES‑D of 13.31 (SD = 9.62), the data are most consistent with a modestly elevated CES‑D score (i.e., above the population mean but not necessarily far above it), rather than a score near the lowest or highest tails of the distribution.

Caveats and measurement limits: these inferences are probabilistic and based on cross‑sectional associations and aggregated wearable summaries rather than a direct CES‑D score for the participant. Some wearable features have weak sample correlations with CES‑D, and temporally aggregated heart‑rate metrics do not capture within‑day or acute symptom fluctuations. If the goal is to track or intervene on depressive symptoms, concurrent CES‑D measurement and repeated assessment of sleep, anxiety, and self‑esteem would provide stronger, individual‑level evidence."
74413,"Summary and framing
The available data combine self-report measures (trait anxiety, self-esteem, sleep quality, stress, health satisfaction, activity patterns) with wearable-derived physiology (resting heart rate, hourly heart-rate deviations, circadian summary metrics) collected across a semester. Several individual measures show relatively large associations with CES‑D in the study sample (notably trait anxiety and self‑esteem), and those strongly predictive measures point toward relatively fewer depressive symptoms for this participant. Other indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, circadian fragmentation, reduced health satisfaction, lower momentary happiness) point in the opposite direction. Taking the full set of indicators together — and weighting more heavily the measures that have stronger known correlations with CES‑D in this sample — the pattern is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the study population mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.33). This conclusion is probabilistic and tempered by the presence of some risk markers described below.

Features consistent with relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Strong protective trait profile: The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z ≈ −1.02; classified “not anxious”) and high self‑esteem (RSES score reported high, Z ≈ +1.10) are both strongly associated with CES‑D in this sample (STAI–CES‑D r ≈ +0.81; self‑esteem–CES‑D r ≈ −0.71). Low trait anxiety and elevated self‑esteem therefore provide substantial evidence for fewer depressive symptoms relative to peers.  
- Healthy behavioral patterns: Frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more; Z ≈ +1.07) and minimal substance use are behavioral factors that typically relate to lower depression risk. The participant reports limited recreational screen time and modest socializing (1–2 hours), with a tendency toward reading (16–30 minutes; Z ≈ +1.30) rather than passive screen use — patterns that are generally neutral-to-protective.  
- Objective markers of physiological recovery and stability: Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, Z ≈ −0.33), which often reflects good cardiovascular fitness and lower baseline physiological arousal. Median nightly sleep duration is within a healthy range (7 h 34 min, Z ≈ +0.47) and night‑to‑night duration variability is low (SD ≈ 42 minutes, Z ≈ −1.34), both of which tend to be associated with fewer mood symptoms.

Features consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms or residual risk
- Subjective sleep disturbance and late timing: The participant’s PSQI score = 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”) indicates subjective sleep difficulties despite objectively adequate median sleep duration. The median sleep start time is somewhat late (about 00:32), and subjective disturbance can be independently associated with depressive symptoms even when objective duration appears sufficient.  
- Circadian rhythm fragmentation and late‑evening physiological activation: Heart‑rate–derived circadian metrics show elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.76, Z ≈ +1.51), indicating more fragmented within‑day structure of physiological activity — a pattern that has been linked to poorer mood in prior work. In addition, the aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show unusually high deviation in the late evening (10–11 pm deviation = +22.05, Z ≈ +2.46), which suggests elevated physiological arousal late at night and could relate to disturbed sleep onset or evening hyperarousal. Interdaily stability (IS = 0.36, Z ≈ −0.41) is slightly low, consistent with somewhat weaker day‑to‑day regularity. These circadian features constitute objective signals of risk even when mean sleep duration is acceptable.  
- Lower subjective well‑being and health satisfaction: The participant reports lower current happiness (self‑rating 3.0, Z ≈ −0.53) and relatively low health satisfaction (Z ≈ −1.20). Trust scores are modestly low (Z ≈ −0.46). Although stress (PSS = 18, Z ≈ −0.98) is not elevated relative to the study sample, the lower happiness and health satisfaction are relevant risk indicators and correlate modestly with depressive symptoms in this sample (health satisfaction correlation ≈ −0.40).

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement
Weighing the evidence, the strongest individual predictors in this dataset (trait anxiety and self‑esteem) favor lower depressive symptom burden, and objective measures such as sufficient median sleep duration, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, and low substance use further support that interpretation. Countervailing signals — subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), elevated intradaily variability of heart rate (IV Z ≈ +1.51), late‑night physiological activation, and reduced health satisfaction/happiness — indicate residual risk and suggest some subclinical difficulties in sleep timing, circadian regularity, or subjective well‑being that could contribute to mood symptoms if they worsen.

Relative to the study sample mean CES‑D of 13.33, the composite pattern of measures is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the population mean (i.e., fewer symptoms than average in this cohort), while not being uniformly optimal. In short: protective trait factors and healthy behaviors point toward lower-than‑average CES‑D, but circadian fragmentation and subjective sleep/health dissatisfaction are notable areas of risk that warrant attention.

Implications for monitoring and further assessment
Given the mixed signal (clear protective traits but objective circadian fragmentation and subjective sleep disturbance), it would be reasonable to monitor subjective mood and sleep complaints over time and consider targeted strategies that address circadian regularity and sleep timing (for example, consistent sleep–wake timing, evening arousal reduction). If subjective distress or functional impairment emerges or increases, more focused clinical assessment would be indicated."
77789,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of risk and protective signals for depressive symptoms. Self-report indicates elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; Z = 0.17) and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), while objective wearable signals show shortened median nightly sleep (6 h 32 m; Z = -0.80), high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 166 min; Z = 1.49), a late median sleep start (≈ 01:19), a modestly elevated resting heart rate (68.7 bpm; Z = 1.25), and a reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.99). Offsetting these are relatively high momentary happiness (self-report Happy Z = 0.55), above-average interpersonal trust (Z = 0.83), low substance use, strong academic performance, and a pattern of overall circadian stability (interdaily stability Z = 0.67 and relatively low intradaily variability Z = -0.39). Below I summarize the specific signals that point toward higher versus lower depressive symptomatology and then integrate these to characterize the participant relative to the study population mean CES-D (mean = 13.29).

Features that align with relatively higher CES-D scores
- Elevated trait anxiety: The participant’s STAI score (43) is above the sample mean (Z = 0.17). In this dataset STAI shows a strong positive correlation with CES-D (r = 0.81), making anxiety proneness one of the most salient risk indicators for depressive symptoms.  
- Subjective and objective sleep disruption: PSQI > 5 (score = 6) indicates clinically relevant sleep problems. Wearable data show short median sleep duration (6 h 32 m, Z = -0.80), a late sleep onset (median start ≈ 01:19), and large night-to-night variability in sleep length (SD = 166 min, Z = 1.49). Sleep irregularity and short sleep are commonly associated with higher depressive symptom scores; the sleep variability here also correlates positively (r ≈ 0.19) with CES-D in the study sample.  
- Physiologic arousal and blunted daily amplitude: Resting heart rate is elevated (68.7 bpm; Z = 1.25) and MESOR is high (83.16; Z = 1.26)—both positively correlated with CES-D (r ≈ 0.19). Circadian amplitude is below average (amplitude Z = -0.99), which is consistent with a blunted daily rhythm; reduced amplitude has been linked to greater depressive symptom burden in prior work and in this dataset shows a modest negative association with wellbeing.  
- Lower health satisfaction and low physical social activity: Health satisfaction is relatively low (Z = -0.86) and the participant reports minimal exercise (especially with others) and little involvement in sports or group exercise. Lower perceived health and low social/physical activity are modestly associated with higher CES-D in the sample (correlations in the expected direction).

Features that align with relatively lower CES-D scores
- Relatively preserved self-regard and positive affect: The participant’s self‑esteem score (RSES = 36) is in the upper range of the scale and, although slightly below this sample’s mean (Z = -0.31), higher self-esteem is strongly negatively correlated with CES-D in this dataset (r = -0.71), suggesting a meaningful protective factor. Momentary self-reported happiness is above average (Z = 0.55; correlation with CES-D r = -0.46), another important buffer against depressive symptoms.  
- Social trust and low substance use: Interpersonal trust is above average (Z = 0.83) and substance/recreational drug use is minimal; trust and low substance use are associated with lower CES-D (trust r = -0.41 in the sample), which supports resilience.  
- Circadian regularity and low fragmentation: Interdaily stability is moderately high (Z = 0.67) and intradaily variability is below average (Z = -0.39), indicating a reasonably regular day-to-day rhythm and limited within-day fragmentation—patterns that are typically protective or neutral with respect to depressive symptoms.  
- Low perceived stress relative to the sample and academic functioning: The Perceived Stress score is lower than the sample mean (PSS Z = -0.44), and the participant’s academic performance is excellent; both factors generally predict lower depressive symptom burden or resilience.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean CES-D
Weighing the evidence, the participant shows a mixed profile. Prominent risk indicators are elevated trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance combined with objectively short and highly variable sleep, an elevated resting heart rate, and reduced circadian amplitude. These features are directly or indirectly linked to higher CES‑D in this sample (notably the very strong STAI–CES-D association). In contrast, robust protective elements—relatively high self-esteem, above-average momentary happiness, high interpersonal trust, minimal substance use, circadian regularity, and low perceived stress relative to peers—counterbalance those risks.

Because the strongest single statistical link in this dataset is between trait anxiety and CES-D (r = 0.81) and because the participant’s anxiety is above average, the net risk is nontrivial; however, several sizable protective signals (notably self-esteem and positive affect) temper that risk. On balance, the most defensible position is that the participant’s inferred depressive symptom level is near the study population mean and may be modestly above it rather than well below or far above. In plain terms: the participant’s profile does not sit at the low end of CES-D scores in this sample, and there are credible indicators that would push symptom burden upward, but there are also clear and meaningful protective factors that likely prevent markedly elevated CES-D relative to peers.

Uncertainty and interpretation bounds
This synthesis integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable metrics and relies on sample correlations to guide interpretation; it cannot definitively assign a CES-D score. Signals with the strongest inferential weight here are trait anxiety (high predictive correlation) and sleep disruption (consistent objective and subjective indicators). Other features carry smaller or mixed associations and therefore contribute less to certainty."
88882,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of signals, but the strongest and most strongly weighted indicators point toward depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean (population mean CES‑D = 13.34). Key self‑report measures that have the largest known correlations with CES‑D are strongly protective in this case (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, and high self‑reported current happiness). Physiological and behavioral signals show some features that could elevate risk (short sleep, late sleep timing, and modest circadian irregularities), but these signals have weaker study correlations with CES‑D and are of smaller effect size compared with the protective self‑report indicators.

Evidence indicating relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Self‑report measures with the strongest links to CES‑D are favorable. Trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = −1.31) is well below the sample mean and STAI has a large positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.81), so this low score strongly suggests lower depressive symptomatology. Self‑esteem is high (RSES Z = +1.1; correlation with CES‑D r ≈ −0.71), again a substantial protective factor. Current happiness (score = 5.0, Z = +1.64; r ≈ −0.46) and relatively low perceived stress (PSS Z ≈ −0.98) further support lower depressive symptoms. 
- Objective physiology consistent with lower risk: resting heart rate is low (47.35 bpm, Z = −1.28), and the MESOR of heart rate is lower than the sample mean (MESOR Z = −1.22). In this sample higher RHR/MESOR has a modest positive correlation with CES‑D (r ≈ 0.19), so the participant’s low cardiovascular baseline is consistent with reduced risk or greater fitness, which tends to be protective.

Evidence indicating relatively higher depressive symptoms or risk
- Sleep duration and timing patterns are potential risk signals. Median nightly sleep is short (5 h 57 min, Z = −1.53) and the median sleep start time is quite late (≈ 2:34 AM). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) is in the range classified as disturbed sleep. Although in this dataset sleep duration and some sleep metrics have weak correlations with CES‑D, short and late sleep are clinical behaviors that can be associated with mood disturbance and thus represent a relevant risk domain here.
- Circadian/behavioral rhythm metrics show some irregularity: interdaily stability is below average (0.34, Z = −0.57) and intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.63, Z = +0.60). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = −0.78). These findings indicate less robust 24‑hour structure and somewhat greater within‑day fragmentation of heart‑rate patterns. In the study correlations these circadian measures have only small associations with CES‑D, so their contribution to inferred depressive symptoms is modest, but they align with the observed late and short sleep pattern.
- Nighttime/late‑evening physiological arousal: aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show elevated HR relative to the mesor around late evening and very early night (e.g., 12–2 AM and 7–9 PM windows have relatively large positive deviations; 1–2 AM is an extreme positive outlier, Z ≈ +3.1). Elevated heart rate during hours typically associated with sleep could indicate late-night activity or physiological arousal that may impair sleep continuity. Correlations of these hourly deviations with CES‑D are small in this sample, so interpret these as suggestive rather than determinative.

Weighing evidence and overall comparison to the population mean
- The most heavily weighted and highly correlated predictors of CES‑D in this dataset (STAI, Rosenberg self‑esteem, and current happiness) all point toward lower depressive symptoms for this participant. Physiological markers of fitness (low resting HR and low MESOR) provide additional, though smaller, protective signal. Countervailing signals (short sleep duration, late sleep timing, some circadian irregularity, and episodic elevated late‑night heart rate) are present but have smaller effect sizes and weaker correlations with CES‑D in this sample.
- On balance, the integrated evidence indicates the participant’s depressive symptom level is likely below the study sample mean CES‑D score of 13.34 (i.e., “below the population mean”). This conclusion rests primarily on strong protective self‑report indicators (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, high current happiness) augmented by objective signs of cardiovascular fitness. The sleep timing/duration and circadian irregularity are notable risk domains that temper the conclusion and warrant monitoring because they can contribute to mood disturbance even when other risk markers are low.

Limitations and caveats
- Many physiological/circadian features are aggregated across days and have small correlations with CES‑D in this sample; these findings should be considered supportive/contextual rather than definitive. Correlations reported are associative and do not establish causation. Finally, the strongest predictors in this dataset are self‑reported constructs that may reflect current coping and strengths; changes in sleep or daily rhythm could nevertheless influence symptoms over time."
19245,"Indicators consistent with relatively higher depressive symptoms are prominent in the self-report profile. The participant reports high trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35; STAI–CES-D correlation = +0.81), elevated perceived stress (PSS = 27, Z = +1.47; corr = +0.28), low momentary happiness (Current Happy = 2, Z = −1.61; corr = −0.46), low interpersonal trust (2.17, Z = −2.07; corr = −0.41), and modestly reduced self-esteem (RSES = 35, Z = −0.45; corr = −0.71). These measures have moderate-to-strong correlations with CES-D in the sample (especially trait anxiety and self-esteem), and together they form a consistent psychological signal that aligns with higher depressive symptom burden. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) and elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps = 0.27, Z = +2.27; corr = +0.20) also point toward sleep disruption patterns that commonly co-occur with elevated depressive symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep timing and circadian metrics add behavioral corroboration of risk. Median sleep start time is very late (02:38 AM) with high night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 155 minutes, Z = +1.23; sleep start time SD Z = +0.92). Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms is below the study mean (0.31, Z = −0.82), indicating a relatively irregular daily schedule. The heart-rate aggregation shows unusually elevated evening/night heart-rate deviations relative to the mesor (notably 10–11 pm deviation = +20.73, Z = +2.25 and 11–12 pm = +16.74, Z = +1.98; midnight 12–1 am deviation = +9.6, Z = +1.63) alongside large negative deviations overnight consistent with sleep. Late, irregular sleep timing and evening physiological arousal are behavioral/physiological patterns often associated with poorer mood and higher depressive symptom scores.

There are also features that argue against a uniformly high depressive symptom profile and that may buffer risk. The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z = +1.07; corr with CES-D = −0.09) and moderate social time with friends (2–3 hours daily; Z = +0.95), both of which are typically protective or associated with lower depressive symptoms (correlations in this sample are small but in the expected direction). Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 6 m, Z = +1.14), which can be protective or may reflect hypersomnia depending on context, and resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than average (Resting HR = 49.6 bpm, Z = −1.02; MESOR = 66.42, Z = −1.03), which may reflect higher cardiovascular fitness rather than pathology. Academic performance (GPA) is high, which suggests preserved cognitive/functional capacity in academic domains.

Weighing the evidence: several of the strongest and most directly CES-D–related signals in this profile point toward greater depressive symptomatology (notably high trait anxiety with a large sample correlation to CES-D, low self-esteem, low momentary happiness, elevated perceived stress, disturbed subjective sleep, late/irregular sleep timing, and evening physiological arousal). Protective signals (regular exercise, social time, long average sleep duration, low resting HR, strong academic performance) are present but generally carry smaller correlations with CES-D in the sample or are less definitive in their interpretation. On balance, the multimodal pattern is most consistent with a level of depressive symptoms above the study population mean. Using the study’s reference distribution (population CES-D mean = 13.27), the data collectively suggest the participant’s CES-D score is more likely to be above the population mean rather than near or below it.

Interpretive caveats: correlations cited are sample associations and do not establish causation; single-time self-report measures and aggregated wearable metrics can reflect situational factors (e.g., semester timing, illness, medications, exercise regimen) that influence physiology and mood. The pattern warrants clinical attention to anxiety, sleep timing/regularity, and mood symptoms, but these observations should be integrated with direct CES-D score, clinical interview, and longitudinal follow-up for firm conclusions."
83748,"Summary synthesis
Across self-report and wearable domains the participant shows a mixed but overall favorable profile with respect to depressive symptomatology. Trait and state self-report measures that most strongly predict depressive symptoms in this sample (STAI trait and Rosenberg self‑esteem) are in the direction associated with fewer depressive symptoms: STAI is very low (score 24, Z = -1.71; STAI–CES-D correlation = +0.82) and self‑esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = +1.52; RSES–CES-D correlation = -0.71). Current happiness is elevated (Z = +1.64; corr = -0.46), perceived stress is below the sample mean (PSS Z = -0.71; corr = +0.28), and habitual exercise is substantially above the sample mean (exercise Zs ≈ +1.1 to +1.6; exercise–CES-D correlations small-to-moderate negative). Several objective physiology and sleep features are also consistent with lower depressive symptomatology (resting heart rate and mesor are below sample mean, circadian amplitude and intraday variability are near average, consistent nightly sleep start time with few naps). Taken in total, these higher‑weight indicators (strong correlations and large z‑scores) point toward depressive symptom levels below the study sample mean.

Factors that, in this dataset, point toward relatively higher depressive symptoms
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The PSQI score is 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”), which is above common clinical cutoffs for sleep problems and is a known correlate of depressive symptoms. Though sleep duration is only modestly below average (median 6 h 54 min, Z = -0.35), the participant reports poorer subjective sleep quality, which could elevate symptom burden even when objective sleep timing is fairly consistent.  
- Low socializing time: The participant reports very little time socializing with friends (15 minutes or less; Z = -2.20). While the provided correlation between this specific item and CES‑D is near zero in the sample, low social contact is conceptually and clinically relevant as a potential risk or maintenance factor for depressive symptoms and therefore warrants consideration.  
- Isolated circadian/physiologic signals: A few aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show unusually large positive Z‑scores in the evening and around midnight (e.g., 6–7pm Z = +2.67; 11–12am Z = +3.51). Although the correlations of these hourly deviations with CES‑D are small in this sample, elevated late‑evening arousal could reflect evening activity or late arousal that may contribute to subjective sleep disturbance for some individuals.

Factors that point toward relatively lower depressive symptoms
- Low anxiety proneness and high self‑esteem: The participant’s very low STAI trait (Z = -1.71) and high Rosenberg self‑esteem (Z = +1.52) are among the strongest predictors in this dataset and both point toward fewer depressive symptoms (given the observed STAI–CES‑D correlation +0.82 and RSES–CES‑D correlation -0.71). These are high‑weight indicators in the sample for lower CES‑D.  
- Positive affect and low perceived stress: Elevated current happiness (Z = +1.64) and lower perceived stress (PSS Z = -0.71) further support lower depressive symptom burden. These measures have nontrivial correlations with CES‑D in the expected directions (happiness negative, stress positive).  
- Healthy lifestyle and objective physiology: Frequent exercise (Zs > +1), minimal substance use, a relatively low resting heart rate (55.3 bpm, Z = -0.34), stable sleep start timing (sleep start SD Z = -0.93), and absence of naps (Z = -0.86) are all consistent with behavioral and physiological patterns that tend to co‑occur with lower depressive symptoms in this sample. Circadian summary metrics (interdaily stability, intradaily variability, amplitude) are near the sample mean and do not present a pattern strongly associated with higher CES‑D.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study sample mean
Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most highly weighted indicators (very low trait anxiety, relatively high self‑esteem, elevated current happiness, regular exercise, and favorable resting physiology) consistently point toward a level of depressive symptoms below the study sample mean. The participant does have some features that could elevate symptom risk—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), very limited socializing, and some late‑evening heart‑rate elevation—but these are either weaker predictors in the sample (small correlations) or contradictory (objective regularity in sleep timing, low naps). Given the relative magnitudes of z‑scores and the high predictive correlations of anxiety and self‑esteem with CES‑D in this dataset, the combined multimodal profile is most consistent with depressive symptom levels below the population mean CES‑D score of 13.32. In summary: the balance of evidence indicates a likely CES‑D level below the sample mean, though pockets of sleep disturbance and social isolation merit monitoring in context."
63347,"Factors in the dataset that align with higher depressive symptom levels center primarily on elevated trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, reduced health satisfaction, and low engagement in physical and social activities. The participant’s STAI–Trait score is 45 (z ≈ 0.37), and STAI has a strong positive correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = 0.81), making it a particularly salient risk-related indicator. Subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 7; z ≈ 0.13), and sleep-pattern irregularity is present (sleep duration SD = 151 minutes, z ≈ 1.14), both of which show modest positive correlations with CES‑D in the sample. Self-reported health satisfaction is relatively low (3.22; z ≈ −0.78) and correlates negatively with mood (r = −0.39), consistent with higher depressive symptoms when health satisfaction is lower. Behavioral indicators such as essentially no reported exercise (large negative z-scores for exercised alone/with others) and limited socializing (social time 16–30 minutes; z ≈ −1.41) are also consistent with risk for higher CES‑D, even though the direct correlations with CES‑D are modest.

Balancing those risk indicators are several features that point away from elevated depressive symptoms. The participant’s self-esteem score is at the maximum of the Rosenberg scale (40; z ≈ 0.26), and self-esteem has a strong inverse correlation with CES‑D in this sample (r = −0.71), representing a substantial protective factor. Current self-reported happiness is relatively high (4.0; z ≈ 0.55) and interpersonal trust is above average (3.5; z ≈ 0.5), each negatively associated with CES‑D in the sample. Wearable-derived physiological patterns also provide protective signals: indices of circadian regularity are relatively strong (interdaily stability = 0.48, z ≈ 0.58; autocorrelation at 24 h z ≈ 0.98) and intradaily variability is low (IV = 0.35, z ≈ −1.38), indicating a relatively consolidated, regular daily rhythm. Higher amplitude and a clear evening acrophase (peak HR ~5:43 PM; amplitude z ≈ 1.69) along with elevated evening cardiovascular activity (large positive aggregate deviations in the evening hours) are associated here with either neutral or slightly negative correlations with CES‑D, suggesting intact behavioral activation in the evening rather than the blunted diurnal activity pattern often seen with more severe depressive presentations.

The wearable sleep and physiological profile provides mixed information that requires integrated interpretation. Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 49 min; z ≈ −0.46) and sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 01:28), both of which can contribute to mood symptoms; however, naps are infrequent (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07) and resting heart rate is modest (56.9 bpm; z ≈ −0.15). The combination of high mesor (mean circadian HR; 82.2, z ≈ 1.13) and high amplitude (z ≈ 1.69) indicates a relatively pronounced daily HR rhythm rather than a flattened pattern. Sleep timing variability (SD of start ≈ 80 minutes) is not highly elevated (z ≈ −0.06), but high variability in duration (SD = 151 min) suggests inconsistent sleep quantity, which aligns with the subjective PSQI disturbance and modest positive correlations between sleep variability and CES‑D in the sample.

Weighing all available evidence, the participant’s profile contains both notable risk factors for elevated depressive symptoms (pronounced trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, low health satisfaction, and minimal exercise/socializing) and substantial protective factors (very high self‑esteem, relatively high current happiness, consolidated circadian physiology, and preserved evening physiological activation). Given the balance and the magnitudes of associations observed in this sample—especially the very strong sample-level relationship between anxiety and CES‑D but also the strong inverse relationship of self‑esteem with CES‑D—the most defensible inference is that the participant’s overall depressive symptom level is near the study sample mean and could be somewhat above it. In other words, relative to the study population mean CES‑D of 13.31 (SD = 9.62; median = 11.0), the data point toward a symptom level approximately near the mean, with some evidence (notably elevated trait anxiety and sleep disturbance) that it may be modestly elevated above average. This conclusion should be considered probabilistic: direct CES‑D score data for this participant were not provided here, and the mixed indicators warrant cautious interpretation and, if clinically relevant, targeted follow-up focused on anxiety, sleep stabilization, and engagement in physical and social activities."
