44869,"Summary and overall inference:
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the profile shows a mixture of protective and risk-related features, but the balance of salient signals—elevated depressive symptoms, disturbed subjective sleep, high resting heart rate and increased circadian fragmentation—more strongly aligns with greater perceived stress than with low stress. Taking the available evidence together, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is above the population mean PSS score (population mean = 21.62). This conclusion is based on multiple converging indicators described below while noting that several protective features (high self-esteem, low substance use) temper interpretation.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress:
- Depressive symptom burden is elevated (CES-D = 22; z ≈ 0.9), a metric that shows a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28). Elevated depressive symptoms commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress and are an important psychological correlate in this case.  
- Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10; z ≈ 1.52, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating substantial reported sleep problems despite long median sleep duration. Poor PSQI is commonly associated with greater perceived stress.  
- Wearable cardiovascular markers indicate physiologic arousal: resting heart rate is high (78.4 bpm; z ≈ 2.41) and MESOR is elevated (z ≈ 1.97). Elevated baseline heart rate is consistent with greater autonomic activation and, in the study sample, shows a small positive association with PSS.  
- Circadian/behavioral rhythm metrics show signs of disruption: intradaily variability (a measure of within-day fragmentation) is elevated (z ≈ 1.16), and variability in sleep timing and duration is substantial (sleep duration SD z ≈ 2.09; sleep start time SD z ≈ 1.63). These instability and fragmentation metrics correlate modestly with higher PSS in the sample and align with behavioral patterns commonly seen with elevated stress.  
- Daily behavioral patterns include a very high amount of sedentary hobby time (more than 4 hours; z ≈ 3.19) and low frequency of exercise. These lifestyle patterns are not directly large correlates in the sample but are plausibly related to lower resilience and higher perceived stress in context with the other risk signals.  
- Current self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (score 3.0; z ≈ -0.53), which is consistent with elevated subjective stress.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress:
- Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI-Trait = 39; z ≈ -0.23), indicating the participant does not endorse particularly high chronic anxiety proneness relative to the sample; this is a potential protective factor.  
- Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40; z ≈ 0.26), which is negatively correlated with PSS in the sample and can buffer against perceived stress.  
- Substance use is minimal (no beer, wine/liquor, or recreational/non-prescribed drug use), a behavior that generally reduces one set of risk exposures for stress-related problems.  
- The median sleep duration is long (median 8 hours 26 minutes; z ≈ 1.55), which could be protective in terms of sleep quantity even though subjective sleep quality is poor—long sleep may reflect compensatory behaviors or time in bed but does not by itself indicate good restorative sleep.  
- Health satisfaction is somewhat above average (score 5/7; z ≈ 0.55), which provides an additional, though modest, resilience indicator.

Physiological/circadian integration and nuances:
- Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal dip and afternoon/evening relative rises, with an acrophase near early evening (≈5:09 PM). The presence of a nocturnal nadir is typical, but the elevated MESOR and resting heart rate indicate the baseline around which these fluctuations occur is higher than the study sample. High intradaily variability alongside a relatively low amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -0.91) suggests a pattern of blunted day–night contrast combined with frequent short-term variability—this combination is often observed with stress, poor sleep, and irregular routines.  
- Several physiological correlations with PSS are small-to-moderate (e.g., resting HR r ≈ 0.14; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), so wearable signals support but do not definitively prove high perceived stress on their own. Similarly, some hourly deviations have modest correlations with PSS; these should be interpreted as corroborating rather than decisive.

Balanced conclusion and caveats:
The participant displays multiple convergent signals associated with higher perceived stress—elevated depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep quality, high resting heart rate and MESOR, and circadian fragmentation—outweighing the protective indicators (high self-esteem, low substance use, relatively normal trait anxiety). On balance, the data are most consistent with perceived stress above the study population mean. This inference acknowledges moderate effect sizes and modest correlations in several metrics; causal direction cannot be determined from these cross-sectional and aggregated data. Where available, objective wearable measures and subjective reports are integrated to provide a coherent picture, but temporal or situational context (e.g., academic deadlines) could further clarify fluctuations in stress that are not captured here."
92552,"Summary overview: The multimodal profile shows a combination of psychological trait scores, subjective sleep disturbance, and a delayed, irregular circadian/behavioral pattern on wearable measures. Trait anxiety (STAI) and depressive symptom scores (CES-D) are elevated relative to the sample mean (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37; CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18) and both have positive correlations with PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.31 and r ≈ 0.28 respectively). Subjective sleep quality is also poor (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59, classified as disturbed sleep), and several wearable-derived rhythm metrics indicate irregular timing and intra-day fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.59, Z = 0.32; sleep duration SD = 174 minutes, Z = 1.66). Taken together, these features point toward greater perceived stress than average, although physiological indicators of baseline autonomic tone and some positive self-report indices temper that interpretation.

Features that align with relatively higher perceived stress: Elevated trait anxiety and modest depressive symptoms (STAI and CES-D, both positively correlated with PSS) and self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI > 5) are the clearest psychosocial signals that would predict higher PSS. Objective sleep timing and regularity reinforce that risk: the participant’s median sleep start time is very late (≈ 03:48 AM) and night-to-night sleep timing and duration show high variability (sleep start SD ≈ 94 minutes; sleep duration SD ≈ 174 minutes). Wearable circadian metrics consistent with dysregulated daily structure—higher intradaily variability (Z = 0.32, correlation with PSS ≈ 0.16) and only modest interdaily stability (Z = -0.24)—are also associated in the study with higher perceived stress. Evening/night elevations in heart rate (notably large positive deviations from the mesor between midnight and 3 AM, with Z-scores > 2.0–4.0) coupled with an acrophase around 8:48 PM indicate atypical timing of physiological arousal relative to the typical population pattern; late/evening arousal and fragmented sleep timing are commonly linked to greater subjective stress and poorer sleep quality.

Features that align with relatively lower perceived stress or that may buffer stress: Several indicators suggest resilience or lower physiological arousal. The participant reports relatively higher self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.82) and above-average momentary happiness (Z = 0.55), both of which in this sample are negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.15 and r ≈ -0.19), suggesting some psychological protection. Objective cardiovascular baseline measures are low: a low mesor (63 bpm, Z = -1.49) and low resting heart rate (48.8 bpm, Z = -1.11) are consistent with lower tonic sympathetic activation or higher cardiovascular fitness; these features can moderate stress reactivity or reflect better physical conditioning. Median nightly sleep duration is, on average, adequate (≈ 7 h 49 min, Z = 0.79), so despite late timing and variability the participant typically obtains normative total sleep time—this could blunt the degree to which irregular timing translates into functional impairment.

Physiological circadian pattern and behavioral timing interpretation: The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations show pronounced elevation in late night/early morning hours (peak deviations around 1–3 AM) and marked reductions through late morning and midday (negative deviations ~ -15 to -20 bpm). This pattern, together with a late median sleep onset (~03:48 AM) and an acrophase in the evening (20:48), describes a delayed activity/rest schedule with concentrated physiological activation later in the day and some nocturnal arousal. The participant’s interdaily stability is slightly below the cohort mean and intradaily variability is above the mean, indicating relatively less regular daily structure and more fragmented activity/rest transitions. These circadian features are modestly associated with higher PSS in the study and provide an objective correlate to the self-reported disturbed sleep and late sleep onset.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the profile contains multiple signals that predict higher perceived stress (elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, higher intradaily variability, and evening/night physiological arousal). Countervailing signals (higher self-esteem and happiness, low resting heart rate, and adequate median sleep duration) argue against very high perceived stress and suggest some resilience. On net, the participant’s pattern is most consistent with perceived stress somewhat above the study population mean but not extreme; given the moderate effect sizes and mixed protective factors, the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best described as above the population mean (population PSS mean = 21.62) but likely within one standard deviation of that mean rather than at a high outlier level. This conclusion is probabilistic and constrained by the modest correlations observed in the sample and the absence of a measured PSS score for this individual."
73158,"Summary of factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
Multiple self-report indicators point toward lower perceived stress compared with the study sample. The participant reports essentially no depressive or trait-anxiety symptoms (CES‑D = 0, Z = −1.38; STAI‑Trait = 24, Z = −1.71), high self‑esteem (Rosenberg score; Z = +1.66), and above‑average momentary happiness (Z = +1.64). Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, Z = −1.26), alcohol and drug use are absent, and academic performance is high. Physiological markers align with these protective signs: resting heart rate (48.2 bpm, Z = −1.18) and MESOR (mean circadian heart rate; Z = −1.10) are low relative to the sample, and intradaily variability of the heart‑rate rhythm is also below the sample mean (Z = −0.74). These patterns—low self‑reported mood/anxiety symptoms, good subjective sleep, low resting HR, and less fragmented circadian cardiac activity—collectively suggest a lower level of perceived stress.

Factors that could indicate relatively higher perceived stress or situational arousal:
There are several wearable-derived signals that could reflect elevated physiological arousal at specific times. The participant shows pronounced positive heart‑rate deviations in the early morning and mid‑morning windows (notably 5–6am Z = +3.10 and 6–7am Z = +4.41), and these hourly deviations have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.21–0.23 for the early morning hours). Shorter median nocturnal sleep duration (6 h 11 min; Z = −1.25) is another potential stress‑related vulnerability, even though subjective sleep quality is rated as good. Sleep‑start variability is modest but non‑negligible (SD = 67 minutes). Thus, while global trait measures are low, the combination of reduced sleep time and elevated morning cardiovascular activation suggests periods of physiological arousal that are associated in the sample with higher perceived stress.

Circadian rhythm and hourly heart‑rate profile interpretation:
Circadian summary metrics indicate an overall structured rhythm but not especially strong stability: interdaily stability is near the sample mean (IS = 0.39, Z = −0.16) and 24‑hour autocorrelation is slightly below average (Z = −0.11). Intradaily variability is lower than average, consistent with relatively low fragmentation of daily activity. The acrophase around 1:01 PM and an amplitude close to the cohort mean suggest a typical timing and magnitude of daily cardiac rhythm. The participant’s pronounced nocturnal heart‑rate dip (large negative deviations overnight, Zs around −2 to −2.7) combined with large positive morning deviations indicates a strong night‑to‑morning contrast: deep relative cardiovascular quiescence overnight and brisk morning activation. This pattern is physiologically normal and often reflects fitness and consolidated sleep, but the strong morning peaks—given their positive correlation with PSS in the sample—are a specific physiological feature to monitor as a potential marker of situational stress or early‑morning arousal.

Behavioral, social, and lifestyle context:
The participant reports frequent group exercise (exercising with others three times/week or more, Z = +1.23), no substance use, and limited solitary sedentary hobbies; these behaviors generally align with lower stress and better social support. Time spent socializing is modest but present. The participant reports minimal recreational drug or alcohol use and good health satisfaction. Together these lifestyle features support resilience to perceived stress. However, relatively low engagement in some individual recreational activities (e.g., reading, listening to music) may reduce opportunities for solitary stress‑reduction behaviors, which could interact with the morning arousal pattern described above.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean:
Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of indicators (very low depressive and trait‑anxiety self‑report scores, high self‑esteem and happiness, low resting heart rate, good subjective sleep quality, frequent group exercise, and limited substance use) point to an overall perceived stress level that is below the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). That is, the participant is likely to be below the population mean for perceived stress. This inference is tempered by the presence of shorter nocturnal sleep duration and marked morning cardiovascular activation—features that are associated in the sample with higher PSS and which could reflect episodic or context‑dependent arousal. Practical monitoring or follow‑up that would clarify risk would focus on nightly sleep duration and consistency and on whether morning heart‑rate peaks are tied to predictable demands (e.g., early classes, intense morning exercise) versus generalized anxiety or sleep disruption."
45963,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows several converging signals consistent with elevated perceived stress, particularly high trait anxiety (STAI trait = 62, Z = 2.05) and elevated depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 22, Z = 0.9). Wearable-derived physiology and circadian measures further indicate a relatively elevated cardiovascular baseline (resting heart rate = 68.2 bpm, Z = 1.2; MESOR = 81.8, Z = 1.07) together with reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude = 4.2, Z = −2.13) and poor stability of daily rhythms (interdaily stability = 0.16, Z = −2.06). Taken together with subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7) and highly variable sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:56; start-time SD = 215 min, Z = 2.89), the pattern is more consistent with above-average perceived stress in this study sample.

Features indicating higher perceived stress: Several strong trait and symptom indicators point toward higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety is markedly elevated (STAI Z = 2.05) and has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), making it a salient predictor. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) are above the sample mean (Z = 0.9) and also correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28). Low self-esteem (RSES score 30, Z = −1.15) and low self-reported happiness (current happy = 2.0, Z = −1.61) are additional psychological features that usually accompany higher perceived stress. Physiologically, an elevated resting heart rate and MESOR (Z ≈ 1.2 and 1.07) indicate a raised cardiovascular baseline that, in this sample, is modestly positively associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.13). Circadian measures that reflect irregularity—particularly very low interdaily stability (Z = −2.06), low amplitude (Z = −2.13), and large variability in sleep onset (start-time SD Z = 2.89)—are also consistent with stress-related disruption of daily structure; amplitude and stability metrics in this dataset are negatively associated with PSS (lower amplitude/stability → higher perceived stress).

Features indicating lower perceived stress or mitigating factors: There are several behavioral and performance indicators that temper the magnitude of the stress signal. Academic performance is strong (GPAs consistently high), which may reflect effective functioning despite elevated internal distress. Substance and recreational drug use are low (no reported non-prescribed drug use; beer infrequent; wine modest), reducing contributions of substance-related stressors. Some social and physical activity are present (socializing ~1–2 hours, exercising with others 1–2 times/week), which are behaviors generally associated with stress buffering; these items do not show strong correlations with PSS in the sample. Sleep quantity is not severely reduced on average (median sleep duration ~6 h 40 min, Z = −0.64), and daytime napping is minimal, suggesting the participant is not chronically hypersomnolent. These positive behaviors and preserved academic functioning argue against extreme levels of perceived stress.

Sleep and circadian detail that nuance the profile: Although median sleep duration is only modestly below the sample mean, sleep timing is late (median start ~01:56) and highly inconsistent across days (start-time SD Z = 2.89). The cosinor-derived acrophase (~4:11 PM) together with a low amplitude suggests blunted, late-shifted circadian rhythmicity. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show elevated heart rate during late-night and midday hours (e.g., 12–1am and 12–1pm peaks) and large negative deviations in the early morning; these patterns, combined with overall low interdaily stability and reduced amplitude, point to dysregulated timing of physiological arousal rather than a simple uniformly elevated arousal across the day. In this dataset, such circadian irregularity and low amplitude are associated with higher PSS (amplitude r ≈ −0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ −0.11).

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample mean: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level above the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.61). Key drivers of this inference are markedly elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 2.05), elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 0.9), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), physiological indications of an elevated cardiovascular baseline (resting HR and MESOR Z > 1), and pronounced circadian irregularity (interdaily stability and amplitude Z < −2). Factors that mitigate this conclusion (good academic performance, limited substance use, some social/exercise engagement) reduce the probability of extreme stress but do not outweigh the convergent psychological and physiological indicators pointing toward above-average perceived stress in this sample."
22138,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of risk and protective features with respect to perceived stress. Prominent risk indicators include elevated trait anxiety (STAI trait = 50; Z = 0.86) and modest depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 15), both of which correlate positively with PSS in the sample. Behavioral markers that align with greater perceived stress include variable sleep timing (median sleep start 01:15 AM with a high SD of 121 minutes) and greater evening/online engagement (internet use and moderate weekly alcohol use). Physiological data present a nuanced picture: resting heart rate and heart-rate mesor are modestly above the sample mean (resting HR = 60.6, mesor = 77.5; Z ≈ 0.3–0.5), and some wearable-derived correlations (small positive coefficients) point toward modest associations between higher cardiac activation and higher perceived stress. Taken together, these elements support an inference of stress levels that are at least somewhat elevated relative to the sample average.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress: The strongest single signal favoring higher perceived stress is the relatively high trait anxiety (STAI), which has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31). Related self-report signals include lower momentary happiness (current happiness Z ≈ −0.53) and a CES-D score that, while below clinical thresholds for depression, is positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28). Sleep-timing irregularity (large standard deviation of sleep start times) is another behavioral risk factor—variability in sleep timing shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the cohort and can reflect circadian desynchrony that tends to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Wearable physiology gives additional, albeit modest, support: slightly elevated resting HR and mesor values and small positive correlations between reduced nocturnal heart-rate reductions at some hours and PSS suggest some sympathetic predominance or reduced overnight recovery in participants with higher perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress: Several features indicate resilience or lower stress burden. The participant reports generally adequate sleep duration (median 7 h 32 min; Z ≈ 0.43) and a favorable PSQI score at the threshold of “good sleep” (PSQI = 5; Z ≈ −0.8), and naps are absent. Wearable circadian features point to reasonable rhythm structure: interdaily stability is above average (Z ≈ 0.5) and amplitude is relatively high (Z ≈ 0.73), both of which in this sample tend to be associated with lower PSS (amplitude correlation r ≈ −0.17, interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12). Nocturnal heart-rate dips are pronounced (large negative deviations from the mesor overnight), which is physiologically consistent with intact nighttime recovery. Protective lifestyle elements include frequent social exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more; Z ≈ 1.23) and time spent reading (Z ≈ 1.3), activities that correlate weakly or negatively with PSS in the sample.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68): Balancing the above evidence, the participant’s profile is best characterized as near to, but modestly above, the population PSS mean. The relatively high trait anxiety and modest depressive symptoms are the most salient drivers pushing inferred perceived stress upward; these are only partly counterbalanced by generally adequate sleep duration, robust circadian amplitude and nocturnal cardiac recovery, and some protective social/exercise behaviors. In practical terms this pattern suggests a level of perceived stress slightly above the study average rather than a markedly elevated or clearly below-average position.

Caveats: Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in this dataset are generally small to moderate; wearable-derived features and self-reports measure related but distinct constructs and cannot by themselves determine a PSS score. The inference above should be interpreted as probabilistic and relative to the study sample, not as a clinical diagnosis."
31439,"Overall summary
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed profile with several signals that typically accompany elevated perceived stress but also with features that suggest behavioral regularity and some protective resources. On affective and trait measures the participant has moderately elevated anxiety-proneness (STAI trait = 49, Z = 0.76) and a modest elevation in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28); both of those scales have positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28). Objectively, cardiovascular markers are notable: resting heart rate (78.2 bpm) and MESOR (91.4) are substantially above the study mean (Z = 2.38 for both), indicating a higher baseline physiological activation. Subjective sleep quality is also in a range commonly associated with stress (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed sleep), and median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 41 min, Z = -0.61) with relatively large night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 110 minutes, Z = 0.22). Taken together, these features point toward a level of perceived stress that is likely above the study population mean.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher perceived stress
- Emotional/trait indicators: The STAI trait score (49, Z = 0.76) and CES-D score (16, Z = 0.28) are both above the sample mean and have positive correlations with PSS in this cohort, supporting an inference of greater perceived stress. Self-reported current happiness is below average (3.0, Z = -0.53), which also aligns with higher stress in this sample (happiness r ≈ -0.19 with PSS).  
- Sleep and sleep-related subjective distress: PSQI > 5 (score = 6) indicates subjectively disturbed sleep, a known correlate of higher perceived stress; median sleep duration under seven hours and measurable night-to-night variability further increase vulnerability to stress-related effects.  
- Physiological arousal: Resting heart rate and MESOR are both markedly elevated (Z = 2.38), consistent with higher sympathetic tone or reduced parasympathetic recovery; these cardiovascular elevations have a small positive correlation with PSS (resting HR r ≈ 0.14). The hourly aggregate heart-rate pattern shows clear daytime elevations (e.g., morning and late-afternoon peaks) and robust nocturnal declines; elevated baseline cardiac values make those daytime peaks occur from a higher starting point, which can reflect sustained physiological load.  
- Lifestyle/behavioral contributors: Infrequent exercise (mostly 1–2 times per week, limited sports) and moderate weekly alcohol use (beer/wine/liquor 1–2×/week; Z ≈ 1.0) are behavioral patterns that, in this sample, are either neutral or weakly associated with higher PSS and may not provide strong stress-buffering effects.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower perceived stress (protective or mitigating factors)
- Circadian regularity and within-day stability: Circadian metrics indicate a relatively regular daily structure — interdaily stability is slightly above average (value = 0.44, Z = 0.25) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (value = 0.40, Z = 0.64). Intradaily variability (0.37, Z = -1.24) is lower than the sample mean, meaning fewer abrupt transitions within the day. Those features (stable day-to-day rhythm and lower fragmentation) are generally associated with better resilience to stressors and are negatively or weakly related to PSS in this dataset.  
- Behavioral supports: The participant reports moderate socializing (about 1–2 hours daily, near average) and near-ceiling self-esteem (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11), a trait that correlates inversely with PSS here (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15). Low use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs and very infrequent napping (rare naps) are lifestyle features that reduce some common stress-related risks. Time spent on solitary, low-arousal activities (reading, watching media) may also function as habitual coping.  
- Sleep timing regularity: Median sleep start time is around 00:39 with a moderate start-time SD (67 minutes, Z = -0.35), indicating a reasonably consistent sleep phase even if overall duration is modest; consistency in timing can protect circadian alignment and mood.

Synthesis and overall inference relative to the study population
Balancing the evidence, physiological and affective signals (notably the markedly elevated resting heart rate/MESOR, elevated trait anxiety, and disturbed subjective sleep) weigh strongly toward an inference of greater perceived stress compared with the study sample. Protective signals — especially the relative regularity of daily rhythms (interdaily stability and high 24-hour autocorrelation), low intradaily fragmentation, high self-esteem, and limited drug use — mitigate but do not fully counterbalance the physiological and symptom elevations. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level above the population mean PSS (study mean = 21.61). This conclusion is based on converging psychometric (STAI, CES-D, PSQI), behavioral (sleep duration, exercise frequency), and physiological (resting HR, MESOR) indicators; any single measure alone would be insufficient, but the pattern across modalities supports an above-mean inferred stress level.

Caveats
This is an interpretive synthesis, not a clinical diagnosis. Correlations reported in the dataset are informative but modest in size; some protective and risk indicators have small or mixed associations with PSS in this sample. The inference that perceived stress is “above the population mean” should be treated as probabilistic and contingent on the provided measures rather than definitive."
46558,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile presents a mixture of signals relevant to perceived stress. Self-report measures show a modest elevation in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, z ≈ 0.38) alongside relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 37, z ≈ −0.43) and comparatively high self-esteem (RSES = 35, z ≈ −0.45) and happiness (current happiness z ≈ 1.64). Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a fairly regular daily structure (interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation both above the sample mean, z ≈ 0.8 and 0.73 respectively) with a typical daytime acrophase (≈5:17 PM) and a resting heart rate modestly above average (60.7 bpm, z ≈ 0.3). Sleep quantity and regularity are broadly unremarkable: median nightly sleep ≈7 h 5 min (z ≈ −0.12), low night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 58 min, z ≈ −0.98), and a borderline-good PSQI (score = 5, z ≈ −0.8).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The most direct survey indicator pointing toward greater perceived stress is the elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D), which in this sample correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28). Resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14) and is slightly above the sample mean, which can reflect modestly increased physiological arousal. Intradaily variability (a measure of fragmentation in activity/heart-rate patterns) is elevated relative to the sample mean (z ≈ 0.32) and shows a small positive association with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), consistent with links between rhythm fragmentation and stress. Behavioral habits that could be permissive of stress exposure include very low physical activity/sports frequency and substantial sedentary leisure (notably high video-game use and a sedentary hobby), which are not strongly correlated with PSS in this dataset but are often associated with poorer stress coping in broader literature.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several features point toward lower perceived stress. The participant reports higher subjective well‑being and resources (high happiness score, elevated self‑esteem, good health satisfaction), all of which correlate negatively (or weakly) with PSS in the sample and are protective factors against perceived stress. Circadian regularity markers—interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation—are substantially above average (z ≈ 0.8 and 0.73) and correlate negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.12 to −0.17), suggesting a stable daily routine that is associated with lower perceived stress. Objective sleep metrics show sufficient median sleep duration and low variability, and the PSQI indicates generally acceptable subjective sleep quality; both sleep regularity and adequacy tend to support lower perceived stress. Substance use is minimal and social time is moderate, both of which align with lower stress exposure in this sample.

Integrated conclusion relative to the sample mean PSS: Taking the pattern of measures together—moderately elevated depressive symptoms and small signs of physiological arousal on one hand, and clear protective signals from positive affect, self‑esteem, circadian regularity, and generally adequate sleep on the other—the balance of evidence suggests an overall perceived stress level that is likely near the study population mean (population PSS mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68). There are specific indicators (CES-D, slight resting‑HR elevation, intradaily variability) that could push perceived stress above the mean for this individual at times, but the strong regularity of daily rhythms and higher subjective well‑being argue against a marked elevation in PSS relative to peers.

Clinical/research implications: Monitor depressive symptom change over time and consider the potential benefits of increasing regular physical activity and earlier sleep timing to strengthen resilience. If the goal is to refine the inferred PSS level, obtaining the participant’s direct PSS score or repeated PSS assessments would reduce uncertainty and help determine whether the modest risk signals identified here correspond to sustained elevated perceived stress."
93699,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable domains, the participant shows a mixed pattern of indicators. Several features point toward elevated perceived stress (greater PSS) — notably disturbed subjective sleep, elevated trait anxiety, late and somewhat irregular sleep timing, high evening/late-night internet use, and modestly elevated cardiovascular activity — while other features (low depressive symptom score, evidence of a stable day-to-day circadian pattern, limited substance use, regular social/exercise contacts, and steady academic performance) point toward lower perceived stress. Taking the balance of evidence together, the participant’s data are most consistent with a perceived stress level above the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.64), though not extreme on most measures.

Indicators consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The participant’s PSQI is 9 (z ≈ +1.05) indicating clinically meaningful sleep problems. Poor subjective sleep quality is a well-established correlate of greater perceived stress and of PSS in this dataset.
- Trait anxiety and related affect: The STAI–Trait score is 44 (z ≈ +0.27, classified as “anxious”), and trait anxiety here correlates positively with PSS in the sample. Lower self-rated happiness and lower health satisfaction (health satisfaction z ≈ −1.11) further align with stress-linked negative affect.
- Late and variable sleep timing with modestly shortened sleep: Wearable sleep shows median nightly sleep of about 6 h 51 min (z ≈ −0.42) and a median sleep start near 00:59, with sleep-onset timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 89 minutes). Later, shorter, and more variable sleep are commonly associated with greater perceived stress and with daytime difficulty.
- High nocturnal/late-evening arousal and behavioral patterns: Internet usage >4 hours (z ≈ +2.19) and elevated evening screen-based leisure time may exacerbate late sleep and stress. Resting heart rate (64.8 bpm, z ≈ +0.79) and an elevated mesor (mean circadian HR ≈ 79.4, z ≈ +0.74) suggest a modestly higher baseline cardiovascular activation, which is positively associated (albeit weakly) with PSS in this sample.

Indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Low depressive symptoms and moderate functioning: CES-D score is low (8; z ≈ −0.55; classification “not depressed”), and academic performance (GPA around 3.4) is solid. Lower depressive symptom burden and maintained academic functioning reduce the likelihood of very high PSS.
- Day-to-day circadian regularity and rhythm structure: Nonparametric circadian measures show relatively high interdaily stability (0.51; z ≈ +0.83) and good 24-hour autocorrelation (0.42; z ≈ +0.81), indicating that the participant’s heart-rate–based daily rhythm is fairly consistent across days. In this sample, greater interdaily stability tends to associate with lower PSS; that pattern suggests some protective regularity.
- Limited problematic substance use and low daytime napping: The participant reports little or no recreational/nonprescribed drug use and moderate alcohol use; wearable nap data show essentially no daily naps (z ≈ −0.86). These behavioral factors reduce likelihood of substance-related stress influences.
- Social/exercise engagement and circadian amplitude: The participant reports exercising with others 1–2 times per week (z ≈ +0.53) and a modest circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ +0.14), both of which can be stress-mitigating relative to highly sedentary or arrhythmic profiles.

Physiological circadian and hourly heart-rate pattern interpretation:
- The cosinor-derived measures and hourly aggregate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough in heart rate and a daytime peak in the afternoon (acrophase ~4:00 PM). The overnight deviations are strongly negative (e.g., −16 to −18 bpm around 4–7am) and daytime deviations positive (peaking ~12–1pm and mid-afternoon). This pattern indicates preserved diurnal modulation of cardiac activity rather than blunted or flattened rhythm. Preserved interdaily structure (high autocorrelation and interdaily stability) suggests the participant generally keeps a regular daily pattern even though sleep timing is delayed.
- The combination of a modestly elevated resting heart rate and a relatively regular rhythm suggests sustained low-to-moderate autonomic activation rather than episodic extremes. Correlations between some circadian metrics and PSS in the sample are small, so these physiological measures should be interpreted as contributory rather than determinative.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study mean:
- Considering the converging indicators (notably elevated PSQI, trait anxiety, late/insufficient sleep, high evening internet use, and modestly elevated resting HR) alongside protective signals (low depressive symptoms, intact academic performance, and preserved day-to-day circadian regularity), the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with perceived stress that is above the sample mean PSS (population mean 21.64). The elevation is likely modest to moderate rather than extreme. This conclusion recognizes that some stress-relevant correlates (e.g., trait anxiety, sleep disturbance) are more pronounced than others, and that some objective markers (circadian stability, lack of depression) counterbalance those signals.
- Caveats: many individual correlations with PSS in the dataset are modest; causal direction cannot be inferred from cross-sectional associations; and self-report and wearable signals sometimes diverge (e.g., subjective sleep problems despite preserved circadian rhythm). Therefore this interpretation should be treated as probabilistic rather than definitive.

If desired, next analytic steps could include (a) estimating a numeric PSS prediction using a weighted model of the strongest predictors (PSQI, STAI, resting HR, sleep timing/variability), (b) examining temporal relations between high internet-use evenings and subsequent sleep/HR changes, and (c) comparing weekday versus weekend patterns to better understand schedule-driven stressors."
84011,"Overview: The multimodal profile presents a mixture of risk and protective features for perceived stress. Trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27), subjective sleep quality is classified as disturbed (PSQI = 6), and circadian fragmentation by wearable metrics is relatively high (intradaily variability Z = 1.02). At the same time, objective sleep duration is longer than the sample average (median 8 h 28 min, Z = 1.59), resting heart rate and mesor are lower than the sample average (RHR = 51.4 bpm, Z = -0.80; mesor = 63.1 bpm, Z = -1.48), and the participant reports regular participation in team/partner exercise and sports. Taken together, these pieces of evidence point to a mix of physiological signs of good cardiovascular fitness and behavioral sleep sufficiency alongside subjective and circadian signatures that are commonly associated with increased perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress: Several measures align with patterns that tend to accompany higher PSS scores. The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 44) is above the study mean and has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), indicating a disposition toward anxiety proneness that often co-occurs with elevated perceived stress. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) also maps onto stress-related complaints even though objective sleep duration is long; the discrepancy between long wearable-measured sleep and self-reported disturbed sleep can reflect sleep fragmentation, nonrestorative sleep, or heightened sleep-related worry—each linked to higher perceived stress. Wearable circadian metrics show elevated intradaily variability (Z = 1.02) and reduced interdaily stability (Z = -0.49), a pattern of within-day fragmentation and somewhat less regular day-to-day timing; intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample, and such fragmentation is frequently associated with worse stress and mood outcomes. Finally, modest reductions in self-esteem (Rosenberg = 33, Z = -0.73) and relatively low self-reported trust in others (Z = -0.78) are psychosocial factors that can increase vulnerability to feeling stressed.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress: Multiple behavioral and physiological indicators point toward lower perceived stress or protective resources. Objectively, the participant has a long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 28 min, Z = 1.59) with no recorded naps and a relatively stable sleep timing (median start ≈ 00:03, sleep start SD ≈ 82 min), which are generally associated with better restorative capacity. Resting heart rate and mesor are substantially below the sample mean (RHR Z = -0.80; mesor Z = -1.48), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic sympathetic arousal, factors that are typically protective against chronic perceived stress. The participant reports frequent group exercise and sports (exercise with others and sports both Z > 1), low substance use, high academic performance (GPA values high), and moderate-to-high self-reported health satisfaction and happiness (health satisfaction Z = 0.55; happiness Z = 0.55) — all of which are associated in this sample with lower PSS or reflect resources that buffer stress.

Integrative interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the profile shows co-occurring stress risk markers (elevated trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, circadian fragmentation, lower self-esteem/trust) and robust protective markers (long objective sleep duration, low resting heart rate/mesor, frequent exercise, high functioning academically and in self-rated health/happiness). Given the moderate strength of the trait-anxiety signal and the objective circadian fragmentation combined with subjective sleep complaints, the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is likely slightly above the study sample mean rather than markedly elevated. Concretely, relative to the population mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), the multimodal profile is most consistent with a PSS placement that is near to but modestly above the population mean.

Caveats and practical implications: This inference integrates cross-sectional survey scores and aggregate wearable summaries; it does not replace a direct PSS score and cannot capture transient situational stressors. The discrepancy between objectively long sleep and reported sleep disturbance, together with circadian fragmentation, warrants attention because it signals a potential mismatch between physiological rest and subjective recovery — a common pathway to elevated perceived stress. If the research aim is to predict or intervene on perceived stress, the strongest actionable targets in this profile would be addressing subjective sleep quality and circadian regularity (timing consistency and within-day activity structure), while leveraging existing protective behaviors (regular group exercise and low substance use)."
88008,"Overall summary: The participant’s multimodal profile is mixed, with several self-report measures indicating elevated negative affect and anxiety while wearable-derived behavioral and circadian metrics suggest relatively stable daily structure and healthful habits that would be expected to buffer stress. Self-report scores show moderate elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 20, Z ≈ 0.7) and trait anxiety (STAI = 48, Z ≈ 0.66), coupled with below-average self-esteem (RSES Z ≈ -0.73) and modestly lower current happiness and health satisfaction. These psychological indicators are positively correlated with PSS in the sample (CES-D and STAI correlations ≈ 0.28–0.31), so they point toward increased perceived stress. At the same time, behavioral data indicate frequent exercise (sports and solo exercise three times per week or more), minimal substance use, and substantial engagement in reading—behaviors that are typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are the most salient contributors in this dataset. Both STAI and CES-D are above the sample mean (Z ≈ +0.66–0.70) and have moderate positive correlations with PSS within the study, implying that this participant’s internalizing symptoms likely drive higher stress appraisal. Lower self-esteem and lower self-reported happiness (both modestly below the sample mean) further support a tendency toward greater perceived stress. Objective sleep duration is relatively short (median 6 h 9 min, Z ≈ -1.29), which can exacerbate stress reactivity and reduce emotion regulation capacity even if subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z ≈ -0.8) is rated as acceptable; short sleep duration has a weaker direct correlation with PSS in this sample, but it remains a potential physiological stress vulnerability.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Multiple wearable and behavioral indices suggest resilience or buffering against stress. The participant’s circadian heart-rate rhythm is strong and regular: interdaily stability is above average (0.52, Z ≈ +0.91), amplitude is relatively high (15.36, Z ≈ +1.48), intradaily variability is low (0.30, Z ≈ -1.73), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is higher than average (Z ≈ +0.73). These features indicate consistent day-to-day structure and low fragmentation, attributes that correlate with lower PSS in the study (interdaily stability and amplitude correlations ≈ -0.12 to -0.16). Behavioral health habits that are protective—regular exercise (high frequency), low substance use, and low daily napping—further support lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.1 bpm, Z ≈ -0.36), which typically tracks with better cardiovascular fitness and may be associated with lower stress physiology.

Sleep and circadian interpretation: The subjective sleep quality score (PSQI = 5) places the participant at or just within the range commonly considered acceptable, and the wearer-derived sleep timing and regularity support a relatively stable sleep-wake schedule (median sleep start ~01:14 AM with moderate start-time variability). However, total sleep time is shorter than the study average (median ~6 h 9 min) and sleep duration variability is moderately low, suggesting consistent but truncated sleep. This pattern (short but regular sleep) can produce mixed effects: the circadian robustness and low fragmentation are protective, but the shorter nightly duration could incrementally increase perceived stress and reduce recovery over time.

Physiological and daily pattern interpretation: Hourly heart-rate deviations show a large nocturnal nadir and pronounced afternoon–evening rises (acrophase ~5:06 PM; large positive deviations 7–9 PM), consistent with robust circadian amplitude and evening activity. These heart-rate features align with the wearable circadian metrics and indicate predictable daily arousal cycles rather than dysregulated physiological activation. Small correlations between evening heart‑rate deviations and lower PSS in the sample suggest that the participant’s pattern of concentrated daytime/evening activity may not be a major driver of heightened perceived stress.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68): Balancing the evidence, the participant shows moderate psychosocial risk factors for elevated perceived stress (notably trait anxiety and depressive symptoms) but also displays multiple behavioral and physiological buffers (regular exercise, low substance use, strong and stable circadian rhythms, and low intradaily variability). Taken together, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near to modestly above the study population mean rather than markedly higher or substantially lower. In other words, the profile leans slightly toward “above the population mean” PSS, but the strength of circadian regularity and health behaviors likely attenuates what might otherwise be a larger elevation. The confidence of this inference is moderate given the available correlational evidence and the absence of the participant’s direct PSS score in the provided materials."
83566,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mixture of physiological regularity and behavioral/psychological indicators that together point toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Self-report measures reveal marked elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 37, Z = 2.47) and trait anxiety (STAI = 62, Z = 2.05), low self-reported happiness (current = 2.0, Z = -1.61) and below-average self-esteem (RSES = 29, Z = -1.29). Wearable-derived physiology shows an elevated resting heart rate (69.4 bpm, Z = 1.34) and a high mesor (84.83, Z = 1.49). Subjective sleep quality is impaired (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59), although objective sleep duration is relatively long (median 8 h 8 min, Z = 1.18). Taken together, these convergent signals of mood disturbance, anxiety proneness, poorer subjective sleep, and higher basal cardiac tone are the most salient indicators relevant to perceived stress.

Features consistent with greater perceived stress: The strongest stress-related signals come from the symptom measures—large positive Z-scores on depression and trait anxiety are strongly associated with higher PSS in this sample (CES-D and STAI correlations with PSS ~0.28–0.31). Low self-reported happiness and reduced self-esteem further align with that pattern. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI >5) despite objectively longer sleep suggests poor restorative sleep quality, a pattern commonly seen with elevated stress. Physiologically, the elevated resting heart rate and high mesor indicate higher tonic cardiovascular activation across the recording period; modest positive correlations of these metrics with PSS in the study support interpreting them as stress-related. The participant’s late median sleep start time (about 01:52 AM) may also reflect circadian misalignment or evening arousal that can be associated with greater perceived stress and mood symptoms.

Features consistent with lower perceived stress (protective or mitigating): Several wearable-derived and behavioral features could buffer perceived stress or indicate maintained behavioral structure. Sleep duration is longer than the cohort mean (median ~8 h), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD ~65 min, Z = -0.82), which can support recovery even when subjective quality is poor. Circadian regularity measures are not markedly disrupted: interdaily stability is near the cohort mean (0.42, Z = 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (Z = 0.90), indicating a consistent day-to-day rhythm in heart-rate patterns. The participant reports no recreational substance use and no daily naps, and academic performance (GPAs 3.5–3.67) is strong; these behavioral indicators and preserved daily structure can act as protective factors against stress-related functional decline.

Circadian and hourly physiology interpretation: Heart-rate cosinor parameters show a clear diurnal pattern with an acrophase in the late afternoon (approximately 4:51 PM) and moderate amplitude, while hourly aggregate deviations show expected overnight heart-rate suppression and daytime elevations. Intradaily variability is slightly above average (0.58, Z = 0.24), consistent with some within-day fragmentation of activity/physiological arousal; this metric has a small positive correlation with PSS in the cohort. Overall, the wearable-derived circadian profile is characterized by a reliable 24-hour structure but with elevated tonic cardiac values and modest within-day variability—an ensemble compatible with sustained sympathetic/physiological activation in the context of generally preserved daily routines.

Holistic conclusion relative to the sample mean: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s high and clinically notable scores for depressive symptoms and trait anxiety—together with low happiness and elevated resting heart rate—provide strong support for inferring a perceived stress level above the study population mean (population PSS mean = 21.61). Protective signs (long but subjectively poor sleep, regular day-to-day rhythms, no substance use, stable academic performance) moderate but do not outweigh the large affective and physiological indicators pointing toward elevated stress. Limitations: this inference synthesizes cross-sectional survey and aggregated wearable data rather than an actual PSS score for the individual, and correlations supplied are modest; causal direction cannot be established."
87032,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of psychosocial risk factors and some protective behaviors. Self-report measures indicate elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 28, Z = +1.53) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = +0.27). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = +1.52) and self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are below the study mean. Wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics show reduced day-to-day rhythm regularity (low interdaily stability, low 24-hour autocorrelation) together with increased within-day fragmentation (high intradaily variability) and a higher average cardiac level (MESOR and resting heart rate both elevated). Taken together, these patterns point to stress-related psychological and physiological activation that is more pronounced than typical for the study sample.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several relatively strong indicators align with greater perceived stress. Self-report depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = +1.53) and trait anxiety (STAI correlation with PSS r ≈ 0.31) are positively associated with PSS in the sample and are elevated in this participant, which is a primary psychological risk signal. Subjective sleep disturbance is substantial (PSQI Z = +1.52) and sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep start ≈ 02:00 with high start-time SD, Z = +1.36), both features that commonly co-occur with and amplify perceived stress. Wearable circadian measures show low interdaily stability (Z = −1.15) and very low 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = −1.87) alongside high intradaily variability (Z = +1.44); this pattern—fragmented, irregular daily structure—has been linked to poorer stress-related outcomes and corresponds with the participant’s elevated MESOR (Z = +1.56) and higher-than-average resting heart rate (69.4 bpm, Z = +1.34), suggesting sustained physiological arousal. Several of these physiological features (resting HR and MESOR) are positively correlated with PSS in the sample (small-to-moderate correlations), supporting their relevance to perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: There are also data points that argue against extreme perceived stress. The participant reports minimal substance use (alcohol and recreational drugs below the sample mean), which reduces a behavioral contributor to stress and health risk. Academic performance (GPA ~3.44–3.5 across terms) is in the above-average range, which may reflect functional capacity and effective coping in academic domains. Self-esteem is not low in absolute terms (Rosenberg = 36/40, Z ≈ −0.31) and its correlation with PSS is modest and negative, providing a small protective effect. The participant engages in some social activity (socializing 1–2 hours) and spends time in sedentary leisure pursuits (listening to music, reading) that could serve as coping or recovery behaviors; these activities show weak or mixed correlations with PSS in the sample.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study mean PSS: Balancing the evidence, the most salient and weighty indicators—elevated depressive symptom burden, significant subjective sleep disturbance with late and irregular sleep timing, and objective markers of circadian irregularity and higher mean cardiac activity—point toward a level of perceived stress above the study population mean. The magnitude of several z-scores (CES-D ≈ +1.5, PSQI ≈ +1.5, MESOR ≈ +1.6, intradaily variability ≈ +1.4) and the direction of sample correlations (notably STAI and CES-D with PSS) support this interpretation. Protective signals (low substance use, adequate academic performance, relatively preserved self-esteem) moderate but do not outweigh the risk pattern. Therefore, based on the combined self-report and wearable data, the participant’s inferred perceived stress is likely above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.6). This inference is probabilistic and should be considered alongside direct PSS measurement and longitudinal context when available."
94641,"Summary and overall comparison
Taken together, the multimodal data point to a pattern of elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Several strong self-report indicators of emotional distress (CES-D = 29, z = 1.63; STAI–Trait = 54, z = 1.25) and multiple behavioral and physiological signals that commonly co-occur with higher stress (shorter, more variable sleep; elevated resting heart rate) outweigh a smaller set of protective features. Relative to the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.61), the aggregate profile is best characterized as above the population mean for perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Affect and trait symptom measures: The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29, z = 1.63) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 54, z = 1.25). Both of these scales are positively correlated with PSS in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so these scores are among the strongest indicators of higher perceived stress in the dataset.  
- Subjective and objective sleep disturbance: The participant’s PSQI score is high (PSQI = 10, z = 1.52), indicating poor subjective sleep quality. Wearable-derived sleep shows a relatively short median nightly duration (6 h 15 min, z = -1.15) combined with high night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 168 minutes, z = 1.52). Sleep variability is positively associated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.14), and short/irregular sleep commonly accompanies higher stress. The participant also naps frequently (mean naps/day = 0.3, z = 2.66), which may reflect compensatory sleep behavior.  
- Cardiovascular arousal and circadian dampening: Resting heart rate is elevated (70.3 bpm, z = 1.44), and resting HR is positively correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14), consistent with greater physiological arousal. Cosinor-derived amplitude is lower than average (amplitude z = -0.47); lower amplitude of heart-rate circadian rhythm is associated with higher PSS in the sample (amplitude r ≈ -0.17, i.e., higher amplitude → lower PSS), suggesting a relatively dampened diurnal rhythm that can accompany stress.  
- Low social and physical activity: Self-report shows very low socializing (15 minutes or less, z = -2.2) and minimal exercise (exercised alone z = -1.93; exercised with others z = -1.58). High sedentary hobby time (z = 3.19) and low health satisfaction (z = -1.61) further align with behavioral patterns that frequently co-occur with greater perceived stress and reduced coping resources.  
- Convergent pattern across modalities: The combination of elevated internalizing symptoms, poor subjective sleep, objective short and inconsistent sleep, higher resting heart rate, and low social/physical activity provides convergent evidence that the participant’s perceived stress is above the study mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress (protective or contrary signals)
- Circadian regularity metrics: Interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.42, z ≈ 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is higher than average (autocorrelation z = 1.15). In this sample, higher 24-hour autocorrelation and greater regularity are associated with lower PSS (autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17), so this participant’s relatively high 24-h autocorrelation could be a protective factor, indicating reasonably consistent day-to-day timing of heart-rate patterns. Intradaily variability is somewhat lower than average (IV z = -0.53), which can indicate less fragmentation in daily activity and is not suggestive of extreme rhythm disruption.  
- Behavioral harm-minimization: The participant reports no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use (z-scores for substance use all below the sample mean), which reduces exposure to substance-related stressors or coping behaviors that sometimes exacerbate perceived stress.  
- Some positive self-report: Self-reported current happiness is slightly above the study mean (happy z = 0.55), which, given its negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.19), may modestly buffer perceived stress. Listening to music and certain solitary recreation (e.g., videogaming, listening to music) are relatively high and could reflect emotion-regulation strategies that have short-term stress-relief effects for some individuals.

Integration and holistic interpretation
On balance, the data show stronger and more numerous indicators that tend to align with higher perceived stress than with lower perceived stress. The most compelling contributors to an above-mean PSS inference are elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores (CES-D and STAI), poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI), objectively shortened and variable nocturnal sleep, and an elevated resting heart rate. These items are not isolated; they form a coherent pattern across self-report and wearable-derived measures. Countervailing signals — notably a relatively high 24-hour autocorrelation and low intradaily fragmentation, abstinence from substances, and somewhat elevated self-reported happiness — are relevant and may represent protective or compensatory factors, but they do not fully offset the weight of indicators pointing toward elevated stress. Therefore, the overall inference is that the participant’s perceived stress level is above the study population mean.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation
- Correlations reported in the dataset are modest in magnitude; individual measures should be interpreted in the context of the whole multimodal profile rather than in isolation.  
- Wearable circadian and heart-rate metrics are aggregated across days and indicate typical patterns rather than situational fluctuations; they provide complementary physiological context but do not replace direct PSS measurement.  
- If a precise clinical or intervention decision is being considered, targeted follow-up (direct PSS score, brief clinical interview, or sleep-focused assessment) would reduce uncertainty and help prioritize supports (sleep regularity, social engagement, behavioral activation, or monitoring of cardiovascular signs)."
82728,"Summary and overall inference:
Taken together, the multimodal data paint a mixed but coherent picture in which several robust behavioral and physiological markers point toward relatively well-regulated daily rhythms and health-promoting habits, while subjective sleep quality and some indices of reduced positive affect point toward mild stress-related strain. Balancing these findings, the profile is most consistent with an overall perceived stress level that is near to slightly below the study population mean (population PSS mean = 21.61). This conclusion rests on the combination of objective circadian regularity and protective lifestyle behaviors that typically associate with lower perceived stress, offset modestly by disturbed subjective sleep and reduced self-reported happiness.

Factors consistent with higher perceived stress:
- Subjective sleep problems: The participant’s PSQI score is 7 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), indicating clinically meaningful problems with sleep quality despite a median wearable-recorded sleep duration just under 7 hours. Sleep start times are late (median start ≈ 01:05 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability (start-time SD ≈ 93 minutes), which often co-occurs with higher perceived stress and poorer daytime functioning. The PSQI Z-score is slightly positive while sleep-duration Z is slightly negative, supporting a mismatch between quantity and perceived quality.  
- Lower positive affect and health satisfaction: Self-reported happiness (Z ≈ -0.53) and health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.45) are below the sample mean; these reductions in positive affect and satisfaction have small negative correlations with lower well-being and can accompany higher perceived stress even when anxiety and depressive symptom scores are not elevated.  
- Some early-morning physiological associations: Several early-morning hourly heart-rate deviations show small positive correlations with PSS (notably around 3–6 AM, correlations ≈ 0.19–0.21), which could reflect subtle arousal or autonomic patterns that align with higher perceived stress in a subset of individuals.

Factors consistent with lower perceived stress:
- Strong circadian structure and robust activity rhythms: Multiple wearable circadian metrics indicate well-organized daily physiology—interdaily stability is above average (IS Z ≈ 0.75), autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (Z ≈ 1.06), and amplitude is notably elevated (amplitude Z ≈ 1.54). These objective rhythm features (and their negative correlations with PSS in the sample) typically associate with better stress regulation and lower perceived stress.  
- Low physiological baseline arousal and healthy resting heart rate: Resting heart rate (≈60.2 bpm; Z ≈ 0.24) and a clear diurnal heart-rate profile with expected nocturnal reductions indicate a normative cardiovascular set point and preserved nocturnal downregulation—features generally aligned with lower chronic stress.  
- Health-promoting behaviors and functioning: The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone three or more times weekly; exercise Z ≈ 1.07) and minimal use of alcohol, recreational, or non-prescribed drugs (Z-scores strongly negative). Academic performance is high (consistent 4.0 GPAs). These behavioral patterns are protective and commonly linked to reduced perceived stress.  
- Low reported anxiety and depressive symptoms: Trait anxiety (STAI score 39, Z ≈ -0.23) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11, Z ≈ -0.24) are below sample averages, and self-esteem is high (score 37), all of which argue against substantially elevated perceived stress for this individual.

Holistic synthesis and comparative statement:
When weighing risk and protective signals, the objective circadian robustness and health behaviors are influential protective indicators that outweigh the modest signals of stress from sleep disturbance and reduced positive affect. Therefore, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s perceived stress level is close to, and likely slightly below, the study sample mean PSS (21.61). In other words: not substantially elevated relative to peers, but with specific domains—sleep quality and positive affect—where targeted improvement could further lower perceived stress.

Limitations and caveats:
This inference relies on cross-sectional and aggregated wearable features and self-report measures; correlations are associative and not causal. The heart-rate hourly values are temporally aggregated and cannot speak to acute day-to-day stressors. Finally, individual PSS was not provided here, so conclusions are inferential and should be interpreted in context of the full dataset and, where possible, direct PSS scores and longitudinal observations."
45076,"Summary: The data present a mixed profile of psychosocial risk and resilience for perceived stress. Key self-report indicators include modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) and mild depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18), together with a subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6, above the common clinical cutpoint). Objective wearable measures show a generally sufficient sleep duration (median 7 h 38 min, Z = 0.56) but decreased day-to-day circadian regularity (interdaily stability = 0.32, Z = -0.74) and somewhat increased within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.59, Z = 0.32). Protective features include relatively high self‑esteem (Z = 1.38), frequent exercise (Z > 1.0 for several exercise items), low resting heart rate (57.8 bpm), low substance use, and generally good academic performance. Taken together, these elements point toward a perceived stress level that is near the sample mean PSS score of 21.6, with a leaning toward being slightly above the mean given the anxiety/sleep signals.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety and mood: The participant’s STAI trait anxiety is modestly elevated (44; Z = 0.27) and CES‑D depressive symptoms are slightly above average (15; Z = 0.18). Both instruments show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28), so these elevation(s) favor higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and variability: PSQI = 6 indicates clinically meaningful sleep complaints; subjective sleep disturbance tends to associate with higher PSS in the literature and in this dataset. Although objective sleep duration is adequate, sleep start time is late (median ~00:57) and there is nontrivial night-to-night variability in sleep timing (SD ≈ 63 minutes), both of which can worsen perceived stress or reduce sleep restorative value.
- Circadian irregularity and physiological signs of arousal: Interdaily stability is lower than the sample mean (Z = -0.74), indicating weaker day-to-day structure in heart‑rate rhythms, while intradaily variability is mildly elevated (Z = 0.32), indicating fragmentation of activity/physiology across days. Several early-morning heart-rate deviations (approximately 3–7 AM) show positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), which may reflect nocturnal/early-morning physiological arousal associated with stress or worry for some participants.
- Reduced subjective well‑being: Lower recent happiness (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95) are additional small signals that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Strong psychosocial and behavioral resources: The participant reports high self‑esteem (Z = 1.38) and frequent exercise (multiple exercise items Z > 1.0), both of which correlate with lower PSS in the sample (self‑esteem r ≈ -0.16; sports/exercise correlations small to negative). High trust (Z = 0.83) and moderate social time (1–2 hours socializing) also suggest social resources that buffer stress.
- Healthy physiological baseline and sleep quantity: Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.8 bpm, Z ≈ -0.04) and median nightly sleep duration is above the sample mean (7 h 38 min, Z = 0.56), both of which are generally associated with lower perceived stress or greater physiological resilience. Low BMI and low daytime napping further support an overall healthy behavioral profile.
- Low substance use and adaptive leisure: Minimal recreational drug use and low alcohol consumption, along with engagement in sports and limited problematic screen time, are behaviors typically associated with better stress outcomes.

Wearable circadian and hourly heart‑rate patterns (interpretive points)
- The heart-rate cosinor parameters show a modestly lower mesor (mean level) and reduced amplitude relative to the sample (mesor Z = -0.49; amplitude Z = -0.44), consistent with lower daytime/greater nighttime separation of cardiovascular tone but weaker overall circadian amplitude. Acrophase at ~4:14 PM places the daily heart‑rate peak in the late afternoon.
- Aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced positive departures from the mesor in the mid-to-late afternoon (peaks ~3–5 PM) and strong negative deviations at night (large drops around 2–6 AM). Some of the early-morning negative deviations have small positive correlations with PSS, suggesting that atypical early morning arousal patterns relate to greater perceived stress in this sample. However, many of the larger daytime HR deviations correlate weakly or negatively with PSS, so their contribution to perceived stress is ambiguous.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean
- Balancing risks and protections, the most plausible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study sample mean PSS score of 21.6, with a modest tendency toward being slightly above the mean. This conclusion rests on mild-to-moderate elevations in trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance (which trend toward higher PSS), counterbalanced by strong protective factors (high self‑esteem, frequent exercise, healthy resting physiology, low substance use) that push toward lower perceived stress. Because the participant’s risk indicators are generally small-to-moderate in magnitude and there are several relatively large protective signals (e.g., self‑esteem Z = 1.38), the net impression is “near the mean, possibly slightly above it,” rather than markedly above or below.
- Uncertainty and caveats: The dataset does not include a direct PSS score for this participant in the materials provided, so this is an inferred comparison based on correlated measures. Several correlations with PSS in the dataset are small in magnitude, and some objective signals (circadian irregularity) and subjective reports (PSQI) point in different directions; therefore the classification should be regarded as probabilistic rather than definitive.

If useful, I can produce a short list of the highest-priority targets for intervention or monitoring (e.g., improving sleep timing regularity, addressing early‑morning arousal/worry, reinforcing exercise/social supports) based on the profile above."
44872,"Summary and overall inference
Taken together across self-report, behavioral, and wearable physiological data, the weight of evidence indicates that this participant’s perceived stress during the semester is most consistent with a level below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). Several robust self-report indicators (low depressive symptom burden, modest trait anxiety, high reported happiness and self‑esteem, regular exercise, and high health satisfaction) and a low resting heart rate support an inference of relatively lower perceived stress. However, there are notable countervailing signals (subjective and objective sleep disturbance, irregular sleep timing, reduced circadian stability) that are associated with elevated perceived stress in this sample; these raise the likelihood of situational strain for this individual despite the predominately protective profile.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress
Multiple self-report measures that are positively correlated with lower PSS in this sample point toward reduced perceived stress. The participant’s CES‑D score (5, z ≈ −0.86) and STAI–Trait score (39, z ≈ −0.23) are both below sample averages, indicating relatively low depressive and anxiety symptom reports. Self‑esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (RSES z ≈ +0.68; happiness z ≈ +1.64), and overall health satisfaction is high (z ≈ +1.3)—all of which tend to co-occur with lower PSS in the study. Behavioral routines that are typically protective—regular exercise alone and with others (both reported three times per week or more, z > 1)—and relatively active socializing (2–3 hours/day, z ≈ +0.95) further align with lower perceived stress. Physiologically, the participant’s resting heart rate is low (48.3 bpm, z ≈ −1.17), which often reflects higher aerobic fitness and is not consistent with the elevated resting arousal commonly associated with higher PSS (resting HR correlates positively with PSS in this sample).

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress
Contrasting indicators that tend to relate to higher perceived stress are present and merit attention. Subjective sleep quality is classified as “disturbed” on the PSQI (score = 6), and the participant exhibits substantial variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start time SD z ≈ +1.55; sleep duration SD z ≈ +0.77). These sleep irregularities and disturbance are positively correlated with PSS in the sample (sleep variability and start‑time variability correlations with PSS ~ +0.14 to +0.17). Circadian rhythm summary metrics derived from heart rate further suggest less regular daily structure: interdaily stability is low (value 0.29, z ≈ −0.99) and 24‑hour autocorrelation is reduced (z ≈ −1.37), while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (z ≈ +0.46). In this dataset, lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability trend with higher PSS, implying that irregular day‑to‑day timing and fragmented within‑day activity are potential contributors to perceived stress for this participant. Frequent alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor three times a week or more; z ≈ +1.7) may reflect a coping behavior in some contexts; correlation with PSS in this sample is small, but the pattern warrants consideration as a behavioral risk factor when interpreting stress.

Physiological and circadian pattern interpretation
Wearable heart‑rate patterns show a low overall MESOR (61.8 bpm, z ≈ −1.65) and prominent daytime peaks (large positive deviations around late morning and mid‑afternoon, e.g., 12–1pm and 5–6pm have very large positive z‑scores), with deep nighttime troughs. These features are consistent with a lower average cardiac arousal level and strong within‑day activity peaks—likely reflecting scheduled daytime activity or exercise—combined with relatively low mean heart rate. At the same time, the reduced interdaily stability and attenuated 24‑hour autocorrelation suggest that the timing of these activity peaks and rest periods is inconsistent across days. From a stress‑related perspective, this pattern (adequate daytime activity and low resting heart rate, but irregular daily timing) is mixed: the participant benefits physiologically from low resting arousal and clear daily activity peaks, but the irregular day‑to‑day timing and sleep timing variability align with stress‑sensitive circadian disruption and are associated with higher PSS in the sample.

Holistic conclusion and uncertainty
Balancing protective and risk signals, the preponderance of evidence points toward perceived stress below the study population mean (i.e., below 21.61), but not necessarily at the extreme low end of the distribution. Protective self‑report indicators (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high happiness and self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting HR) are relatively strong and carry direct links to lower PSS. Offsetting these are objective and subjective sleep disturbances and reduced circadian regularity, which are associated with higher PSS in this sample and suggest situational or behavioral stressors that could elevate perceived stress episodically. Given the mixed but overall favorable profile, the best characterization is “below the population mean” with moderate caveats: the participant appears to enjoy psychosocial and physiological strengths that reduce chronic perceived stress, yet sleep/circadian irregularity and frequent alcohol use represent plausible targets for interventions that could further lower perceived stress or prevent episodic increases."
27306,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of indicators. Self-report measures generally reflect relatively low affective symptom burden (CES-D = 6, STAI–Trait = 37) and comparatively high self-regard and health satisfaction (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = +1.66; health satisfaction Z = +1.8). Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4, Z = −1.26). Wearable-derived physiology and behavior show a low resting heart rate (46.2 bpm, Z = −1.42) and a mesor (63.03) below the study mean (Z = −1.49), but circadian regularity measures are not uniformly strong: interdaily stability is somewhat below average (0.38, Z = −0.24) while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.59, Z = +0.32). Nighttime heart rate deviations are markedly negative (expected sleep troughs), and there are pronounced daytime HR peaks, especially 7–8am and 4–5pm (large positive deviations, Z = +5.17 and +7.80 respectively). Median sleep duration is slightly shorter than the sample average (6 h 42 m, Z = −0.6) with moderate night-to-night variability.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several wearable-derived rhythm features that have positive correlations with PSS in the study are present at levels that could reflect greater perceived stress. Intradaily variability (fragmentation of the HR rhythm) is slightly elevated (Z = +0.32; correlation with PSS ≈ +0.16), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.28, Z = −0.36; correlation with PSS ≈ −0.17 for that metric in the sample), indicating somewhat weaker day-to-day rhythm stability. Shorter median sleep duration (≈6 h 42 m) and modest sleep timing variability could also contribute to perceived stress vulnerability (sleep duration Z = −0.6 and sleep start SD ≈ 57 min), and several daytime HR deviations (e.g., relatively elevated morning and late-afternoon HR spikes) indicate concentrated periods of physiological arousal that may coincide with daily demands (these hours show some small positive correlations with PSS in the sample). Taken together, the combination of slightly fragmented circadian rhythm and brief sleep could be interpreted as factors that increase the likelihood of elevated perceived stress relative to a tightly rhythmic, well-rested profile.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Multiple self-report and behavioral indicators point in the opposite direction. Depressive and trait-anxiety symptom scores are low (CES-D = 6; STAI–Trait = 37), both of which, in the study, correlate positively with PSS but are low for this participant—an indicator against high perceived stress. Self-esteem and health satisfaction are notably above average (RSES Z = +1.66; health satisfaction Z = +1.8), characteristics typically associated with lower perceived stress (self-esteem shows a negative correlation with PSS in the sample). The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone and with others three times per week or more) and minimal substance use, both behaviors that commonly support lower stress. Resting heart rate is low (46.2 bpm, Z = −1.42), consistent with higher cardiovascular fitness and lower baseline physiological arousal. Subjective sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI = 4), which also tends to protect against higher PSS even when total sleep time is mildly reduced.

Circadian and heart-rate pattern interpretation: The participant’s HR mesor and resting HR are lower than sample averages, suggesting low baseline cardiac activation—an indicator often associated with better cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic stress. However, the circadian rhythm shows modest irregularity: reduced interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability indicate less consistent timing and greater fragmentation of activity/arousal across days. The very large positive deviations in HR around 7–8am and 4–5pm likely reflect predictable periods of elevated activity (commute, exercise, classes) rather than pathological arousal; these strong peaks can produce large Z-scores when overall mesor is low. Because the aggregated hourly HR deviations are temporally averaged, they signal habitual daily peaks of activation rather than transient anomalies. The pattern—low baseline HR with episodic, large daytime peaks—fits a profile of a comparatively fit individual who still experiences concentrated periods of physiological activation across the day.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study mean PSS: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows more indicators associated with lower perceived stress (low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, frequent exercise, low resting HR, good subjective sleep) than indicators associated with higher perceived stress (slightly fragmented circadian rhythm, modestly short median sleep, episodic daytime HR arousal). Therefore the most defensible inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is at or somewhat below the study sample mean. Expressed relative to the population mean PSS = 21.62 (SD = 3.68), the profile is best described as near to slightly below the population mean for perceived stress rather than clearly above it.

Caveats: This inference integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable metrics; correlations provided in the dataset are associative and modest in magnitude and do not establish causation. The HR peaks could reflect scheduled physical activity rather than stress-driven arousal; BMI is low (17.11) and may interact with other health factors but should not be interpreted as diagnostic from these data alone. For a stronger estimate of perceived stress, a direct PSS score and time-locked event/context data would be preferable."
46365,"Summary — overall impression
Taken together, the self-report and wearable-derived data describe a participant with a mixed profile of risk and resilience for perceived stress. Trait anxiety is elevated relative to the study sample (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37), and there are behavioral and physiological indicators of evening arousal and irregular daily timing (see below) that point toward increased momentary or situational stress. At the same time, depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14), self-esteem is high (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26), subjective sleep quality is comparatively good (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8), and resting heart rate is relatively low (55.8 bpm, Z = -0.28). Balancing these elements, the overall pattern suggests perceived stress near the study population mean, with a modest tilt toward elevation rather than clear, marked elevation above the sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68).

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Elevated trait anxiety: The STAI Trait score is above the sample mean (Z = 0.37) and this measure has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31). This indicates a dispositional tendency toward anxiety that is plausibly associated with greater perceived stress.  
- Late-night physiological arousal and delayed sleep timing: Wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced relative increases in the late evening and around midnight (e.g., 11–12pm deviation = 15.45, Z = 1.79; 10–11pm = 14.85, Z = 1.32; 12–1am = 10.33, Z = 1.73). The median sleep start time is late (01:34), suggesting a delayed sleep schedule. Elevated nocturnal heart rate and late bedtimes can reflect cognitive/physiological arousal in the evening (worry, electronic/social activity) and are commonly associated with higher perceived stress or greater sympathetic activation.  
- Behavioral patterns that align with late arousal: The participant reports high internet use (>4 hours; Z = 2.19) and extensive socializing (>4 hours; Z = 2.53). These activities are temporally consistent with late-night elevated heart rate and, given modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample, may contribute to higher perceived stress through late-night stimulation, sleep-timing disruption, or evening worry/rumination.  
- Low health satisfaction and lower momentary well-being: Health satisfaction scores are relatively low (2.33 on 1–7, Z = -1.45) and current happiness is below average (Z = -0.53). Both of these indicators are consistent with psychosocial strain and can co-occur with higher perceived stress, even when depressive symptoms are not high.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Low depressive symptom burden and high self-esteem: The CES-D score is in the non‑depressed range (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) and the Rosenberg self-esteem score is at the top of the scale (40, Z = 0.26). Both factors are protective: depressive symptoms are positively correlated with PSS but are low here, and higher self-esteem is modestly negatively correlated with PSS in the sample.  
- Adequate objective sleep duration and good subjective sleep quality: Median wearable sleep duration is about 7 h 16 min (Z = 0.11), and the PSQI indicates relatively good subjective sleep (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Adequate sleep quantity and better subjective sleep quality are typically associated with lower perceived stress or better stress tolerance.  
- Physiological fitness indicator: Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.8 bpm, Z = -0.28), a metric that often indexes cardiovascular fitness and physiological resilience and that can buffer stress-related reactivity.  
- Social engagement and some physical activity: The participant reports substantial time socializing (which can act as a buffer against stress) and participates in sports 1–2 times per week (Z = 0.91). These social and activity resources are potential protective factors, despite low frequencies of solitary exercise.

Circadian rhythm and temporal-structure considerations
Circadian/rhythm metrics indicate a mixed picture of daily timing regularity. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are lower than the sample mean (interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.9; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ -1.37), indicating day-to-day variation in timing of activity/heart rate. Intradaily variability is also lower than average (Z ≈ -1.31), which suggests the within-day profile is not highly fragmented even if daily timing shifts occur across days. Practically, this looks like relatively consistent within-day patterns but with variability in the clock time those patterns occur (consistent with the late and shifting sleep starts). Because disrupted or irregular 24-hour structure can increase perceived stress in some contexts, the reduced interdaily stability and weak 24-hour autocorrelation are relevant risk signals; however, the low intradaily fragmentation and adequate sleep duration mitigate severity of that risk.

A balanced, quantitative conclusion about relative PSS
Weighing the evidence, the participant presents mixed signals: dispositional anxiety and markers of evening arousal and irregular timing point to elevated perceived stress risk, while low depressive symptoms, high self‑esteem, adequate sleep duration/quality, low resting HR, and substantial social time argue for resilience. Given the magnitudes of the available indicators and their sample correlations, the most defensible summary is that the participant’s perceived stress is likely close to the study sample mean, with modest evidence for a slight elevation rather than a strong deviation. In other words: near the population mean PSS (21.62), with some features suggesting a small shift upward relative to the mean rather than a clear, large elevation above it.

Practical implications to consider (research-relevant)
- The combination of late sleep onset and elevated late-evening heart rate suggests targeted collection or intervention during evening hours (e.g., assessing evening rumination, screen use, or alcohol timing) could clarify causal links to perceived stress.  
- Trait anxiety is a consistent correlate and may moderate the impact of evening arousal on perceived stress; measuring state anxiety or situational stressors would help refine prediction of PSS.  
- Protective factors (high self-esteem, good sleep quantity, low depressive symptoms, social engagement) are likely important buffers; future models should treat these as moderators rather than absent factors.

If you would like, I can synthesize these findings into a concise bullet-point summary for quick reporting, or estimate a likely PSS score range based on a simple weighted algorithm using the reported correlations."
23287,"Summary and overall comparison: Across the available self-report and wearable-derived measures, the preponderance of evidence points toward a level of perceived stress that is below the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). Objective physiological markers (very low resting heart rate and mesor; z-scores ≈ -2.1 and -2.2) together with favorable self-report scores for depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, z = -0.76), trait anxiety (STAI = 37, z = -0.43), subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 3, z = -1.72), and high health satisfaction (z = 1.71) are most consistent with lower perceived stress relative to the cohort average.

Evidence consistent with relatively low perceived stress: Multiple indicators converge on lower stress or good adaptation. Self-reported mood and trait measures are in the nonclinical range (low depressive symptoms, non-elevated trait anxiety, high self-esteem), and the participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI well below the commonly used cutoff). Wearable sleep metrics show long median nightly sleep duration (8 h 23 min; z = 1.49) and only modest variability in sleep start time (SD z = -0.15), which often support better recovery and lower perceived stress. Low resting heart rate and low mesor (RHR = 40.6 bpm; mesor = 57.8, both strongly negative z-scores) likely reflect good cardiovascular fitness rather than stress-related sympathetic activation. Circadian regularity measures are not notably disrupted: interdaily stability is slightly above average (z = 0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (z = 0.48), indicative of a reasonably consistent daily rhythm. Low substance use, relatively frequent exercise with others (z = 1.23), and high health satisfaction further align with protective behavioral patterns.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress or vulnerability: A few features suggest potential stress-related or stress-maintaining processes. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (value 0.57, z = 0.17) and sleep duration shows some variability (SD ≈ 130 minutes, z = 0.67); both are associated in the study with modest positive correlations to PSS, implying fragmented or inconsistent rest-activity patterns that can relate to perceived stress. The participant reports minimal time socializing with friends (16–30 minutes; z = -1.41), which could represent reduced social buffering. Mean daily naps are elevated (0.25 naps/day, z = 2.07) and nap frequency is modestly correlated with higher PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.15), which may reflect daytime tiredness or compensatory sleep behavior. Daily internet use is higher than average (3–4 hours; z = 1.52) and has a small positive correlation with PSS in this cohort (r ≈ 0.11); excessive screen time can be associated with stress or reduced restorative activities. Finally, there is some within-day heart rate structure suggesting pronounced evening increases (large positive deviations around 9–11 pm, z-scores up to ~2.37); although these hourly deviations are only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample, evening physiological arousal patterns can be associated with rumination or delayed recovery in some individuals.

Integrated interpretation and caveats: Taken together, the balance of evidence favors an inference that this participant’s perceived stress is below the study sample mean. Protective factors—low depressive and anxiety symptoms, good subjective sleep quality and objectively long nightly sleep, low resting heart rate (likely reflecting fitness), regular circadian timing, low substance use, and frequent group exercise—carry considerable weight and are more directly linked to lower PSS in the cohort. Countervailing signals (greater nap frequency, somewhat elevated intradaily variability, limited socializing time, and elevated evening heart-rate deviations) are present but smaller in magnitude and are associated with only modest correlations to PSS in the sample; these represent risk or vigilance factors worth monitoring rather than dominant indicators of high stress. Limitations include the absence of a direct PSS score for this participant in the dataset and the fact that some physiological markers (e.g., low resting HR) can reflect competing influences (fitness versus autonomic tone). Overall, the profile suggests perceived stress near or below the population mean—more specifically, below the mean—while recommending attention to social engagement, daytime sleepiness/napping, and evening arousal as potential leverage points if perceived stress increases."
28247,"Summary of self-report indicators: The participant reports markedly elevated symptoms on measures that commonly co-occur with perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 61, Z = 1.95) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29, Z = 1.63) are substantially above the study mean; both scales have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28), which increases the likelihood that perceived stress is elevated. Subjective sleep quality is also disturbed (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59), a pattern often associated with higher stress. In contrast, the participant reports higher-than-average current happiness (Z = 0.55) and low substance use, and retains good academic performance (GPA consistently high), which are features that can buffer stress. Self-esteem is below average (RSES Z = −1.01) and health satisfaction is low (Z = −1.03), which may reduce resilience to stressors.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular features: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a pattern of reduced rhythm robustness and greater within-day fragmentation. Interdaily stability is low (0.23, Z = −1.48), amplitude is reduced (5.8, Z = −1.61), and intradaily variability is elevated (0.76, Z = 1.51). Elevated intradaily variability and reduced amplitude are both modestly positively correlated with PSS in the sample (intraday variability r ≈ 0.16), suggesting that the participant’s circadian irregularity aligns with higher perceived stress. Resting heart rate is modestly above average (62.2 bpm, Z = 0.48) and the mesor is near the mean (75.03, Z = 0.15); these cardiovascular values are only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample (resting HR r ≈ 0.14), but together with the circadian irregularity they point to an autonomic profile of greater physiological arousal and reduced regularity, which can be associated with higher stress.

Sleep behavior and timing variability: Objective sleep duration is slightly short relative to the cohort (median 6 hr 26 min, Z = −0.94) and sleep onset timing is highly irregular (median start 01:03, sleep-start SD = 208 minutes, Z = 2.74). High night-to-night variability in sleep timing (large positive Z) is associated in this dataset with higher PSS (sleep-start SD r ≈ 0.17). Although mean nap frequency is negligible, the combination of shorter-than-average nightly sleep and very inconsistent bedtimes signals a behavioral pattern that tends to exacerbate perceived stress and daytime dysregulation.

Hourly heart-rate deviations and daily activity timing: Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations, with morning increases around 8–10am and evening peaks late afternoon/early evening. Some early-morning and wake-related hourly deviations have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (e.g., 3–7am hours showing modest positive correlations), consistent with the idea that altered overnight physiology and morning arousal patterns relate to higher perceived stress. The reported acrophase (~4:08 PM) is within a typical late-afternoon timing but, given the low amplitude, suggests a flattened daily rhythm.

Behavioral context and potential stress buffers: Several reported behaviors may mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports substantial social time and engagement with music (both high Z-scores: socializing Z = 2.53, listening to music Z = 2.06), low recreational drug use, and limited alcohol use—patterns often associated with social support and adaptive coping. Conversely, physical activity is very infrequent (exercise and sports Zs ≪ 0), and sedentary/recreational screen time is minimal, which may reflect constrained opportunities for active stress regulation. Overall, behavioral supports (social engagement, hobbies) are present alongside reduced physical activity and poor sleep regularity.

Balanced interpretation and synthesis: Factors pointing toward relatively high perceived stress include markedly elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores (STAI and CES-D, both high Z), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), wearable indicators of circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability, low amplitude, high intradaily variability), highly variable sleep timing (sleep-start SD Z = 2.74), and modestly elevated resting heart rate. These features have small-to-moderate associations with PSS in the sample and together form a consistent pattern favoring elevated perceived stress. Factors suggesting lower perceived stress include strong social engagement and frequent music listening (both high Z), low substance use, absence of naps, and preserved academic performance; these likely provide coping resources that can buffer stress. Several physiological indicators, such as a near-mean mesor and only modestly elevated resting heart rate, are not strongly indicative of extreme physiological stress.

Overall inference relative to the study population mean: Considering the balance of evidence—particularly the high trait anxiety and depressive symptom burden, disturbed subjective sleep, and pronounced circadian irregularity—the participant’s inferred perceived stress is most consistent with being above the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61). The combination of psychometric elevations that correlate with PSS and wearable markers of rhythm fragmentation supports an interpretation of higher-than-average perceived stress, although presence of social engagement and low substance use suggest some protective factors that may moderate severity."
72806,"Summary assessment
Taken together, the multimodal data indicate a profile more consistent with relatively lower perceived stress than the study sample average, while also containing a small set of behavioral and physiological signals that could reflect situational strain or greater short‑term arousal. Objective wearable measures of circadian regularity and cardiovascular baseline, together with self-report measures of depression, trait anxiety and sleep quality, provide the strongest evidence supporting a lower perceived stress inference; secondary signals (some intraday variability, evening heart‑rate elevation, modestly reduced self‑reported happiness and health satisfaction, and nap frequency) temper that conclusion by suggesting possible episodic or context-dependent stressors. Relative to the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.62), the aggregate pattern is most consistent with a PSS level below the population mean.

Indicators consistent with lower perceived stress
Several converging signals point away from high perceived stress. Self‑report screening scores for depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 5, z ≈ −0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 33, z ≈ −0.82) are well below the study mean, which typically corresponds to lower affective symptom burden and lower chronic anxiety proneness. Sleep quality self‑report (PSQI = 5, z ≈ −0.8) and a median nocturnal sleep duration in the healthy range (7 h 34 m, z ≈ +0.47) further support adequate restorative sleep, a buffer against perceived stress. Objective cardiovascular indices also favor a lower‑stress interpretation: resting heart rate is low (56.4 bpm, z ≈ −0.21) and the cosinor amplitude of the heart‑rate rhythm is larger than average (amplitude z ≈ +0.56), which—along with an above‑average interdaily stability (value 0.47, z ≈ +0.5)—indicates fairly consistent, robust circadian organization of physiological activity. High academic performance (GPA consistently high) and low substance use additionally align with behavioral stability that often co‑occurs with lower perceived stress.

Indicators consistent with higher or situationally elevated perceived stress
Countervailing signals that could indicate episodic strain or higher momentary arousal are present but generally subtler. Intradaily variability in heart rate (value 0.55, z ≈ 0.03) is slightly elevated and has a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample, which can reflect greater fragmentation of activity/rest or transient autonomic reactivity. The participant shows one pronounced hourly heart‑rate deviation in the early evening (6–7 pm deviation from mesor = +25.34, z ≈ +2.22), suggesting marked physiological arousal during that time window on average; while this single‑hour aggregate should be interpreted cautiously, it could reflect consistent evening activity, social or academic demands, or stress‑related arousal. Self‑reported current happiness (score 3.0, z ≈ −0.53) and health satisfaction (z ≈ −0.7) are somewhat lower than average, which—though small in magnitude—are associated in the sample with higher perceived stress. Additional small signals that correlate positively with PSS in this dataset include a modest mean daily nap frequency (z ≈ +0.7) and sleep timing variability (sleep start SD ≈ 68 minutes), both of which can reflect occasional sleep disruption or daytime fatigue that accompany higher short‑term stress.

Circadian and hourly heart‑rate pattern interpretation
Circadian metrics point to an organized, regular rhythm overall: interdaily stability is above average, amplitude is elevated, and mesor is slightly below average, indicating a relatively strong day–night contrast in heart‑rate activity with a modestly lower mean heart rate. The acrophase at about 4:00 PM places the daily heart‑rate peak in mid‑afternoon to early evening, which is consistent with typical activity timing. Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (large negative deviations overnight) and elevated daytime/evening deviations, with the most extreme relative increase in the 6–7 pm hour. These hourly patterns likely reflect normal activity scheduling (wake‑active periods vs. sleep), but the relatively large evening peak suggests consistent physiological activation during that time that may be driven by exercise, social or academic obligations, or stress‑related arousal. Because the hourly values are aggregated across days, they cannot identify specific events but do indicate consistent daily timing of higher arousal.

Holistic conclusion and relative position vs. the study sample
Balancing the evidence, the most salient and heavily weighted indicators (low CES‑D and STAI, adequate self‑reported sleep quality and duration, low resting heart rate, above‑average circadian stability and amplitude, low substance use, and high academic performance) favor an overall inference of lower perceived stress relative to the sample. Secondary and smaller magnitude signals (slightly elevated intradaily variability, evening heart‑rate spike, modestly lower happiness/health satisfaction, and nap frequency) suggest occasional or time‑of‑day–specific arousal that could reflect situational stressors but do not outweigh the primary pattern. On balance, the participant’s data are most consistent with a perceived stress level below the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.62), though not necessarily at the extreme low end of the distribution—i.e., lower than average but with some indications of episodic or context‑specific arousal.

Caveats
These inferences integrate cross‑sectional self‑report and aggregated wearable metrics; correlations provided in the dataset are small to modest and do not establish causation. The hourly heart‑rate aggregates are temporally pooled and cannot resolve day‑to‑day variability or specific triggers. Any interpretation should be understood as probabilistic and relative to the study sample rather than as an absolute clinical determination."
39146,"Summary
Across self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological measures the participant presents a mixed profile with coherent signals of both physiological arousal and psychosocial resilience. Trait anxiety (STAI) is near the sample average but flagged as “anxious” (score = 42, Z ≈ 0.07), resting heart rate and mean heart-rate mesor are elevated relative to the study population (RHR = 65.4, mesor = 78.4; RHR Z = 0.86, mesor Z = 0.61), while several markers that typically index adaptive functioning — higher self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.68), low depressive symptom burden (CES-D Z = -0.24), good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8), and strong day-to-day circadian regularity (autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 1.15; interdaily stability Z = 0.42) — are also present. Taken together, the pattern is not unambiguously high or low stress; on balance the data suggest perceived stress comparable to the sample average, with some modest physiological signs of increased arousal but multiple psychosocial and behavioral buffers. Overall inferred perceived stress: near the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61), slightly tending toward below-mean when psychosocial protections are weighted.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Physiological arousal: resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to peers (RHR Z = 0.86; mesor Z = 0.61). These metrics correlate positively with PSS in the sample (RHR correlation ≈ 0.13; mesor correlation ≈ 0.06), consistent with modestly greater autonomic activation that often accompanies higher perceived stress.  
- Intraday fragmentation: intradaily variability is above average (value = 0.62, Z = 0.53) and shows a positive correlation with PSS (≈ 0.16), suggesting more within-day variability in heart-rate signals that can reflect wear-and-tear or behavioral irregularity linked to stress.  
- Sleep timing and short sleep: median sleep start time is late (01:32) and median sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 48 min, Z = -0.47). Later bedtimes and somewhat shorter sleep duration are often associated with higher perceived stress or reduced recovery.  
- Momentary affect: self-reported current happiness is below the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and correlates negatively with well-being and positively with PSS in the sample, which supports the presence of some affective strain.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Subjective sleep quality and stability: PSQI indicates generally good subjective sleep (score = 5, PSQI Z = -0.8), sleep duration variability is low (SD = 62 minutes, Z = -0.89), and mean daily naps are absent (Z = -0.86), which together suggest consistent sleep patterns and subjective restorative sleep that buffer stress.  
- Circadian regularity: strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.15) and above-average interdaily stability (Z = 0.42) indicate regular day-to-day heart-rate rhythms; those non-parametric circadian features correlate negatively with PSS in the sample and are generally protective for perceived stress.  
- Psychosocial strengths and behavior: higher self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.68) and relatively low depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = -0.24) are both associated with lower perceived stress (RSES correlates ≈ -0.16 with PSS). The participant reports minimal substance use and a high level of academic performance (GPA consistently >3.7), which are additional contextual indicators of functioning that tend to align with lower PSS.  
- Active coping/leisure: relatively high time spent in video games and listening to music (video games Z = 2.47; music Z = 1.13) may reflect engagement in leisure or distraction strategies; in the sample these activities are weakly negatively or not strongly positively correlated with PSS, consistent with potential short-term emotion regulation benefits.

Circadian and hourly cardiac profile — integration
The cosinor and aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a coherent daily rhythm with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 3:57 PM) and larger-than-average daytime elevations (notably early afternoon and early evening hours) and expected negative deviations at night. The pronounced 24-hour autocorrelation and interdaily stability point to a well-entrained circadian system despite a late average sleep onset. Elevated daytime deviations and higher resting HR suggest greater daytime physiological activation, while the large nocturnal negative deviations show that nightly heart-rate reductions are preserved. Functionally, this combination indicates preserved nighttime recovery alongside augmented daytime autonomic tone — a pattern that can coexist with ordinary subjective sleep quality but still reflect higher allostatic load or reactivity.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSS
Balancing the signals of modestly elevated physiological arousal and intraday variability against multiple psychosocial and sleep-related strengths, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with perceived stress near the study population mean and, when psychosocial buffers are weighted, slightly below the mean. In other words: the participant does not present the constellation of markers that typically accompany markedly elevated perceived stress relative to peers, but there are measurable signs of increased daytime physiological activation and some affective strain that warrant attention. Relative to the study sample mean PSS of 21.61 (SD = 3.68), the inferred PSS level is best characterized as near the mean, with a modest bias toward below-mean perceived stress when integrating subjective sleep quality, self-esteem, and circadian regularity.

Key caveats
This synthesis is probabilistic and relies on cross-sectional group correlations and summary wearable metrics. Individual PSS score was not provided; therefore the inference is an integrated, evidence-weighted estimate rather than a direct measurement. Physiological elevations (RHR, intraday variability) and late sleep timing are objective signals that could reflect situational stressors or other influences (e.g., fitness, caffeine, schedule demands), so interpreting them as stress-specific should be done cautiously and in context."
67918,"Protective indicators consistent with relatively low perceived stress are prominent across both self-report and wearable-derived measures. On self-report, depressive symptom scores (CES‑D = 5) and trait anxiety (STAI = 35) are well below the study mean (Z = −0.86 and −0.62 respectively), and self‑esteem is comparatively high (RSES Z = 1.38). Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 3, Z = −1.72) and the participant’s academic performance and health satisfaction are high (multiple GPAs ≈ 3.9; health satisfaction Z = 1.22). Many of these self-report measures are moderately correlated with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so the participant’s low scores on those instruments point toward lower perceived stress.

Wearable physiology and sleep behavior further support a low‑stress interpretation. The participant shows long and consistent sleep (median nightly sleep 8 h 42 min, Z = 1.88; sleep start SD ≈ 55 min, Z ≈ −0.6; virtually no naps), and robust circadian structure in heart‑rate measures: high interdaily stability (0.59, Z = 1.49), high 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.52, Z = 1.65), and relatively large circadian amplitude (15.71, Z = 1.59). Intradaily variability is low (IV = 0.37, Z = −1.24), indicating little fragmentation of daily heart‑rate patterns. In this sample these circadian regularity features tend to correlate negatively with PSS (e.g., amplitude r ≈ −0.17; autocorrelation r ≈ −0.17; interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12), so the participant’s relatively strong, regular rhythms align with lower perceived stress.

Factors that could point toward comparatively higher perceived stress are fewer and smaller in magnitude but deserve consideration. Resting heart rate is modestly above the sample mean (RHR = 62.8 bpm, Z = 0.55; RHR–PSS correlation ≈ 0.14), and the participant reports somewhat lower momentary happiness (current happiness Z ≈ −0.53, correlation with PSS ≈ −0.19), which could reflect transient negative affect. Physical‑activity behaviors are limited (exercise and sports frequencies are low relative to peers), and although correlations between exercise frequency and PSS in this sample are small, low habitual physical activity is a potential behavioral risk factor. Overall, these signals are weaker and less consistent than the protective indicators described above.

Integrating the evidence, the balance of data—low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem, good subjective sleep, long and regular objective sleep, and strong circadian heart‑rate structure—supports an inference of perceived stress below the study population mean. Using the study sample context (population PSS mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the participant’s profile is most consistent with a PSS level below the mean rather than near or above it. This inference should be qualified by the absence of a directly reported PSS score in the dataset and by the modest size of some wearable–PSS correlations; nevertheless, the multimodal pattern is convergent and indicates relatively lower perceived stress compared with the study cohort."
34467,"Summary overview: The participant’s data present a mixed profile in which several behavioral and physiological signals typically associated with stress co-occur with robust indicators of psychological well-being and healthy lifestyle. Self-report instruments show low depressive (CES-D = 7, z = -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 33, z = -0.82) scores, high self-esteem (RSES = 40) and elevated momentary happiness (current happy = 5, z = 1.64). Objective wearable measures show generally sufficient median sleep duration (7 h 24 min, z = 0.28) and a low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm, z = -1.49). At the same time, subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 8), circadian fragmentation is relatively high (intradaily variability z = 1.44), and sleep timing is variable (sleep-start SD z = 1.12). The pattern suggests competing influences on perceived stress rather than a univocal signal.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several features that correlate positively with perceived stress appear elevated for this participant. Subjective sleep quality is impaired (PSQI = 8), which is often associated with greater perceived stress; the participant’s night-to-night variability in sleep onset is above the study average (sleep-start SD z = 1.12), and sleep-duration variability is also elevated (SD ≈ 128 minutes, z = 0.61). Wearable-derived circadian metrics point to reduced day-to-day rhythm stability (interdaily stability z = -0.9) and increased intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability z = 1.44), a combination that—based on the provided correlations—tends to accompany higher PSS scores. Several hourly heart-rate deviations (strong morning peaks at 7–9 am and an evening peak around 7–8 pm; large negative deviations at night) indicate pronounced physiological contrast between rest and active periods; the relative magnitude of these fluctuations combined with rhythm fragmentation can reflect behavioral irregularity and physiological reactivity that often track with elevated perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Multiple robust indicators point toward lower perceived stress. Self-report mental health measures are low for depressive and anxiety symptoms and high for self-esteem and momentary wellbeing—factors that consistently predict lower perceived stress. The participant reports limited substance use and regular social/structured exercise (exercising with others three or more times weekly, z = 1.23), which are protective behaviors associated with reduced stress. Objective sleep quantity is adequate on median nights (≈7.4 hours) and naps are infrequent; the participant’s resting heart rate and MESOR are notably low (resting HR z = -1.49, MESOR z = -2.13), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness, which is generally associated with greater stress resilience. Academic performance (high GPAs) and high health satisfaction (z = 0.8) further support a context of functioning that would typically reduce perceived stress.

Circadian and physiological synthesis: The wearable circadian profile indicates a relatively low-magnitude, low-mesor heart-rate rhythm with marked intraday variability and reduced interdaily stability. Low MESOR and low resting heart rate likely reflect fitness and lower basal physiological arousal, which tend to be protective; however, the elevated intradaily variability and reduced stability indicate fragmented daily structure and variable transitions between rest and activity. These circadian irregularities align with the participant’s subjective report of disturbed sleep despite adequate average duration, and they map onto small-to-moderate positive correlations with the PSS in the study (e.g., intradaily variability ~+0.16, sleep-start SD ~+0.17). In sum, physiology suggests a generally low baseline arousal but a less organized daily rhythm that could elevate perceived stress under certain situational demands.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study mean: Balancing the strong indicators of psychological well-being, physical fitness, limited substance use, social exercise, and adequate median sleep against the signals of disturbed subjective sleep, variable sleep timing, and elevated circadian fragmentation, the overall profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level near the study population mean. In other words, based on the available multimodal evidence the participant’s inferred PSS is likely near the mean PSS for the sample (population mean = 21.61). This conclusion emphasizes that protective psychosocial resources and good baseline physiology likely offset some risk conferred by sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity, producing an overall stress level close to the cohort average rather than clearly above or below it.

Key caveats: These inferences combine cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable metrics and do not substitute for a direct PSS measurement. Several correlations in the dataset are modest in magnitude; hence, conclusions are probabilistic rather than definitive. If finer resolution is needed, comparing this participant’s actual PSS score (if available) to the stated population distribution would provide the most direct confirmation."
59673,"Low-stress indicators: Several self-report trait and functioning measures point toward lower perceived stress relative to the study sample. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7) and trait anxiety (STAI = 37) are both below the sample mean (Z-scores −0.66 and −0.43, respectively), and current happiness and trust scores are modestly above average (happiness Z = 0.55; trust Z = 1.15). Self-esteem is substantially elevated (Rosenberg RSES Z = 1.66), which is independently associated with lower perceived stress in the sample (score correlation with PSS = −0.15). Academic performance is strong (GPAs 3.74–3.92), indicating preserved cognitive/occupational functioning. Together, these trait- and function-level indicators provide consistent evidence of psychological resources and functioning that would tend to lower perceived stress relative to peers.

Higher-stress indicators: Multiple sleep- and circadian-related metrics point in the opposite direction and are plausibly linked to greater perceived stress. The participant’s PSQI score is 8 (classified as disturbed sleep; Z = 0.59), median sleep start time is late (01:21), and night-to-night sleep timing and duration are variable (sleep duration SD = 144 minutes, Z = 0.98; sleep start SD = 98 minutes, Z = 0.33). Mean daily naps are somewhat elevated (0.18/day; Z = 1.27). Wearable circadian metrics show modestly elevated intradaily variability (0.57; Z = 0.17; correlation with PSS = 0.16) and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation (value 0.24; Z = −0.70; correlation with PSS = −0.17 for the metric), suggesting less stable day-to-day rhythmicity. These sleep and circadian disruptions are commonly associated with higher perceived stress and map onto small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample.

Physiological and temporal activity patterns: Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated cardiovascular activity in the late evening and early night (notably 12–1am deviation Z = 1.72, 11pm–12am Z = 1.49, and 6–7pm Z = 1.44), while resting heart rate is relatively low (57.2 bpm; Z = −0.11). The evening/night elevations in heart-rate deviation may reflect late-night arousal or activity (consistent with the late sleep onset), which can be both a marker of behavioral schedule (late wake/sleep) and of physiological hyperarousal. Overall cosinor parameters (MESOR and amplitude near average) and interdaily stability close to the mean suggest circadian signal is present but less tightly entrained than in many peers.

Holistic assessment relative to the sample mean PSS: Evidence is mixed. Trait and functioning measures (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem and happiness, strong academic performance) point toward lower perceived stress, whereas sleep timing irregularity, higher PSQI, increased intradaily variability, reduced 24-hour autocorrelation, and evening heart-rate elevations point toward factors that typically accompany higher perceived stress. Balancing these sources, the overall profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level near the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). The pattern suggests the participant likely does not have markedly higher perceived stress than peers, but has circadian/sleep-related risk factors that could push perceived stress upward under sustained pressure or during acute demands.

Summary implication: In short, trait-level resilience and functioning argue for lower perceived stress while objective sleep/circadian disruption and evening physiological arousal argue for higher perceived stress; taken together the participant’s likely perceived stress level is near the population mean rather than clearly above or below it."
74899,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals, but overall the balance of evidence (elevated trait anxiety, elevated depressive symptoms, disturbed subjective sleep, circadian fragmentation, late and short sleep) points to greater perceived stress than the study sample average. Relative to the study population mean PSS of 21.59 (SD = 3.65), the participant’s pattern of psychological and physiological measures is most consistent with an inferred PSS score above the population mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety (STAI trait = 52, Z = +1.06) is elevated compared with the sample and has one of the strongest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (r = 0.31). Elevated trait anxiety is therefore a primary contributor to an inference of higher perceived stress.  
- Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 17, Z = +0.38; classification “Depressed” per the instrument) is also elevated and positively correlated with PSS (r = 0.28), reinforcing the expectation of higher perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05, classified as disturbed sleep). Disturbed sleep is commonly associated with higher perceived stress; the participant’s PSQI is substantially above the cohort mean and thus supports a higher-stress interpretation.  
- Behavioral sleep pattern: wearable-recorded median sleep duration is short (5 h 58 min, Z = −1.52) with a very late median sleep start (~02:25 AM). Although the direct sample-level correlation between sleep duration and PSS is minimal (r ≈ −0.03 in this dataset), these objectively short and delayed sleep behaviors are clinically relevant stress-related markers and align with other elevated symptom measures here.  
- Circadian/variability measures show indications of fragmentation that align with higher stress: intradaily variability is elevated (value = 0.61, Z = +0.46; correlation with PSS r = +0.16), and the 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively low (0.30, Z = −0.19; correlation r = −0.17), suggesting less stable day-to-day rhythmicity — a pattern associated in this sample with higher perceived stress.  
- Physiological arousal markers: resting heart rate and overall mesor are somewhat elevated (resting HR = 62.1 bpm, Z = +0.47; mesor = 80.87, Z = +0.95), and these values have small positive correlations with PSS (resting HR r = +0.13). Elevated evening departures from mesor (notably a pronounced positive deviation 5–6 pm: +22.1, Z = +1.69) suggest periods of sustained sympathetic/behavioral activation in the late afternoon/early evening that could be compatible with stress-related arousal or evening activity patterns that interfere with recovery.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Several behavioral and subjective indicators are protective or inconsistent with high stress: frequent exercise (exercised alone three times per week or more, Z = +1.07) and moderate socializing (1–2 hours, Z ≈ +0.16) are behaviors typically associated with lower perceived stress; in this dataset correlations between exercise/socializing and PSS are small but in a protective direction or near-zero.  
- High self-rated physical health satisfaction (score = 6/7; Z = +1.30) and a relatively low BMI (20.67) are favorable for well-being and may mitigate stress-related burden; their correlations with PSS in this sample are small but negative.  
- High interpersonal trust (score Z = +1.79) could reflect stronger social resources, which often buffer perceived stress; the sample-level correlation between trust and PSS is negligible here (r ≈ −0.05), but the behavioral context is nonetheless supportive.  
- Low use of recreational/non-prescribed drugs and moderate alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week) reduce the likelihood of substance-related exacerbation of stress in this participant.

Circadian and heart-rate derived commentary
- Cosinor-derived measures indicate a relatively elevated mesor (Z ≈ +0.95) and modestly increased amplitude (Z ≈ +0.54) with acrophase in the early evening (≈17:49). The combination of a substantial evening peak in mean heart-rate deviation (largest positive deviations 4–8 pm, especially 5–6 pm) and elevated intraday variability suggests daytime/evening periods of higher physiological activation and less smooth transitions across the 24-hour cycle. In this sample, increased intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation are associated with higher PSS, so these circadian signatures provide physiological corroboration of heightened perceived stress. Nighttime heart-rate deviations are large negative as expected during sleep, but the late sleep onset reduces nocturnal opportunity for physiological recovery.

Integrated behavioral/sleep interpretation
- The participant’s late sleep timing (~02:25 AM median), short nightly sleep duration, and limited napping (mean daily naps = 0) produce a pattern of insufficient and delayed sleep opportunity. Even though sleep-duration-to-PSS correlations in the sample are small, the coexistence of poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9) and late, short objective sleep is consistent with reduced restorative sleep and likely contributes to the subjective experience of higher stress and to elevated trait symptom measures. Sleep timing variability (start-time SD ≈ 65 minutes) is moderate and may compound circadian misalignment effects.

Holistic conclusion
- Balancing all evidence, the participant’s profile is best interpreted as reflecting perceived stress above the study population mean. The strongest contributors to this inference are elevated trait anxiety (STAI), elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), circadian fragmentation (higher intradaily variability and lower 24-hour autocorrelation), and behavioral sleep patterns (late onset, short duration). Protective factors — frequent exercise, good self-rated physical health, higher interpersonal trust, and some social contact — may moderate stress impact but do not outweigh the preponderance of indicators associated with higher PSS in this case. Overall, the multimodal data support an inference of perceived stress above the population mean PSS (21.59), with the most salient drivers being anxiety, mood symptoms, and circadian/physiological irregularity."
35011,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mix of physiological, behavioral, and self-report indicators that together point toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Key objective signals include a high resting heart rate (77.6 bpm, Z = +2.31) and pronounced disruption of heart-rate–based circadian organization (low interdaily stability Z = -1.98, low 24-hour autocorrelation Z = -1.62, and markedly reduced circadian amplitude Z = -2.10). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 7, “disturbed sleep”), median nightly sleep is short (6 hr 5 min, Z = -1.37) and sleep onset is very late (median start ~02:34). These physiologic and sleep characteristics—together with depressed-symptom burden (CES-D = 20, Z = +0.7)—constitute the strongest evidence in the data that aligns with higher perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress: 
- Circadian and autonomic markers: The participant’s circadian rhythm metrics indicate blunted and irregular daily structure. Interdaily stability is well below the sample mean (Z = -1.98) and intradaily variability is elevated (Z = +1.37). Low amplitude (Z = -2.10) and low day-to-day autocorrelation (Z = -1.62) reflect a damped, inconsistent heart‑rate rhythm across days; these features are commonly associated with stress-related disruption of daily routines and autonomic regulation.  
- Elevated resting cardiac tone: Resting heart rate is markedly higher than peers (Z = +2.31), a physiologic correlate that in this dataset shows a positive association with PSS (correlation ~+0.15).  
- Sleep timing and subjective sleep problems: Sleep onset near 02:34 and short median sleep duration, combined with a PSQI >5, indicate both late timing and poor perceived sleep—sleep disturbance is frequently linked with greater perceived stress.  
- Behavioral lifestyle factors: Low frequency of exercise (1–2×/month), limited socializing (below average), and low self‑rated physical health satisfaction (score 1.89, Z ≈ -1.78) reduce behavioral resilience to stress. Alcohol use at slightly above-average frequency (beer and wine 1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1) may further index coping behavior that co-occurs with elevated perceived stress in some individuals.  
- Depressive symptoms: The CES‑D score of 20 (Z = +0.7) indicates elevated depressive symptomatology; in this sample CES‑D shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS (≈ +0.29), so the presence of depressive symptoms supports an interpretation of above-average perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress:
- Trait and positive affect indicators: Trait anxiety is below the study mean (STAI = 36, Z ≈ -0.52, classified “not anxious”), and current happiness is above average (self-rated happy = 4.0, Z ≈ +0.55). Both variables have negative correlations with PSS in the sample (happiness r ≈ -0.19, trait anxiety r ≈ +0.31 but here below mean), which points to some psychological resources that could buffer perceived stress.  
- Self-esteem: The participant’s self‑esteem is higher than the sample mean (Rosenberg score, Z ≈ +0.96); higher self‑esteem is modestly associated with lower perceived stress in this dataset (correlation ≈ -0.15).  
- Absence of recreational drug use and minimal napping: The participant reports no recreational or non‑prescribed drug use and essentially no daytime napping—behaviors that are often neutral or protective in relation to perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean PSS: Taking the evidence together, the balance of objective physiologic markers (high resting HR, blunted and irregular circadian HR rhythms), objective and subjective sleep disturbance (short sleep, late sleep timing, PSQI >5), reduced behavioral resilience (low exercise, limited socializing), and elevated depressive symptoms provides stronger and more direct indication of elevated perceived stress than the modestly protective signals (lower trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, and moderate self-reported happiness). Given the pattern and the magnitudes of relevant Z-scores (notably resting HR Z = +2.31 and circadian amplitude Z = -2.10; interdaily stability Z = -1.98), the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level is best characterized as above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). In other words, this participant appears to have moderately elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample.

Uncertainties and caveats: Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the sample are generally small to moderate, so any single feature should not be overinterpreted. The protective self-report measures (low trait anxiety, higher self-esteem, moderate happiness) reduce certainty that perceived stress is severely elevated; however, the convergence of multiple objective circadian and autonomic markers with poor sleep and depressive symptoms points to a reliable signal of higher-than-average perceived stress. If clinical or intervention decisions are to be made, these patterns would warrant follow-up assessment focused on sleep timing and quality, daily routine regularity, mood symptoms, and autonomic indicators."
89710,"Summary — This participant’s multimodal profile combines marked symptom-report elevations (depressive and anxiety symptoms, poor subjective sleep, low self‑esteem and low reported happiness) with wearable-derived signs of circadian irregularity and evening physiological activation. Together these features point to greater perceived stress than is typical in the study sample. Below I summarize signals that argue for relatively higher perceived stress, signals that argue for relatively lower perceived stress, then a synthesis that places the participant relative to the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68).

Indicators consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Self-report symptom burden: Scores indicating elevated affective symptomatology are prominent — CES‑D = 39 (Z = +2.67, classified as depressed) and STAI‑Trait = 55 (Z = +1.35). These measures have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so the participant’s high values are strong signals that perceived stress is elevated.  
- Poor subjective sleep and sleep timing irregularity: PSQI = 10 (Z = +1.52) indicates disturbed subjective sleep quality. Median sleep start time is late (about 01:25 AM) and sleep onset variability is high (start time SD Z = +1.09), suggesting inconsistent sleep timing — a pattern often associated with higher stress and worse daytime functioning.  
- Circadian and activity fragmentation: Interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = −1.56), and amplitude from cosinor is reduced (amplitude Z = −1.04). Lower regularity and lower amplitude of heart‑rate rhythms are associated in this dataset with higher PSS (amplitude r ≈ −0.17; interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12). Intradaily variability is near the sample mean but slightly positive with PSS (IV Z ≈ 0.03; IV r ≈ 0.16), supporting some within‑day fragmentation of activity.  
- Behavioral and affective context: Low self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 25, Z = −1.85), low happiness (current = 2.0, Z = −1.61), and lower satisfaction with health (Z ≈ −1.70) are psychosocial features commonly linked to higher perceived stress. High internet and music use (Z > +2) and relatively high evening heart‑rate deviations (e.g., 5–6 pm HR deviation value 20.32, Z = +1.43) point to pronounced evening arousal or activity that may reflect compensatory behaviors or rumination in the evening hours.

Indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Low substance misuse and some social/exercise engagement: Reported use of beer and recreational/non‑prescribed drugs is “not at all” and alcohol use is only 1–2 times per week, which reduces risk for stress‑amplifying substance-related behaviors. The participant reports exercising with others 1–2 times per week (exercise with others Z ≈ +0.53) and socializing with friends 1–2 hours (Z ≈ +0.16), which are modest protective behavioral resources.  
- Physiological baseline within normative range: Resting heart rate is near the sample mean (58.2 bpm, Z ≈ +0.01), indicating no clear chronic elevation of baseline cardiovascular arousal. Median sleep duration is only mildly short (6 h 44 min, Z ≈ −0.56) rather than extremely short, and mean daily naps are rare (0.1/day), which reduces competing interpretations of extreme sleep deprivation or pathological napping.  
- Some activity regularity signals are not extreme: Intradaily variability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are near average (IV Z ≈ 0.03; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ −0.95), suggesting that while there is reduced stability, the participant’s rhythm is not completely flattened or erratic across every metric.

Physiological patterning and time‑of‑day detail
- Aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show the expected deep overnight declines (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and elevated heart rate in late afternoon/evening (notably the 5–6 PM window). The pronounced evening/late‑evening HR elevations (and the late median sleep start) point to greater physiological activation in the evening, which can correspond with delayed sleep timing and evening‑focused wakefulness or stress. The lowered cosinor amplitude and reduced interdaily stability indicate that the daily rhythm of cardiovascular activity is blunted and less consistent across days, a profile that often accompanies stress and disrupted sleep schedules. At the same time, the normal resting HR suggests absence of sustained daytime tachycardia.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population
Balancing all sources of information, the preponderance of evidence supports that this participant’s perceived stress is above the study sample mean. Rationale: markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D Z = +2.67) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = +1.35), together with poor subjective sleep (PSQI Z = +1.52), low self‑esteem, low happiness, and objective circadian irregularity (interdaily stability Z = −1.56; reduced amplitude Z = −1.04) are well‑aligned with higher PSS in this dataset. Protective factors (limited substance use, some social/exercise engagement, and normal resting heart rate) moderate but do not outweigh the multiple, converging indicators of psychological distress and disrupted rhythms. Therefore, relative to the population mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), this participant is best characterized as having perceived stress above the population mean.

Practical implications (brief)
- The profile suggests clinical attention to sleep timing and consistency, affective symptoms, and evening activation as likely leverage points for stress reduction. Interventions that stabilize sleep timing, reduce evening physiological arousal, and directly address depressive/anxious symptoms could be prioritized."
97596,"Elevated symptom burden and subjective sleep disturbance point toward higher perceived stress. The participant reports marked depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33, Z = 2.05) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56); both scales show positive associations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.27 and r ≈ 0.31, respectively), making them salient indicators that the participant experiences substantial internal distress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is very high (PSQI = 15, Z = 3.83), indicating substantial subjective sleep problems; subjective sleep disturbance commonly co-occurs with and amplifies perceived stress. Low current happiness (score = 2, Z = -1.61) and below-average self-esteem (RSES Z = -0.31, r = -0.15) further align with profiles that tend to report higher perceived stress. Wearable-derived physiology provides corroborative signs: resting heart rate is mildly elevated relative to the sample (63.6 bpm, Z = 0.65, r = 0.13), and intradaily variability of circadian activity is higher than average (IV Z = 0.81, r = 0.15), consistent with greater physiological arousal and daily rhythm fragmentation that are associated with increased perceived stress.

There are, however, behavioral and objective-sleep features that point toward potential stress-buffering resources or at least partial resilience. Objectively measured sleep duration is longer than average (median 8 h 10 min, Z = 1.22) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = -0.92), which—despite poor subjective sleep quality—can be protective for mood and stress in some contexts (sleep duration correlates weakly with lower PSS, r ≈ -0.07). The participant reports regular physical activity (exercising alone three times a week or more, Z = 1.07) and moderate social time with friends (2–3 hours, Z = 0.95); these behaviors are plausible coping resources even though their direct correlations with PSS in the sample are small. Substance use is minimal (no beer or non-prescribed/recreational drug use; infrequent wine/liquor), which reduces exposure to risk-related coping patterns. High engagement with music (listening >4 hours, Z = 2.06) may also reflect an accessible emotion-regulation strategy.

Physiological circadian features show a mixed picture that helps integrate subjective and behavioral signals. Cosinor parameters are broadly typical to slightly elevated (MESOR ≈ 77.8 bpm, Z = 0.53; amplitude near sample average, Z ≈ 0.05; acrophase ~4:14 PM), indicating a preserved overall daily rhythm. At the same time, interdaily stability is slightly below average (IS = 0.39, Z = -0.16) while intradaily variability is higher; this pattern—relatively stable overall timing but greater within-day fragmentation—can reflect irregular activity or arousal episodes across days and is modestly associated with higher perceived stress in the sample. Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs and daytime elevations, with the greatest deviations in late afternoon/evening hours; elevated daytime deviations (5–7 PM) and a modestly higher resting heart rate support the interpretation of increased physiological activation during waking hours.

Balancing the convergent indicators, the preponderance of evidence points to greater-than-average perceived stress for this participant. Clinically relevant affective symptoms (high depressive score), elevated trait anxiety, and pronounced subjective sleep disturbance are the strongest contributors to an inference of higher perceived stress; wearable markers of circadian fragmentation and mildly elevated resting heart rate provide physiological corroboration. Protective factors (long, relatively consistent objective sleep duration, regular exercise, low substance use, and social engagement) temper but do not fully offset the risk signals. Relative to the study sample mean PSS of 21.59 (SD = 3.64), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with an above-the-population-mean level of perceived stress—likely moderately elevated rather than marginal—based on the combination of psychological symptomatology, subjective sleep problems, and physiological markers described above."
57359,"Summary of self-report and trait measures:
The participant’s self-report profile is mixed but overall does not show markedly elevated symptom burden. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11, z ≈ -0.24) and trait anxiety (STAI = 39, z ≈ -0.23) are slightly below the study mean and are classified in the non-clinical range. Self-esteem (RSES = 35, z ≈ -0.45) is modestly lower than the sample mean but not extreme. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 6) crosses the common threshold for disturbed sleep, indicating participant-reported sleep difficulties despite objectively long sleep duration. Current happiness and health satisfaction are somewhat below the sample mean (happiness z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction z ≈ -0.37). Lifestyle reports show limited regular exercise (infrequent solo exercise; little group exercise), moderate social time (1–2 hours/day), above-average alcohol use frequency (beer/wine 1–2 times/week, z ≈ +1), and substantial internet use (2–3 hours/day, z ≈ +0.85).

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian profile:
Wearable data reveal a relatively low resting heart rate (52.3 bpm; z ≈ -0.70) and a robust diurnal range in heart rate (amplitude z ≈ +0.24) with a heart-rate acrophase in the mid-to-late afternoon (≈ 4:00 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show large nocturnal reductions and pronounced daytime increases, with an especially large morning elevation (8–9 AM deviation z ≈ +2.26). Non-parametric circadian measures are generally consistent with a structured daily pattern: interdaily stability is slightly above average (z ≈ +0.17) and intradaily variability is slightly below average (z ≈ -0.25), though the 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively low (z ≈ -1.03), indicating somewhat weaker day-to-day repetition of the 24-hour rhythm. Objective sleep duration is long (median 8 h 8 m; z ≈ +1.18) with modest variability between nights (SD ≈ 108 minutes).

Features that point toward higher perceived stress:
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) indicates the participant experiences poorer sleep quality despite objectively long sleep; poor perceived sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Lower self-rated happiness and slightly lower health satisfaction (both below the sample mean) are psychosocial signals that correlate with greater perceived stress in population studies.  
- Behavioral markers such as relatively high internet usage (z ≈ +0.85) and routine alcohol use (beer/wine ~1–2×/week, z ≈ +1) can be associated with stress-related coping or time-use patterns that accompany elevated perceived stress for some individuals.  
- The low 24-hour autocorrelation (z ≈ -1.03) suggests weaker consistency of the day–night heart rate pattern across days, which can reflect irregular schedules or variable stressors that undermine circadian regularity.

Features that point toward lower perceived stress:
- Trait measures of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are slightly below the sample mean, which argues against a substantially elevated chronic stress burden in this participant.  
- Objective physiological indicators are generally consistent with lower cardiovascular strain: a relatively low resting heart rate (52.3 bpm, z ≈ -0.70) and preserved amplitude of diurnal heart-rate variation support better cardiovascular fitness and autonomic regulation, factors typically associated with lower perceived stress.  
- Circadian non-parametric metrics (slightly higher interdaily stability and lower intradaily variability) indicate a reasonably structured daily routine, which is protective against high perceived stress.  
- Academic performance is strong (GPAs near the top of the scale), and recreational drug use is absent; these contextual factors conventionally align with lower chronic stress or effective functioning.

Integrated assessment and comparison to the study mean:
Taken together, the multimodal evidence is mixed but leans toward a perceived stress level that is near or somewhat below the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). Objective physiology (low resting heart rate, preserved diurnal amplitude, stable interdaily rhythm) and modestly below-average self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety scores provide the strongest signals consistent with lower perceived stress. Countervailing signals—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), reduced self-reported happiness, somewhat elevated alcohol and internet use, and reduced 24-hour rhythmic autocorrelation—indicate stress-relevant concerns that could elevate perceived stress for this individual in specific contexts. Because correlations between many individual metrics and PSS in this sample are small and because some indicators point in opposite directions, the most defensible characterization is that this participant’s perceived stress is within approximately one standard deviation of the study mean and likely near the mean or modestly below it, rather than substantially above.

Limitations and uncertainty:
Many of the individual associations with PSS are weak in this dataset, and several metrics yield conflicting implications. Objective and self-reported sleep measures diverge (long objective duration but poorer subjective quality), which increases uncertainty about sleep-related stress mechanisms. This summary therefore emphasizes probabilistic inference rather than a definitive score estimate and would be strengthened by a contemporaneous PSS score for the participant or by longitudinal trends."
17308,"Summary of multimodal findings: The participant’s profile presents a mix of behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived physiological signals that together point to a generally well-regulated lifestyle with some signs of elevated arousal vulnerability. Key self-report values include a trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) score of 43 (Z = 0.17) and a CES-D score of 12 (Z = -0.14), indicating mild-to-moderate anxiety proneness but low depressive symptom burden. Subjective sleep quality is borderline-good (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) and median sleep duration is 7 h 27 m (Z = 0.33) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = -0.84) and tightly clustered sleep start times (start-time SD Z = -1.02). Wearable physiology shows a low resting heart rate (47.2 bpm, Z = -1.30) and a relatively low mesor (60.85 bpm, Z = -1.79), with preserved diurnal amplitude (amplitude Z = 0.15) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (4:37 PM). Circadian regularity metrics are modestly reduced (interdaily stability = 0.37, Z = -0.33; autocorrelation at 24 hours Z = -0.53), indicating some diminution of day-to-day heart-rate rhythm strength despite consistent sleep timing within this recording window.

Factors that point toward relatively higher perceived stress: The participant’s elevated trait anxiety score (STAI = 43) is the strongest self-report indicator associated with higher PSS in the study context (the STAI–Trait correlates ~0.31 with PSS). Alcohol use at a frequency of 1–2 times per week (beer and wine/liquor; Z ≈ 1.0) is higher than average in the sample and can be a behavioral correlate of stress for some individuals (though the correlation with PSS here is small). Circadian rhythm summary metrics show reduced interdaily stability and lower 24-hour autocorrelation (both negative Z-scores), which can reflect weaker day-to-day regularity of physiology and has been associated with stress-related dysregulation in prior work. Finally, some intraday heart-rate deviations show relationships (albeit modest) to PSS in the study sample; the pattern of higher daytime elevations relative to the nocturnal trough in this participant may reflect greater daytime cardiovascular demand, which in some contexts aligns with elevated perceived stress.

Factors that point toward relatively lower perceived stress: Several robust protective signals are present. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12) and above-average current happiness (Happy Z = 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z = 0.8), all of which are associated with lower perceived stress in the sample. Behavioral factors that support resilience include regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07) and minimal recreational/non-prescription drug use. Objective sleep quantity and stability are favorable: median nightly sleep is adequate (≈7.5 hours) and night-to-night variability is lower than average, and naps are effectively absent. Physiologically, the low resting heart rate and low mesor (Zs = -1.30 and -1.79, respectively) suggest good cardiovascular fitness and a low baseline arousal state, which typically correspond to lower perceived stress or better physiological regulation.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows a mix of mild risk indicators (trait anxiety, somewhat elevated alcohol use, and modest reductions in circadian regularity) against a stronger set of protective signals (good objective and subjective sleep, frequent exercise, low depressive symptoms, elevated happiness and health satisfaction, and low resting heart rate). Taken together, these data are most consistent with a perceived stress level that is around the study sample mean rather than substantially above it; if forced to place the participant relative to the sample PSS distribution (population mean PSS = 21.61, SD = 3.68), the overall pattern is best characterized as near the mean. There is, however, a measurable vulnerability in trait anxiety and some circadian irregularity that could place the participant at risk for increased perceived stress under future sustained demands; conversely, current lifestyle and physiological markers suggest reasonable resilience at the time of measurement."
51851,"Summary statement: The multimodal profile contains a mixture of indicators that point in opposing directions for perceived stress. On balance, the strongest converging signals are of an individual whose trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are not elevated and who reports good health satisfaction and frequent exercise (signals associated with lower perceived stress), but who also reports disturbed subjective sleep and shows wearable-derived markers of circadian irregularity and elevated evening physiological arousal (signals associated with higher perceived stress). Compared to the study sample mean PSS (21.62), the overall pattern is most consistent with perceived stress near the population mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Subjective sleep quality is degraded: PSQI = 8 (classified as disturbed sleep; Z ≈ 0.59 relative to the cohort). Poor subjective sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress and could amplify day-to-day strain even when sleep quantity is only slightly below average.
- Circadian regularity measures indicate disrupted temporal organization. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.32, Z ≈ -0.74) and intradaily variability is relatively high (0.72, Z ≈ 1.23), a combination that reflects less consistent day-to-day schedules and more fragmented within-day activity—features that, in this dataset, correlate modestly with higher PSS (intradaily variability correlation ≈ +0.16).
- Sleep timing variability is elevated: sleep start standard deviation ≈ 111 minutes (Z ≈ 0.61), indicating inconsistent bedtimes. Irregular sleep timing tends to co-occur with higher perceived stress or with behaviors that interfere with recovery.
- Wearable heart-rate deviations show higher-than-average evening arousal: several evening hours (e.g., 6–9 pm, 10–11 pm) have positive deviations from the mesor with relatively high Z-scores (e.g., 8–9 pm Z ≈ 1.27; 10–11 pm Z ≈ 1.57). Elevated evening cardiovascular activity can reflect late-day exertion, social/academic activity, or physiological activation that may impede wind-down and sleep quality.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Trait measures of affective vulnerability are not elevated and in some cases are protective. STAI–Trait = 35 (Z ≈ -0.62) places the participant below the cohort mean on stable anxiety proneness, and CES-D = 14 (Z ≈ 0.07) does not indicate high depressive symptom burden in this sample; both of these points weigh against a markedly elevated PSS.
- Self-esteem and health satisfaction are relatively high: SelfEsteem Z ≈ +1.1 and Health Satisfaction Z ≈ +1.63. These positive self-evaluations are linked in the dataset to lower perceived stress and suggest available psychological and somatic resources.
- Behavioral supports for coping and fitness are present: frequent exercise and sports (three times per week or more; exercise-related Z-scores ≈ +1.07 to +1.58) and a very low resting heart rate (41.1 bpm, Z ≈ -2.03) suggest good cardiovascular fitness and engagement in regular physical activity—factors generally associated with lower perceived stress or better stress buffering.
- Social and recreational patterns are not strongly risk-inducing: moderate socializing (1–2 hours), limited screen-based sedentary hobbies, low recreational drug use, and only mild alcohol use frequency provide few behavioral signals of chronic high stress.

Integrative conclusion regarding perceived stress relative to the study population
When weighing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed picture: protective trait and behavioral factors (low trait anxiety, strong self-esteem, high health satisfaction, frequent exercise, low resting HR) counterbalance signals of disturbed sleep and circadian irregularity (PSQI > 5, high intradaily variability, variable sleep start times, elevated evening HR). Because several strong protective markers are present alongside moderate sleep/circadian concerns (which are themselves known to influence perceived stress but are not uniformly determinative), the overall inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is most consistent with being near the study population mean PSS (neither clearly above nor clearly below). Targeted sleep- and schedule-stabilizing interventions could be the most relevant avenues to reduce stress-related burden if the goal is to lower perceived stress relative to peers."
77872,"Summary: The multimodal profile for this participant shows a preponderance of indicators that align with relatively lower perceived stress compared with the study sample, tempered by a small set of behavioral and physiological features that plausibly elevate stress risk. Trait and symptom self-report measures (lower trait anxiety, modest depressive symptoms, and relatively high self‑esteem), objective wearable circadian metrics (robust amplitude, low intradaily variability), and a reasonably low resting heart rate each point toward a stress level below the sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). However, late habitual sleep timing, a median nightly sleep duration slightly below the sample average, reduced socializing, and evening/nighttime heart‑rate elevations suggest factors that could increase perceived stress or indicate evening arousal/behavioral misalignment. The overall balance of evidence favors an inferred PSS below the population mean, with caution because some behavioral rhythms (late sleep onset and evening autonomic activation) could raise stress under certain situational pressures.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: On self-report, trait anxiety (STAI = 33, z = -0.82) and depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 11, z = -0.24) are below the study mean and are both metrics that correlate positively with PSS in this dataset; low scores here therefore reduce the likelihood of a high PSS. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg RSES z = 0.82) and health satisfaction is elevated (z = 0.97), both of which are associated with resilience to perceived stress in the literature and in the provided correlations (RSES correlation with PSS = -0.15). Wearable circadian measures are also protective: amplitude (z = 0.75) and a low intradaily variability (z = -1.31) indicate a strong, less fragmented heart‑rate rhythm across days, and amplitude correlates negatively with PSS in the sample (corr ≈ -0.17). Resting heart rate is modestly low (57.8 bpm, z ≈ -0.04), which is consistent with better cardiovascular fitness/stress regulation and does not provide evidence of elevated chronic arousal.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress (or stress risk): Sleep timing and some behavioral patterns plausibly increase stress vulnerability. Median sleep start time (~01:58 AM) is late relative to a conventional schedule, and median nightly sleep duration (6 h 50 min, z = -0.44) is somewhat shorter than average; while PSQI score indicates generally “good” subjective sleep quality, the late timing and shortened duration can contribute to daytime strain or to cumulative stress in academic settings. Socializing is below the sample mean (z ≈ -0.62) and self‑reported current happiness is somewhat lower than average (z ≈ -0.53); lower social engagement and subjective well‑being are related to higher perceived stress in the cohort (small negative correlations reported). The hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations show notable evening and late‑night elevations (e.g., 11pm–12am and 5–6pm epochs have among the largest positive deviations from mesor, z > 1), which—given the late sleep schedule—may reflect evening arousal, late activity, or cognitive/emotional activation that could increase perceived stress or interfere with sleep onset.

Integration and holisitic conclusion relative to the sample mean: Taken together, trait measures and circadian physiology provide stronger and more consistent evidence for lower perceived stress than do the behavioral-nighttime markers for elevated stress. Given the pattern (low anxiety and depressive symptom scores, high self‑esteem and health satisfaction, robust circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability), the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62). This conclusion should be considered probabilistic rather than definitive: the late sleep timing, somewhat short sleep duration, reduced social contact, and evening autonomic activation are credible sources of stress or may precipitate stress under increased demands (e.g., exam weeks). If a more precise estimate of PSS is required, direct PSS data or repeated ecological-sampling of momentary stress would reduce uncertainty.

Key recommendations for follow‑up or interpretation: monitor whether the evening HR elevations and late sleep onset are stable features or transient (e.g., due to deadlines or social activities), and consider whether interventions that shift sleep timing earlier or increase social/recreational buffering might further lower perceived stress. The current multimodal profile supports a below‑mean PSS inference but indicates clear targets (sleep timing and evening arousal, social engagement) where changes could influence perceived stress in either direction."
72348,"Summary of features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Several wearable-derived cardiovascular metrics point to modestly elevated physiological arousal. The participant’s resting heart rate (71.2 bpm; Z = +1.55) and overall mesor from cosinor analysis (86.31; Z = +1.69) are both higher than the study sample mean, and resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14). Elevated baseline heart rate can reflect sympathetic tone or chronic physiological activation and therefore constitutes evidence that could support a higher perceived stress level. 
- Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 8; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”; Z = +0.59). Poor self-reported sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress even when total sleep time is adequate. The participant also reports somewhat lower momentary happiness (score 3.0; Z = -0.53), and lower—but not extreme—scores on measures that correlate positively with PSS (e.g., CES-D and STAI correlations with PSS are ~0.28–0.31), so any subjective distress reflected in sleep complaints and mood could contribute to higher perceived stress.

Summary of features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Multiple behavioral and circadian features indicate strong daily structure and stable sleep/wake patterns, both of which tend to associate with lower perceived stress. Interdaily stability is high (0.65; Z = +1.99) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is very high (0.62; Z = +2.49). Intradaily variability is low (0.43; Z = -0.81). These objective markers indicate consistent day-to-day rhythms and low fragmentation of activity, an overall behavioral regularity that generally aligns with lower stress vulnerability (sample correlations with PSS for interdaily stability and autocorrelation are small and negative).
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity are also in the direction of lower stress: median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 22 m; Z = +1.48) with low night-to-night variation (sleep duration SD = 39 minutes; Z = -1.40) and low variability in sleep start time (SD = 26 minutes; Z = -1.24). The participant reports essentially no daytime napping (Z = -0.86). These objective indicators of adequate and stable sleep opportunity typically support better coping and lower perceived stress.
- Self-report trait measures further favor lower perceived stress: depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 6; Z = -0.76), trait anxiety is near or slightly below the sample mean (STAI = 39; Z = -0.23), and self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 34; Z = -0.59). Low substance use and limited engagement in high-risk behaviors, plus moderate health satisfaction (Z ≈ +0.47), further reduce the behavioral risk profile for elevated perceived stress.

Integrated appraisal and relative position to the study population:
- The evidence is mixed but leans toward an overall profile of moderate-to-low perceived stress relative to this study sample. Objective circadian regularity and sleep quantity/consistency are strong and sample-relative (Zs near +2 for stability measures and +1.5 for sleep duration), and trait-level self-report measures (depression, anxiety, self-esteem) are at or below the sample mean—factors that collectively argue for lower perceived stress. Conversely, elevated resting heart rate and disturbed subjective sleep quality provide countervailing signals of physiological activation and subjective sleep-related distress that could elevate perceived stress for this individual.
- Taking the total pattern into account and given the magnitude and consistency of the circadian and sleep regularity indicators versus the more modest size of the physiological and subjective complaints, the most defensible classification relative to the study sample mean PSS (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68) is that this participant’s perceived stress is near the population mean, with a modest tendency toward being below the mean rather than above it. In other words: near the mean (perhaps slightly below), rather than clearly above it.

Limitations and caveats:
- Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the sample are generally small; hence single indicators should not be over-interpreted. Objective and subjective sleep measures point in different directions (long, regular sleep vs. self-reported poor sleep quality), and elevated resting heart rate may reflect factors other than perceived stress (fitness level, caffeine, measurement timing, or medical factors). These ambiguities reduce certainty about a precise PSS estimate.
- The conclusion above is probabilistic and should be corroborated with direct PSS measurement or further longitudinal data if precise classification is required."
89607,"Summary of multimodal profile
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures this participant shows a mixed profile: elevated affective symptomatology and some markers of physiological arousal coexist with behavioral regularity, sustained sleep duration, frequent exercise, and relatively high self‑reported self‑esteem and happiness. Key objective features include an elevated resting heart rate (68.6 bpm; Z = 1.24), a high interdaily stability of heart‑rate rhythms (0.56; Z = 1.24), low intradaily variability (0.45; Z = −0.67), a reduced circadian amplitude (9.67; Z = −0.36), and a cosinor acrophase in the late afternoon (ca. 5:14 PM). Subjective questionnaires show clinically notable depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 24; Z = 1.11) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 49; Z = 0.76), along with a PSQI indicating disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7). Median nightly sleep duration is long relative to the sample (8 h 12 min; Z = 1.26) but the typical sleep start time is very late (median 02:02 AM) with low night‑to‑night variability.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Several converging indicators point toward a higher level of perceived stress. The participant’s depressive symptom score (CES‑D = 24, Z = 1.11) and trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) are both elevated; these measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so their elevations are a salient signal for greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is also in the disturbed range (PSQI = 7), which commonly accompanies greater perceived stress. Physiologically, resting heart rate is above sample average (Z = 1.24) and hourly heart‑rate deviations show prominent daytime elevations (notably large positive deviations in the early and mid‑afternoon), which together are compatible with sustained sympathetic arousal or higher baseline cardiovascular activation; resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.14). Finally, the reduced circadian amplitude (Z = −0.36) and the late sleep timing (median sleep start ~02:02 AM) can reflect circadian misalignment or blunted day–night physiological contrast, patterns that have been associated with stress and affective symptoms in the literature.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Counterbalancing signals indicate several protective or stress‑reducing patterns. Objectively, the participant’s heart‑rate rhythm shows relatively strong interdaily stability (Z = 1.24) and low intradaily variability (Z = −0.67), implying consistent day‑to‑day structure and relatively low fragmentation of activity/physiology—features generally associated with better regulation and lower stress vulnerability (interdaily stability correlates modestly negative with PSS in the sample, r ≈ −0.11). The participant obtains a long median sleep duration (8 h 12 min; Z = 1.26) with relatively low night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD Z ≈ −0.9), which may mitigate some adverse effects of late timing. Behavioral and social resources are apparent: frequent exercise (both alone and with others; Zs > 1.0), regular socializing (1–2 hours), low substance use, high self‑esteem (RSES = 40, near the upper range; Z = 0.26) and moderately elevated current happiness (score 4.0; Z = 0.55). These factors are classically protective against perceived stress and help explain why physiological and affective signals are not uniformly elevated.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study population mean PSS
Balancing the streams of evidence, the profile is most consistent with perceived stress that is at or modestly above the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). The strongest single signals pushing toward higher perceived stress are the elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both moderately correlated with PSS) and the raised resting heart rate; these factors suggest more perceived stress than average. Protective features (strong interdaily regularity, long but stable sleep duration, regular exercise, social engagement, high self‑esteem, and low substance use) moderate that risk and argue against extremely high perceived stress. Given the magnitude of the mood and anxiety elevations (CES‑D and STAI Zs > 0.7–1.1) together with physiological arousal, the most defensible summary is “above the population mean” rather than “near” or “below,” but not extremely elevated relative to clinical extremes in the sample.

Caveats and recommended next steps
This inference synthesizes trait symptoms, subjective sleep quality, behavioral patterns, and aggregated heart‑rate rhythms; correlations provided in the dataset are modest and do not determine causality. Direct measurement of the participant’s PSS score (if available) or a follow‑up assessment would reduce uncertainty. If clinical or intervention planning is intended, targeted follow‑up focused on depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep timing/circadian alignment (given late but regular sleep), and cardiovascular indicators (elevated resting heart rate) would be appropriate avenues for further assessment."
59900,"Summary: The participant presents a mixed multimodal profile. Subjective mood and trait measures (CES-D = 13, STAI-Trait = 37, Rosenberg self-esteem = 39) lie close to or slightly better than the study mean (Z-scores near 0 or modestly negative), whereas subjective sleep disturbance is a pronounced outlier (PSQI = 14; Z = +3.37). Wearable-derived circadian features show reduced regularity and reduced amplitude (interdaily stability Z = -0.74, intradaily variability Z = -1.16, amplitude Z = -0.81, autocorrelation at 24 h Z = -1.29). Sleep quantity from the device is high (median nightly sleep 9 h 22 min; Z = +2.71) but highly variable (sleep-duration SD Z = +1.55; sleep start-time SD Z = +1.19). Taken together, these signals point to co-occurring strengths and stress-related vulnerabilities rather than a uniformly high- or low-stress profile.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The most salient indicator favoring higher perceived stress is markedly poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 14, Z = +3.37), which is well outside the sample distribution and commonly associates with elevated perceived stress. Objective sleep irregularity is also elevated: standard deviations of sleep duration (SD ≈ 169 minutes; Z = +1.55) and sleep start time (SD ≈ 137 minutes; Z = +1.19) indicate inconsistent timing and duration of sleep across days, and both of these wearable variability metrics show small positive correlations with PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.15–0.18). Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced 24-hour structure (lower interdaily stability and low autocorrelation at 24 hours, Z ≈ -0.74 and -1.29) and reduced amplitude (Z ≈ -0.81); these alterations are commonly linked to greater stress or poorer recovery in cohort analyses. Low reported physical activity (no regular exercise; exercise-frequency Z-scores ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) and relatively frequent alcohol use (beer or wine/liquor 1–2×/week; Z ≈ +1.0) are additional behavioral features that can co-occur with elevated perceived stress in student samples.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several self-report psychological measures and physiological baselines suggest less elevated perceived stress. Depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 13, Z ≈ -0.03) and trait anxiety (STAI-Trait = 37, Z ≈ -0.43) are near or below the sample mean, and self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 39, Z ≈ +0.11). Self-reported current happiness (score = 4.0, Z ≈ +0.55) and higher interpersonal trust (Z ≈ +0.83) represent psychosocial assets that typically associate with lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate (59.1 bpm, Z ≈ +0.11) is within the typical range for the sample and not elevated, and nocturnal wearable heart-rate deviations are pronouncedly negative (large night-time drops) which, given the study’s hourly correlations, are not strongly consistent with higher PSS for this participant. Social time (1–2 hours/day) is at or slightly above the sample median, which can be stress-buffering.

Physiological and circadian interpretation: The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear diurnal pattern with large negative deviations overnight (deep overnight reductions relative to the mesor) and positive deviations across the daytime, with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:37 PM). The participant’s mesor and amplitude are slightly below the sample mean (mesor Z ≈ -0.39; amplitude Z ≈ -0.81), and circadian regularity measures (interdaily stability, 24h autocorrelation) are lower than average. This combination—pronounced sleep-time heart-rate reduction but lower day–to–day rhythm stability—suggests the participant experiences distinct sleep epochs on many nights but does not maintain a strongly consistent daily schedule. In cohort analyses these circadian irregularities and reduced amplitude are modestly associated with higher PSS, whereas nocturnal heart-rate suppression itself (large negative night values) does not point strongly to elevated perceived stress in this participant.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study mean PSS: Weighing the evidence, the strongest single indicator of elevated perceived stress is the extreme subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z = +3.37) and the objectively measured irregularity of sleep timing and circadian stability. Countervailing evidence—including near-mean depressive and anxiety scores, relatively high self-esteem and reported happiness, normative resting heart rate, and substantial nightly sleep duration—mitigates against classifying the participant as markedly more stressed than peers across all domains. Overall, the balance of multimodal evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress level is likely slightly above the study population mean but not extreme. A concise comparison: inferred perceived stress is somewhat above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62), with prominent sleep-related disturbance as the principal contributor to that elevation.

Limitations: This inference integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable measures; correlations provided in the dataset are modest and do not imply causation. The participant’s actual PSS score is not listed here, so the comparison is an inference based on known associations across measures. The strongest actionable signals are poor subjective sleep quality and irregular sleep timing/circadian stability; these are the domains most likely to account for an elevated PSS relative to peers."
28254,"Overview: The participant’s multimodal profile is mixed: self-report trait measures and mood indices largely show low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and relatively high self-esteem, while wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics indicate fragmented or less-robust daily rhythms and some signs of physiological arousal. Taken together, these patterns point to competing signals about perceived stress. When weighing psychological self-report against objective sleep and circadian disruption, the balance suggests an overall perceived stress level close to the study sample mean (Population mean PSS = 21.62), with some indicators pushing modestly above average and others pushing below average.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Sleep disturbance and timing irregularity: The participant’s PSQI score of 7 (classification: disturbed sleep) and a median nightly sleep duration of 6h45m (z = -0.53) indicate subjectively poorer sleep and slightly shortened sleep quantity. Sleep start time variability is elevated (SD ≈ 122 minutes, z = 0.86) and sleep timing is late (median start ~00:50), both of which are associated in this sample with higher PSS (sleep-start variability r = 0.18). Poor subjective sleep quality and irregular bedtimes are commonly associated with increased perceived stress and may undermine daytime coping.
- Circadian regularity and amplitude: Heart-rate-derived interdaily stability is low (0.28, z = -1.07) and amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (8.37, z = -0.78). Lower interdaily stability and lower amplitude are the kinds of objective markers associated with blunted or inconsistent daily structure; in the present dataset these metrics correlate with PSS in directions suggesting that reduced regularity and amplitude are linked to higher perceived stress (e.g., amplitude correlation with PSS r ≈ -0.17). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also low (z = -0.61), consistent with less consistent day-to-day rhythm.
- Signs of modest physiological arousal: Resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the sample (61.9 bpm, z = 0.45) and several daytime hourly deviations show pronounced midday increases. Resting heart rate in this study correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.14), so a higher-than-average resting HR provides weak objective evidence toward greater perceived stress.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Low depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms and high self-esteem: Self-report measures indicate low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 6, z = -0.76) and below-average trait anxiety (STAI = 32, z = -0.92). Rosenberg self-esteem is at the top end of the scale (score = 40, z = 0.26). These psychological indicators are strongly relevant to perceived stress; lower depression/anxiety and higher self-esteem typically accompany lower PSS and reflect greater psychological resilience in many contexts.
- Stable aspects of behavior and health satisfaction: The participant reports reasonable health satisfaction (score = 5/7, z = 0.55) and low use of recreational/non-prescribed drugs. Daily napping is absent (mean daily naps = 0, z = -0.86) and variability in sleep duration across nights is relatively low (SD 45 minutes, z = -1.26). These features—especially consistent sleep duration—can be protective and correlate in this dataset with lower PSS (sleep-duration variability r = 0.14, meaning more variability relates to higher stress; here variability is low).
- Low self-reported momentary negative affect: Current happiness is somewhat below average (3.0, z = -0.53), which is a mild negative signal, but other lifestyle indices (moderate exercise, modest recreation) do not show elevations that typically accompany high-stress coping behaviors (e.g., heavy drug use is absent).

Synthesis and overall comparison to the study sample mean
- The self-report psychological profile (low CES-D and STAI scores, high self-esteem) is a robust indicator of lower perceived stress, whereas objective sleep/circadian markers (disturbed PSQI, late and irregular bedtimes, low interdaily stability and amplitude, modestly elevated resting HR) are signals that typically align with greater perceived stress. The magnitudes of these opposing signals appear similar but not equal: trait and mood measures are clearly below the sample mean for depression and anxiety (z-scores near -0.8 to -0.9), while wearable circadian measures show moderate deviations in the direction associated with higher stress (interdaily stability z ≈ -1.07; amplitude z ≈ -0.78; resting HR z ≈ +0.45; PSQI > 5).
- Given this pattern, the most defensible conclusion is that the participant’s inferred perceived stress is near the population mean PSS score, with a modest tilt toward being above the mean due to objective sleep and circadian disruption and slightly elevated resting HR. Stated succinctly: the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress is near the study sample mean (Population mean PSS = 21.62) and may be slightly above average when objective sleep/circadian signals are weighted.

Clinical- and study-relevant implications (brief)
- The combination of subjective psychological well-being and objective circadian/sleep disruption suggests a profile in which daytime coping and mood remain relatively intact despite irregular sleep timing and circadian blunting. This pattern can reflect situational or behavioral contributors to physiological dysregulation (late bedtimes, inconsistent schedules) that may raise perceived stress over time if not addressed.
- For research or intervention planning, focus on improving sleep regularity and circadian robustness (earlier, more consistent bedtimes; sleep hygiene) and monitoring resting heart rate patterns could be useful targets because they are the primary objective signals pointing toward elevated perceived stress in this participant."
35347,"Summary and overall impression
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant presents a mixed profile of risk and resilience with respect to perceived stress. Trait symptom measures (CES-D, STAI) are below the study sample mean and self-esteem is relatively high; wearable physiology shows a relatively low resting heart rate and a pronounced day–night amplitude in heart-rate rhythm. At the same time there are behavioral and subjective features that can be associated with elevated stress — notably a PSQI above the common cutoff for disturbed sleep, a markedly delayed sleep schedule (median sleep start ≈ 02:12), high day-to-day sleep-duration variability and compensatory napping, and high internet use coupled with low exercise. Integrating these signals, the pattern most consistent with the totality of evidence is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61), with neither uniformly low nor uniformly high indicators dominating the profile.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Several features in the dataset are typically associated with greater perceived stress. The participant’s PSQI score is 6 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating subjective sleep difficulties despite long sleep durations on average; disturbed subjective sleep often tracks higher perceived stress. Sleep timing is substantially delayed (median sleep start ≈ 02:12) and sleep-duration variability is elevated (SD ≈ 146 minutes, z ≈ 1.04), which together suggest an irregular or shifted sleep schedule; both late/irregular timing and high variability are linked in the literature to poorer stress regulation. The participant shows increased daytime napping (mean daily naps z ≈ 2.66) and very high internet usage (more than 4 hours per day, z ≈ 2.19), behaviors that can reflect or reinforce stress-related dysregulation of routines and coping. Low frequencies of exercise and sports (exercise measures z ≈ -1.18 to -1.09) reduce engagement in a common protective behavior for stress. Subjective well-being signals are modestly lower than the sample average (current happiness z ≈ -0.53) and reported trust of others is unusually low relative to the sample (trust z ≈ -2.07), which could reflect social factors that exacerbate perceived stress. Several wearable circadian markers show only moderate day-to-day stability (autocorrelation at 24 h z ≈ -0.36), which may reflect weaker entrainment of daily routines; measures of intradaily variability and sleep-start variability also correlate modestly with PSS in the study, consistent with risk for higher perceived stress.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Other measures point toward resilience and lower perceived stress. Trait mood and anxiety scores are low relative to the sample (CES-D score 10, z ≈ -0.34; STAI-Trait 31, z ≈ -1.02), which is a robust indicator of lower emotional symptom burden and typically corresponds to lower perceived stress. Self-esteem is relatively high (z ≈ 0.96), which usually protects against elevated stress appraisal. Objective cardiovascular indicators are reassuring: resting heart rate is low (57.8 bpm, z ≈ -0.04) and heart-rate MESOR and amplitude are modestly elevated (MESOR z ≈ 0.43; amplitude z ≈ 0.63); a larger amplitude (stronger day–night difference) correlated negatively with PSS in the sample, suggesting better circadian modulation is associated with lower stress. Median nightly sleep duration is long (≈ 8 h 29 min, z ≈ 1.61), and several daytime activities that correlate with lower PSS (high reading time with correlation ≈ -0.22) are present; academic performance (GPA ~3.74–3.77 across semesters) is high, which can reflect effective functioning and lower perceived impairment from stress. Alcohol and non-prescribed drug use are low, reducing risk from substance-related stressors.

Holistic conclusion and comparative statement
Balancing the evidence, the participant shows meaningful protective indicators (low depressive/anxiety trait scores, high self-esteem, long nightly sleep duration, low resting heart rate, pronounced circadian amplitude, strong academic performance) alongside behavioral and subjective risk markers (subjective poor sleep quality, delayed and variable sleep timing, high internet use, low exercise, low reported trust and slightly reduced happiness). Given the mix and the relative magnitudes of z-scores and known correlations with PSS, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). The profile does not consistently indicate markedly elevated perceived stress relative to the sample, nor does it show uniformly low stress; instead it reflects conditional risk that could shift higher if sleep timing, daytime routines, or social support worsen. Consideration of targeted behavioral changes (regularizing sleep timing, increasing daytime activity/exercise, and addressing subjective sleep quality) may be useful if the goal is to reduce stress-related burden or prevent escalation.

Notes on uncertainty and data interpretation
This conclusion integrates cross-sectional trait reports, subjective sleep quality, and aggregated wearable physiology. Correlations provided in the dataset are modest in magnitude, and some measures (e.g., self-esteem score scaling inconsistency) should be interpreted relative to the study sample z-scores rather than absolute cutoffs. The heart-rate hourly deviations are aggregated across days and do not speak to trends over the semester; they inform typical daily arousal patterns but not acute stress episodes."
45641,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile contains a mix of signals. Self-report instruments (CES-D = 22, z = 0.9; STAI–Trait = 46, z = 0.46; PSQI = 7) and several behavioral markers (low physical activity, low socializing, high time in sedentary hobbies, low health satisfaction) point toward increased psychological burden and behavioral patterns often seen with higher perceived stress. In contrast, wearable-derived circadian metrics (high interdaily stability z = 1.41, relatively large amplitude z = 0.81, high 24-hour autocorrelation z = 0.81), consistent nightly sleep duration (median 7 h 54 min, z = 0.89; low nap frequency), and low intradaily variability (z = -0.53) indicate a relatively regular and consolidated daily rhythm that is typically protective against stress. Overall the profile is mixed but, weighing self-report symptom elevations and behavioral risk factors more heavily, the participant’s inferred perceived stress is most consistent with being above the study population mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The participant endorses an elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D = 22, z = 0.9) and an elevated trait-anxiety score (STAI = 46, z = 0.46); both scales have positive correlations with PSS in the sample and are common contributors to higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7), self-esteem is below average (RSES = 32, z = -0.87), and health satisfaction is low (2.33, z = -1.45), each of which typically covaries with higher stress. Behavioral routines include very little exercise, minimal socializing, and a large amount of sedentary hobby time (sedentary hobby z = 2.01), patterns that are associated with reduced behavioral coping resources and elevated stress in cross-sectional data. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mesor are moderately elevated (RHR = 63.2 bpm, z = 0.6; mesor z = 0.83), which—when combined with evening HR elevations—can reflect greater tonic or evening arousal that is often observed with increased perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several wearable-derived circadian features point away from a high-stress state. Interdaily stability is high (0.58, z = 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (z = 0.81), indicating a stable day-to-day rhythm; intradaily variability is lower than the sample mean (z = -0.53), implying less fragmentation of activity and physiological arousal across the day. Sleep quantity is adequate on average (median ~7 h 54 min, z = 0.89) and sleep onset variability is not high (start-time SD z = -0.73), suggesting consistent sleep timing despite a late median bed time (~01:59). These markers (stable circadian organization, consistent sleep duration) are typically associated with better stress resilience and lower perceived stress.

Interpretation of heart-rate timing and sleep timing: The participant’s median sleep start is late (around 02:00), and aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated evening and late-night heart rates (notably 9–11 pm and midnight–1 am elevations with relatively high z-scores). This pattern is consistent with an evening-typed schedule and measurable physiological activation in the late evening. While adequate total sleep duration and low night-to-night variability mitigate risk, the late timing and evening arousal could interfere with subjective sleep quality and daytime emotion regulation, and may partly underlie the elevated self-reported sleep disturbance (PSQI) and affective symptoms.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Considering the balance of evidence — moderate-to-strong self-reported symptom elevations (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, disturbed sleep), behavioral risk factors (low exercise and socializing, high sedentary time), and modest physiological signs of arousal — the participant’s inferred perceived stress is most consistent with being above the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68). The wearable circadian stability and adequate sleep duration temper this interpretation, suggesting the elevation in perceived stress is likely moderate rather than extreme and may be driven primarily by affective and behavioral factors rather than gross circadian disruption or severe sleep restriction."
64572,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mix of generally adaptive psychological and behavioral characteristics together with some sleep-related and evening-arousal signals that could elevate perceived stress. On balance, the profile is more consistent with perceived stress below the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61) than with markedly elevated stress, although specific sleep and evening physiology findings warrant attention as potential contributors to subjective strain.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress (factors that would push PSS upward)
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The participant’s PSQI score is 6 (above the common clinical cut-point of 5), indicating clinically meaningful disturbed sleep in the prior month. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 hr 38 min; Z = -0.69), and the typical sleep start time is late (around 00:42), which together can impair recovery and increase perceived stress even when other mood measures are low.
- Evening physiological activation: Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced positive deviations in the evening (notably 7–9 pm; the 8–9 pm deviation = +23.6, Z = 2.47), indicating higher-than-mesor cardiovascular activation in the evening hours. Elevated evening arousal can interfere with wind-down and sleep onset and is plausibly linked to momentary worry or engaging activities that impede rest.
- Lower self-rated momentary well-being and health satisfaction: Self-rated current happiness is below the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53) and health satisfaction is modest (Z = -0.45). These subjective appraisals can reflect situational strain that contributes to higher perceived stress.
- Sleep timing variability: Sleep start time standard deviation (~55 minutes; Z = -0.61 but correlation with PSS = 0.17) suggests some night-to-night variability; greater irregularity in sleep timing is associated with higher perceived stress in the literature and in the modest positive correlation here.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress (factors that would push PSS downward)
- Low depressive and trait-anxiety symptom reports: CES-D score is low (4.0, Z = -0.97) and STAI–Trait is below the sample mean (35.0, Z = -0.62). These lower symptom levels suggest reduced chronic negative affect, a pattern typically associated with lower perceived stress.
- High circadian regularity and preserved rhythm amplitude: Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms is relatively high (value = 0.61, Z = 1.66), and cosinor-derived amplitude is moderately elevated (Z = 0.49). High interdaily stability and measurable amplitude are generally linked to routine and temporal structure, which are protective against elevated perceived stress.
- Low resting heart rate and other fitness-like features: Resting heart rate is low (50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93), which can reflect good cardiovascular fitness or lower basal sympathetic tone and is modestly associated in this dataset with lower PSS risk.
- Healthy lifestyle indicators: The participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use, regular (if not daily) exercise and sports participation (exercise/sports Z-scores near or above the mean), and at least moderate social time (socializing ~1–2 hours). These behavioral supports are typically associated with lower perceived stress.
- Self-esteem and trust: Reported self-esteem is above average (Z = 0.54) and trust in others is elevated (Z = 0.83). Higher self-esteem and social trust are psychosocial resources that buffer against perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Taking the balance of evidence together, the participant’s pattern more strongly reflects factors associated with lower perceived stress than with higher perceived stress. Low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high interdaily stability of physiological rhythms, low resting heart rate, absence of substance use, and above-average self-esteem point toward perceived stress below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). Countervailing signals—subjective disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), relatively short sleep duration, late sleep timing, and notable evening cardiovascular activation—could elevate momentary or situational stress and may modestly increase the participant’s PSS relative to otherwise favorable indices. Overall, and given the relative magnitudes of these signals, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is likely below the population mean rather than at or above it.

Important caveats
- No actual PSS score for this participant was provided; this interpretation integrates multiple correlated indicators rather than direct PSS measurement. Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the study are generally modest, so inferences are probabilistic rather than definitive.
- Wearable heart-rate metrics are temporally aggregated and do not substitute for context-specific measures of stress reactivity. Evening heart-rate elevations could reflect stimulating activities (exercise, socializing, gaming) as well as stress; survey data indicate evening activities (e.g., video games use above average) that could explain some of the pattern.
- The PSQI and sleep timing findings suggest a potential target for intervention (improving sleep regularity and duration); addressing sleep could further reduce perceived stress even in the context of generally favorable mental-health scores.

If desired, next steps could include obtaining the participant’s actual PSS score, time-resolved context for evening arousal (activity logs), or a short sleep hygiene intervention to test whether improving sleep reduces perceived stress indicators."
28312,"High-perceived-stress indicators: The self-report profile contains several features that point toward elevated perceived stress. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66), and this trait measure has a moderate positive association with PSS in the study sample (r ≈ 0.31), which increases the likelihood that this participant experiences above-average stress. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05), a pattern that commonly tracks with higher perceived stress and with other internalizing symptoms; depressive symptom level is modestly elevated (CES-D = 14, Z ≈ 0.07) and also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28). Low frequency of exercise (exercising 1–2 times a month; sports: not at all; exercise Z-scores negative) and modest self-esteem (RSES = 35, Z = -0.45) are additional behavioral/trait features that, in population analyses, tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress (though correlations in this dataset are small-to-moderate). Taken together, the subjective report of disturbed sleep, elevated trait anxiety, and limited regular physical activity provide converging self-report evidence consistent with a tendency toward higher perceived stress.

Low-perceived-stress indicators (wearable and behavioral): Several objective wearable-derived measures and behavioral indicators point in the opposite direction, consistent with relatively lower perceived stress. Nighttime heart rate shows a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest deviations from mesor between ~3:00–5:00 AM reaching about -21 to -23 bpm), and the circadian profile is robust: high MESOR (83.44, Z = 1.30) and particularly high amplitude (15.54, Z = 1.54), along with strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 0.90) and modestly positive interdaily stability (0.45, Z = 0.33). In this sample these features (greater amplitude and stronger day-to-day regularity) tend to be associated with lower PSS (correlations are modestly negative, e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.17; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17). Median sleep duration is adequate to slightly above average (7 h 35 m, Z = 0.51), and sleep start time variability is relatively low (sleep start SD Z = -0.54), both of which can reflect behavioural regularity that is protective against higher perceived stress. Resting heart rate (61.7 bpm, Z = 0.42) is within a typical range and does not provide strong evidence of sustained autonomic arousal. Overall, the objective physiology indicates a relatively regular circadian pattern and robust nocturnal recovery, characteristics that, in aggregate, are more typical of lower perceived stress.

Synthesis and balanced interpretation: The dataset therefore presents a mixed but interpretable pattern. Self-report measures emphasize internal states associated with greater distress (notably trait anxiety and subjectively poor sleep), while wearable-derived physiology indicates preserved circadian structure and substantial nocturnal cardiovascular recovery—objective signals that normally align with lower perceived stress. The magnitude of the associations differs: the strongest single self-report signal is trait anxiety (which correlates moderately with PSS), whereas the wearable features most strongly associated with lower PSS (amplitude, 24-h autocorrelation) show modest negative correlations. Behavioral risk factors (low exercise frequency, some alcohol use at 1–2 times/week) add incremental risk but are not large effects in the present sample.

Overall conclusion relative to the study mean: Considering both sources of evidence, the preponderance of self-report indicators that directly map onto subjective distress (especially elevated trait anxiety and poor subjective sleep) suggests that this participant’s perceived stress is likely above the population mean rather than below it. Given the countervailing objective evidence of physiological regularity and recovery, the most defensible categorical statement is that the participant’s inferred PSS is somewhat above the study sample mean (sample mean PSS = 21.61), but not extremely elevated; in other words, above the population mean but not at the extreme high end of the distribution. This conclusion reflects the combination of moderate-to-strong self-reported anxiety and sleep disturbance together with protective objective circadian physiology, and should be interpreted with the caveat that objective and subjective signals point in opposite directions and that definitive classification would require the participant’s actual PSS score or longitudinal corroboration."
56805,"Summary and overall impression
The participant’s multimodal profile contains a mixture of objective signatures of circadian/sleep irregularity and robust self-report indicators of low mood and anxiety. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence from validated questionnaires (very low CES-D and STAI scores, high self-esteem and self-reported happiness, good PSQI) and healthy behavioral habits (minimal substance use, regular exercise and social activity, high health satisfaction) points to an overall perceived stress level that is below the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). Objective wearable signals introduce some cautionary features—particularly markedly short nightly sleep and reduced day-to-day circadian stability—but these do not, in this dataset, outweigh the strong, convergent self-report indicators of lower perceived stress.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Short objective sleep duration: Median nightly sleep of 5 h 33 min (Z = -2.02) is substantially below the sample average. Short sleep duration is commonly associated with higher perceived stress and poorer recovery even when subjective sleep quality is endorsed as acceptable.  
- Late and somewhat variable sleep timing: A median sleep start near 01:20 AM and a non-negligible standard deviation in start time (~54 minutes) indicate a late schedule and some timing variability; irregular sleep timing tends to co-occur with higher stress and worse daytime functioning.  
- Reduced circadian regularity: Interdaily stability (0.30, Z = -0.9) and low 24-hour autocorrelation (0.23, Z = -0.78) indicate less rigid day-to-day structure in heart-rate rhythms. Lower interdaily stability has been associated in group-level analyses with higher PSS in this study.  
- Wearable-derived early-morning heart-rate deviations: Deeper-than-average nocturnal heart-rate drops (large negative deviations 2–5 AM) followed by sharper morning rises have modest positive correlations with PSS at several pre-dawn/early-morning hours (correlations around 0.19–0.21), an objective pattern sometimes linked to sleep fragmentation, sleep debt, or heightened physiological arousal on waking.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Very low depressive and anxiety symptom scores: CES-D = 1 (Z ≈ -1.28) and STAI-Trait = 20 (Z ≈ -2.11) are both far below sample means and are strong indicators of low self-reported distress and chronic anxiety proneness—measures that correlate positively with PSS in the study.  
- High psychosocial resources and well-being: Elevated self-esteem (RSES Z = +1.66), high self-reported happiness (Z = +1.64), and high health satisfaction (Z = +2.05) are each associated with lower PSS in the sample (negative score correlations) and suggest psychological resilience and positive subjective functioning.  
- Healthy lifestyle behaviors: The participant reports minimal substance use, frequent exercise (including social exercise and sports at or above three times/week), and regular socializing—behaviors that are typically protective against perceived stress.  
- Favorable cardiovascular baseline: Resting heart rate is low (44.2 bpm, Z = -1.66), which is consistent with higher aerobic fitness in many individuals and may reflect lower tonic sympathetic activation; in this sample higher resting heart rate is modestly associated with greater PSS, so the observed low RHR is a protective signal.  
- Subjective sleep quality: PSQI score of 4 (classified as “good sleep,” Z ≈ -1.26) suggests that despite short objective sleep duration the participant perceives their sleep quality as acceptable, and subjective sleep quality is a stronger proximal correlate of perceived stress than duration in many contexts.

Integration and conclusion relative to the study mean PSS
When weighing objective and subjective data together, the strongest and most directly stress-related signals in this participant favor lower perceived stress: minimal depressive/anxiety symptoms, robust self-esteem and happiness, healthy behaviors, and low resting heart rate. The principal objective concerns—short objective sleep duration and reduced interdaily circadian stability—are meaningful risk factors that could elevate stress over time or under increased demands, but their correlations with PSS in this dataset are modest and are counterbalanced by the multiple, large-magnitude protective self-report indicators. Therefore the most parsimonious inference is that the participant’s perceived stress level is below the study sample mean (i.e., “below the population mean” of 21.62), though not without specific behavioral targets (notably sleep duration and schedule regularity) that could change that status if they worsen.

Uncertainty and recommended monitoring
This interpretation should be seen as probabilistic rather than definitive. Key uncertainties include the discrepancy between short objective sleep and good subjective sleep quality, and whether circadian irregularity is transient (e.g., semester-related) or chronic. For stronger inference, repeated PSS measurement and closer monitoring of nightly sleep duration and timing would clarify whether the objective sleep and circadian features begin to drive increases in perceived stress over time."
26800,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of signals relevant to perceived stress. Several physiological and self-report indicators (notably low resting heart rate, modest depressive symptom score, good subjective sleep quality, and elevated self-esteem) point toward relatively lower perceived stress, whereas aspects of circadian organization and sleep timing (low interdaily stability, low circadian amplitude, and a late typical sleep onset) and a non-trivial trait anxiety score provide countervailing evidence that would be expected to relate to greater perceived stress. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress level is near — and likely slightly below — the study sample mean PSS score (population mean = 21.62), rather than markedly above it.

Evidence indicating relatively higher perceived stress
- Circadian regularity and amplitude: The participant shows reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ −0.9) and low interdaily stability (value 0.30, z ≈ −0.9). In this sample these features are modestly associated with higher PSS (correlations ≈ −0.17 for amplitude and −0.12 for interdaily stability, where lower amplitude/stability generally relates to greater stress). Reduced amplitude and day-to-day irregularity of heart-rate rhythms suggest less robust physiological circadian structure, which is commonly linked to greater perceived stress or poorer stress regulation.
- Late and variable sleep timing: The median sleep start time of about 01:28 (SD ≈ 89 minutes) indicates late and somewhat variable bedtimes. Later and irregular sleep timing can undermine circadian alignment and has been associated with greater perceived stress in some studies; the sleep-start variability correlation with PSS in the dataset is small but positive (≈ 0.17).
- Trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score (40) is near the sample average but classified as “anxious”; STAI scores in this dataset correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Even a moderate level of trait anxiety increases the likelihood of higher perceived stress in stressful contexts.
- Behavioral patterns consistent with potential stressors: Low frequency of exercising alone or with others (z-scores ≈ −1.2 to −1.6) and limited engagement in sedentary or recreational buffering activities (e.g., little TV, music, reading) may reduce opportunities for stress reduction or social support, which could contribute to higher perceived stress over time.

Evidence indicating relatively lower perceived stress
- Low resting heart rate and lower mesor: Resting HR is quite low (≈49.4 bpm, z ≈ −1.04), and the mesor is reduced (z ≈ −0.91). In this sample higher resting heart rate is modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.14), so the participant’s low resting HR is consistent with relatively lower perceived stress or better cardiovascular fitness and autonomic balance.
- Depressive symptoms and sleep quality: CES-D score is low (7.0; z ≈ −0.66), indicating few depressive symptoms; CES-D correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), so a low depressive score points toward lower perceived stress. The PSQI total is 5.0 (z ≈ −0.8), classified as “good sleep” in the dataset’s framing; subjectively better sleep quality also tends to relate to lower perceived stress.
- Self-esteem and functional indicators: Elevated self-esteem (RSES z ≈ +0.96) is associated in the sample with lower PSS (r ≈ −0.15), and the participant’s academic performance is strong (GPAs in the high 3.8–3.9 range). These psychosocial and functional strengths support resilience against perceived stress.
- Temporal regularity at the 24-hour autocorrelation: The participant’s autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively elevated (z ≈ +0.64) and in the dataset this metric relates to lower PSS (r ≈ −0.17). This suggests there remains some stable day-to-day patterning in heart-rate rhythms despite lower interdaily stability on other metrics.

Integrated conclusion
The participant presents a mixed profile but overall leans toward lower perceived stress relative to the sample mean. Protective features—low resting heart rate, few depressive symptoms, good subjective sleep quality, elevated self-esteem, and strong academic functioning—carry meaningful weight and are associated in this dataset with lower PSS. Countervailing signs (reduced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, late and variable sleep timing, limited exercise frequency, and a non-trivial trait anxiety score) indicate vulnerabilities that could raise perceived stress, particularly under increased demand or when circadian disruption accumulates. On balance, I infer the participant’s perceived stress is near to slightly below the study population mean PSS of 21.62.

Implication / recommendation
Given the mixed signals, the most actionable targets to reduce potential stress vulnerability are circadian regularity and sleep timing: promoting an earlier, more consistent sleep schedule and modest increases in routine physical activity could strengthen circadian amplitude and interdaily stability and may reduce perceived stress risk even further. Monitoring trait anxiety and maintaining psychosocial supports and good sleep hygiene are other reasonable strategies to sustain the lower-stress profile indicated by cardiovascular and mood measures."
47142,"Summary and high‑stress–related indicators:
Several self‑report and physiological features are consistent with a tendency toward elevated perceived stress. On symptom measures, the participant’s CES‑D score (19; Z = 0.59) and STAI‑Trait score (43; Z = 0.17) are above the study sample mean and have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), indicating that depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety are likely contributing to higher perceived stress. Self‑esteem is below average (RSES = 35; Z = −0.45) and self‑reported happiness and health satisfaction are below the sample mean (happiness Z = −0.53; health satisfaction Z = −0.95), both of which are negatively associated with well‑being and, in this sample, related modestly to higher PSS. Physiologically, resting heart rate and overall heart‑rate mesor are elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 65.1 bpm, Z = 0.83; mesor Z = 1.32), and resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), which can reflect greater tonic autonomic arousal associated with stress. Behavioral indicators that commonly accompany stress — a relatively late median sleep onset (01:39) and a median nightly sleep duration below typical recommendations (6 h 32 min; Z = −0.81) combined with an elevated frequency of short daytime naps (mean daily naps 0.3; Z = 2.66) — also point toward sleep timing/quantity patterns that can co‑occur with increased perceived stress.

Low‑stress–related indicators:
At the same time, multiple features in the dataset point away from high perceived stress and toward stability and behavioral protection. The participant reports good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4; Z = −1.26), which typically corresponds to fewer sleep‑related complaints and lower stress burden. Wearable‑derived circadian metrics indicate relatively strong, regular daily structure: high interdaily stability (0.54; Z = 1.08), high autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.50; Z = 1.48), and low intradaily variability (0.36; Z = −1.31). These rhythm metrics are associated in this sample with lower PSS (interdaily stability and autocorrelation correlations with PSS are negative: r ≈ −0.12 and r ≈ −0.17, respectively), suggesting consistent day‑to‑day routines that can buffer perceived stress. Lifestyle factors that tend to be protective are present as well: the participant reports no alcohol or recreational drug use (large negative Z‑scores for use) and maintains good academic performance historically (high GPAs), which can reduce stress exposure or its perceived impact. The participant also reports at least some regular solitary exercise (1–2 times/week), and low engagement in potentially stress‑exacerbating recreational habits (very low TV/gaming/socializing), which may indicate a structured, low‑distraction routine.

Behavioral‑physiological detail and integration:
The wearable hourly heart‑rate profile and cosinor metrics indicate a coherent diurnal pattern with an acrophase in the late afternoon/early evening (approximately 5:06 PM) and expected nocturnal heart‑rate dips (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–6:00 AM). Those nocturnal reductions in aggregated heart rate are pronounced and consistent with preserved nighttime physiological downregulation. Intraday variability is low and day‑to‑day rhythmicity is high, which together point to a relatively stable circadian organization of activity and autonomic state across the semester. However, the elevated aggregate mesor and modestly higher resting heart rate indicate somewhat elevated baseline cardiovascular activation even in the context of regular rhythms. The late sleep timing and higher nap frequency suggest a shifted sleep‑wake schedule and some daytime sleepiness or compensatory behavior, which may reflect lifestyle choices (late schedule) rather than fragmented sleep per se given the good PSQI and relatively stable sleep start time variability (SD ≈ 69 min; Z ≈ −0.31).

Holistic conclusion about perceived stress versus the study population:
Weighing convergent evidence, the participant exhibits a mixture of signals — moderate elevations in mood‑ and anxiety‑related self‑report measures and slightly elevated resting cardiovascular tone that pull in the direction of greater perceived stress, while objective circadian regularity, good subjective sleep quality, low substance use, and strong academic performance pull in the opposite direction. Because the symptom measures that most strongly correlate with PSS (depressive symptoms and trait anxiety) are modestly above average but physiological and behavioral rhythm metrics are relatively protective and strongly deviate from the sample mean in the protective direction (high interdaily stability and autocorrelation), the overall pattern is best characterized as near the study sample mean for perceived stress, with a slight tendency toward higher perceived stress rather than markedly elevated. In summary: the participant’s inferred perceived stress is near the population mean (21.62), with mixed indicators that suggest vulnerability to modestly higher stress but also meaningful behavioral and circadian resiliencies that likely moderate that risk."
60396,"Overview: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mixture of risk and protective features for perceived stress. Trait anxiety is mildly elevated (STAI = 42, Z ≈ 0.07) while depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55). Wearable-derived physiology indicates a low overall cardiac tone (MESOR ≈ 65.8 bpm, resting heart rate ≈ 49.4 bpm; both Z ≈ -1.1), consistent with relatively good cardiovascular conditioning. Behavioral measures show generally adequate sleep duration (median 7 h 23 m, Z = 0.26) but a late habitual sleep onset (median start ~01:46) and a PSQI >5 (score = 6) indicating subjective sleep disturbance. Circadian regularity metrics are mixed but overall relatively structured (autocorrelation at 24 hours Z = +1.57; interdaily stability slightly below average Z = -0.24; intradaily variability notably low Z = -1.45).

Features that point toward greater perceived stress: Several indicators align with factors that often accompany higher perceived stress. The participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6), and the late median sleep start time (01:46) suggests a delayed sleep schedule or circadian misalignment; both disturbed sleep and late/irregular timing are commonly associated with elevated stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 42) is above the sample mean and correlates positively with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31), which supports an association between the participant’s anxiety proneness and perceived stress. Some heart-rate–derived features during the overnight and early-morning hours (e.g., less pronounced nocturnal decline in certain early hours and small positive correlations of early-morning deviations with PSS, r ≈ 0.14–0.21) also align with patterns in which nocturnal physiology relates to higher stress. Lastly, reduced daytime socializing (self-reported social time lower than sample mean) and relatively frequent alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ +1.0) could reflect behavioral contexts that co-occur with, or maintain, higher perceived stress for some individuals.

Features that point toward lower perceived stress: Several objective and self-reported factors are protective or associated with lower stress. The participant’s depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 8), overall happiness and health satisfaction are above the sample mean (happiness Z ≈ +0.55; health satisfaction Z ≈ +0.88), and trust of others is relatively high (Z ≈ +1.15), each of which tends to correspond with lower perceived stress. Wearable circadian metrics indicate strong day-to-day rhythmicity (high autocorrelation at 24 h, Z ≈ +1.57) and low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ -1.45), both of which are typically protective against elevated stress. The participant’s resting heart rate and MESOR are low (Z ≈ -1.0 to -1.1), suggesting cardiovascular fitness, and they report regular group-based exercise (exercising with others three+ times/week, Z ≈ +1.23), a behavior linked to reduced perceived stress. Nightly sleep duration is adequate on average (≈7 h 23 m) and sleep-duration variability is not elevated (SD ≈ 70 min, Z ≈ -0.69), which are also supportive of lower stress.

Interpretation of circadian and wearable heart-rate patterns: The participant’s heart-rate rhythm shows a typical large nocturnal trough and an evening peak (acrophase ~5:52 PM), with particularly elevated deviations in the 7–9 pm window relative to the mesor (Zs up to ≈ +1.6). Evening elevation coupled with a late sleep onset suggests the participant is physiologically more active or aroused in the late evening, which may contribute to the subjective sleep disturbance. At the same time, the strong 24-h autocorrelation and low intradaily variability indicate consistent daily structure across the recording period—an objective marker that generally mitigates stress risk. Correlations between many of these objective rhythm measures and PSS in this sample are small-to-moderate and mixed in direction; therefore these physiological patterns should be interpreted as contributors to, but not sole determinants of, perceived stress.

Holistic conclusion relative to the sample mean PSS: Considering the combination of mildly elevated trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance on the one hand, and multiple protective signals (low depressive symptoms, good subjective happiness and health satisfaction, strong circadian regularity, low resting heart rate, and regular group exercise) on the other, the participant’s overall profile most consistently aligns with a perceived stress level near the study population mean. In other words, the inferred perceived stress is neither strongly elevated nor clearly below average; “near the population mean” (population mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68) best summarizes the balance of evidence. The data identify two targets that could shift perceived stress upward (late sleep timing/subjective sleep problems and trait anxiety) and several stabilizing factors that likely buffer stress (cardiorespiratory fitness, structured daily rhythms, social exercise, reported happiness/health satisfaction)."
92412,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable measures, the participant presents a pattern of generally favorable mood, low symptom burden, and regular sleep and activity that together point toward lower-than-average perceived stress. Self-reports show very low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07), relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 32, Z = -0.92), high momentary happiness (current = 5, Z = 1.64), and good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4, Z = -1.26). Wearable-derived physiology is concordant with this picture: resting heart rate is low (53 bpm, Z = -0.61), median nightly sleep is slightly longer than the study mean (7 h 48 m, Z = 0.76) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z = -0.87; sleep-start SD Z = -0.74), and there are clear nocturnal heart-rate nadirs (large negative deviations during the 2–7 AM hours). Regular exercise is reported (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more, Z ≈ 1.1–1.2), academic performance is uniformly high, and substance use is minimal — all features that are typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
A small number of behavioral and circadian features are either positively correlated with PSS in this sample or are suggestive of circadian fragmentation that can accompany stress. Intradaily variability (0.66; Z = 0.81) is elevated relative to the sample and shows a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.17); higher intradaily variability indicates more fragmentation between rest and activity across the day and has been linked to higher stress in group-level data. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.29; Z = -0.28), and interdaily stability is only moderate (0.43; Z = 0.17), which together indicate that the heart-rate circadian structure is not maximally rigid — a pattern that can be seen in individuals experiencing some day-to-day variability in routine or stressors. The hourly aggregate heart-rate profile shows a very large positive deviation from the mesor at 5–6 PM (value = +39.22; Z = 4.19) and elevated evening heart rate more broadly; while this likely reflects repeated strenuous activity or exercise in the late afternoon/early evening (consistent with self-reported frequent exercise), sustained evening physiological arousal can, in some contexts, interfere with wind-down and has small sample correlations to stress for some hourly windows. Finally, several individual wearable correlations with PSS are small but in the direction of elevated stress (e.g., some nighttime-to-morning HR deviations have small positive correlations with PSS).

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Multiple strong indicators point toward lower perceived stress. Self-report mental health measures (CES-D and STAI) are well below the study mean (both roughly one standard deviation or more below), subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI below the common clinical threshold, Z = -1.26), and self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are above average. Behavioral markers that typically protect against stress are present: consistent and frequent exercise, minimal substance use, no daytime napping, stable and adequate nightly sleep duration with low variability, and very low sedentary/leisure time by self-report. Physiologically, a low resting heart rate and pronounced nocturnal heart-rate declines (large negative deviations during typical sleep hours) are consistent with adequate recovery overnight. The cosinor amplitude is above average (amplitude = 13.08, Z = 0.74) and amplitude correlates negatively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.16); higher amplitude usually indicates stronger day–night contrast in physiology, which is generally associated with lower perceived stress.

Holistic conclusion (comparison to study population)
Weighing the totality of evidence, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level below the study population mean. The strongest, most directly relevant indicators (very low depressive symptoms, below-average trait anxiety, good subjective sleep, high happiness, regular exercise, low resting HR, and sleep regularity) point toward lower perceived stress; only modest circadian fragmentation (elevated intradaily variability) and evening physiological elevation temper that conclusion. Relative to the study sample mean PSS of 21.63 (SD = 3.67), the preponderance of data suggests the participant’s perceived stress would fall below the population mean rather than near or above it.

Limitations and caveats
This inference integrates trait questionnaires, momentary self-report, and aggregated wearable physiology, but it is not a direct PSS measurement for this individual. Several correlation coefficients between individual features and PSS in the sample are small, and some wearable signals (e.g., large evening HR spikes) likely reflect healthy behaviors (exercise) rather than stress per se. Conversely, elevated intradaily variability is a small but notable signal that could reflect situational variability in routine or transient stressors that are not captured by the trait scales. Therefore the conclusion of below-mean perceived stress is probabilistic and should be interpreted in the context of these measurement limitations."
92038,"Summary and comparison to the study population
Based on the available multimodal data, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the participant’s overall perceived stress level is likely below the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). Multiple self-report measures that correlate with perceived stress (notably the CES-D and STAI trait scales, and positive indicators such as self-esteem and current happiness) are well outside the sample mean in directions associated with lower stress, and wearable-derived markers that strongly track daily physiological stress (e.g., resting heart rate, amplitude) are generally consistent with relatively low chronic arousal. Taken together, these signals make it more likely that this participant’s perceived stress is below, rather than at or above, the sample mean.

Key evidence consistent with relatively low perceived stress
Several self-report measures that are moderately predictive of PSS show patterns associated with lower stress: CES-D = 2.0 (z = -1.18; classified as not depressed) and STAI–Trait = 31 (z = -1.02; classified as not anxious). High self-esteem (Rosenberg z = +1.66) and high self-reported current happiness (z = +1.64) also align with lower PSS, and these variables have modest negative correlations with PSS in the sample (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15, happiness r ≈ -0.19). Behavioral habits that typically protect against stress are present: frequent exercise alone and with others (both z > +1), low use of recreational/non-prescribed drugs, and good academic performance (GPA values high). Physiologically, the participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (53.4 bpm, z = -0.56), consistent with fitness and lower tonic autonomic arousal. Median nightly sleep duration is adequate (7 h 36 min, z = +0.52), which is typically protective against higher perceived stress. Collectively these findings—especially the low depression/anxiety scores and high self-esteem/happiness—carry substantive weight because they are directly correlated with PSS in this sample (r’s in the 0.28–0.31 range for CES-D and STAI).

Key evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
There are several wearable-derived and self-report signals that point toward factors which can accompany elevated perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is mildly disturbed (PSQI = 6, just above the common clinical cutoff), and sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep start ~01:27 with a high SD of 114 min, z ≈ +0.69) and a high night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD z = +1.0); these instability indices correlate positively with PSS in the sample (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.17; sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.14). Circadian rhythm metrics show reduced regularity: interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.39, z ≈ -0.16) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.22, z ≈ -0.87), while intradaily variability (fragmentation) is elevated (0.72, z ≈ +1.23). Intradaily variability and other rhythm irregularity measures have modest positive correlations with PSS (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), indicating that circadian fragmentation and inconsistent timing could contribute to higher perceived stress. Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations show relatively large afternoon/evening elevations (peaks around 3–5 pm with z-scores above +2.0 and some elevated early-night values), which could reflect sustained daytime physiological activation or late-evening arousal; some of these hourly deviations show small positive correlations with PSS (up to ~0.19). Finally, the PSQI classification (disturbed sleep) provides a subjective signal that aligns with the wearable indicators of irregular sleep timing and fragmentation.

Integrated interpretation and relative weighting
When the different data modalities are balanced, the strongest and most direct indicators of perceived stress in this dataset are the self-report affective and trait measures (CES-D, STAI, self-esteem, current happiness), all of which are substantially shifted in directions associated with lower perceived stress and have moderate sample correlations with PSS. Wearable signals indicating circadian irregularity and intraday fragmentation do represent legitimate risk factors for higher perceived stress, but their correlations with PSS in this sample are smaller and the absolute magnitudes are mixed (some circadian metrics favorable, others unfavorable). Physiological fitness-related signals (low resting heart rate, high daytime amplitude) and protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance misuse, adequate median sleep duration) further tip the balance toward a lower inferred PSS. Therefore, the most parsimonious conclusion is that this participant’s perceived stress is likely below the sample mean PSS (i.e., below 21.62), though not uniformly low across all indices—circadian irregularity and sleep timing variability represent identifiable vulnerabilities that could elevate subjective stress in contexts of academic demand or acute disturbance.

Implications and caution
The inference that the participant’s PSS is below the sample mean is probabilistic rather than definitive: strong protective self-report signals make lower stress the likeliest state, but wearable-derived circadian fragmentation and subjective sleep disturbance point to mechanisms that could increase perceived stress under challenge. If the goal is to monitor or reduce perceived stress, attention to regularizing sleep timing and reducing intradaily fragmentation (e.g., more consistent sleep/wake schedules, evening winding-down routines) could be logical next targets, given their modest associations with PSS in this sample."
86440,"Summary statement
Across the available self-report and wearable-derived measures the balance of evidence points to this participant having a perceived stress level that is below the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). Trait symptom scores that typically covary with perceived stress (STAI trait = 38, Z = -0.33; CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) are modestly lower than the sample average, self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17), and several objective physiological and behavioral markers (resting heart rate = 51 bpm, Z = -0.85; 24-hour autocorrelation Z = +0.48; low substance use) align with comparatively lower stress. Below I outline the specific features that point toward higher perceived stress and those that point toward lower perceived stress, followed by an integrative interpretation and caveats.

Features that suggest relatively higher perceived stress
- Subjective sleep quality is worse than typical: PSQI = 7 (classified as disturbed sleep; Z = +0.13). Poorer subjective sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress and with PSS in this sample-level data. 
- Some markers of within-day behavioral fragmentation are slightly elevated: intradaily variability is modestly above average (value 0.56, Z = +0.10) and sleep duration variability is nontrivial (SD ≈ 94 minutes). Elevated intradaily variability and variable sleep duration tend to correlate positively with PSS in the cohort and may reflect daily schedule demands or arousals. 
- Several hourly heart-rate deviations in the early morning show larger negative departures from the mesor (e.g., 3–7am) that have small positive correlations with PSS in this sample; while these are physiologically consistent with nocturnal quiescence, the pattern in aggregated deviations has modest associations with higher PSS in the cohort. 
- The participant’s sleep start time is relatively late (median start ≈ 00:50), which can interact with academic and social schedules to increase perceived time pressure or fatigue in some contexts.

Features that suggest relatively lower perceived stress
- Trait affective measures that strongly relate to perceived stress are below the study mean: STAI trait (Z = -0.33) and CES-D (Z = -0.14) both lean lower, which is a robust indicator of lower chronic anxiety and lower recent depressive symptom burden relative to peers. In this sample both measures correlate positively with PSS, so lower scores imply lower perceived stress.
- Self-esteem and subjective well-being are favorable: Rosenberg Self-Esteem is high (37) and current happiness is above average (score 4.0, Z ≈ +0.55); these features are negatively associated with PSS in the cohort and typically buffer perceived stress.
- Objective cardiovascular and circadian markers are consistent with lower stress and good physiological regulation: resting heart rate is low (51 bpm, Z = -0.85), mesor is low (Z = -1.27), and 24-hour autocorrelation (a measure of day-to-day rhythm consistency) is relatively high (Z = +0.48). These patterns often index physical fitness and stable daily structure, both of which tend to associate with lower PSS in the sample.
- Health-promoting behaviors and social resources appear present: minimal substance use, regular participation in sports (1–2x/week, Z = +0.91), moderate socializing (1–2 hours/day), and good academic performance (GPA ≈ 3.7–3.75). These behavioral and social factors are generally protective against elevated perceived stress.

Integrative interpretation
Taken together, the preponderance of evidence weighs toward an overall perceived stress level that is below the study sample mean. Trait-level anxiety and depressive symptoms are lower-than-average, self-reported happiness and self-esteem are higher-than-average, resting physiology suggests good cardiovascular fitness and consistent circadian timing, and lifestyle indicators (limited substance use, regular sports, social time) are protective. The primary countervailing signals are disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5), some within-day variability, and a relatively late nightly sleep onset; these factors could elevate day-to-day perceived stress or fatigue even in the context of otherwise favorable trait and physiological markers. On balance, however, the aggregate pattern is more consistent with lower-than-average perceived stress rather than with elevated stress.

Comparison to population PSS mean and uncertainty
Relative to the study population mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), the participant’s profile is most consistent with being below the population mean. This conclusion is probabilistic: many of the strongest correlates of PSS in the dataset (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, resting heart rate, circadian regularity, self-esteem) are in directions that predict lower PSS here, while subjective sleep disturbance and modest behavioral fragmentation introduce some uncertainty. Limitations to note include the absence of a direct PSS score in the provided data, reliance on cross-sectional correlations (not causal indicators), and that some wearable-derived metrics are aggregated across days and therefore cannot resolve situational bursts of stress."
29792,"The dataset contains several behavioral and self-report features that converge on signals typically associated with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 43, Z = 0.17) is elevated relative to the study sample and is one of the stronger self-report correlates of PSS in this dataset (correlation ≈ 0.31), indicating a disposition toward anxiety that commonly accompanies higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 7, classified as “Disturbed Sleep,” Z = 0.13) and wearable-recorded sleep is shortened (median nightly sleep = 6 h 11 min, Z = -1.25) with substantial night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 107 minutes). The participant’s median sleep-start time is very delayed (approximately 04:32 AM), which together with short nocturnal sleep and greater sleep variability are behavioral patterns often linked to elevated stress and poorer stress coping. Alcohol use (beer three times per week, Z = 1.72) and relatively high evening physiological activation (large positive deviations from mesor in the 6–9 PM and late-night hours, e.g., 7–8 PM deviation = +23.6 bpm, Z = 2.12; midnight = +9.1 bpm, Z = 1.56) also suggest evening arousal and behavioral patterns that can be associated with higher perceived stress. Several circadian rhythm indicators point to reduced 24-hour regularity (autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.19, Z = -1.12) and only modest interdaily stability (0.46, Z = 0.42), which—together with the delayed sleep timing—can contribute to or reflect higher perceived stress.

At the same time, multiple features in the record are protective or associated with lower perceived stress. Depressive symptoms are not elevated (CES-D = 13, Z ≈ -0.03; classification “Not depressed”), and self-reported self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40, Z = 0.26), both of which reduce the likelihood of very high PSS scores. The participant reports above-average happiness (current happiness = 4.0, Z = 0.55) and frequent social physical activity (exercising with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23), which are psychosocial resources that typically buffer perceived stress. Objective physiology also shows some features consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic physiological strain—resting heart rate is relatively low (52 bpm, Z = -0.73), and intraday heart rate fragmentation is not elevated (intradaily variability = 0.50, Z = -0.32). Substance use beyond alcohol is minimal (non-prescribed drugs: “Not at all,” Z = -0.11), and the participant reports regular socializing (1–2 hours daily), which are both features that argue against extreme perceived stress.

Integrating these multimodal data suggests a mixed profile: there are clear behavioral and physiological signals consistent with elevated perceived stress—particularly the combination of trait anxiety, disturbed and shortened sleep with very late sleep timing, evening physiological arousal, and relatively high alcohol consumption—yet there are concurrent protective factors (high self-esteem and happiness, frequent social exercise, low resting heart rate, absence of marked depressive symptomatology). The objective circadian metrics point to reduced 24-hour coherence (low 24-h autocorrelation) despite modest interdaily stability, implying some circadian dysregulation that could maintain or exacerbate perceived stress even in the presence of psychosocial supports.

Considering the relative magnitudes of these indicators and their known associations with PSS, the overall balance favors a perceived stress level somewhat above the study population mean rather than markedly elevated. Therefore, compared with the study sample mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best described as above the population mean, but not extreme; this inference is probabilistic and tempered by protective features (high self-esteem, positive affect, social exercise) that likely limit the severity of stress. Limitations to this inference include the modest effect sizes of many wearable–PSS correlations and the absence of a direct PSS score in the provided data; hence this conclusion should be treated as an integrative, evidence-weighted estimate rather than a definitive measurement."
14737,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant shows a mixed profile with several indicators linked to elevated perceived stress alongside some behavioral and physiological markers that tend to be protective or associated with lower perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), irregular sleep timing and elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythms are the most salient signals that align with higher perceived stress. In contrast, a relatively low resting heart rate, a moderately robust circadian amplitude, minimal substance use, and a self-rated happiness score above the sample mean point in the opposite direction. Taking the balance of evidence together, the pattern is most consistent with an inferred perceived stress level modestly above the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62), rather than an extreme deviation.

Evidence favoring relatively higher perceived stress: The participant’s STAI–Trait score is 45 (z ≈ +0.37), and trait anxiety is one of the stronger self-report correlates of PSS in this dataset (STAI–Trait correlation with PSS ≈ 0.31), supporting greater stress proneness. Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 6), which commonly covaries with higher stress. Wearable sleep metrics show short median nightly sleep (6 h 3 min; z ≈ −1.41) and large night-to-night variability in both sleep duration (SD = 133 min; z ≈ +0.74) and sleep start time (median start 01:47, start-time SD ≈ 135 min; z ≈ +1.14). High variability in sleep timing and duration (and the positive correlations of those variability metrics with PSS: sleep start SD corr ≈ 0.17; sleep duration SD corr ≈ 0.14) are consistent with stress-related dysregulation of sleep. Heart-rate rhythm fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.64, z ≈ +0.67) is another wearable feature that correlates positively with PSS in this sample (corr ≈ +0.16), indicating more frequent transitions in activity/arousal across the day and night that can accompany stress. Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg score = 34; z ≈ −0.59) also tends to be associated with higher perceived stress (self-esteem correlation with PSS ≈ −0.15). Collectively these features—elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, irregular sleep timing, and rhythm fragmentation—are the strongest contributors pointing toward increased perceived stress.

Evidence favoring relatively lower perceived stress: Several indicators point away from high stress. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm; z ≈ −0.47), which often reflects good baseline cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic physiological arousal and is associated in this dataset with slightly lower PSS risk (resting HR correlation with PSS ≈ +0.14, but the participant’s value is below the mean). Circadian amplitude of heart-rate (amplitude = 12.42; z ≈ +0.53) and a clear daytime acrophase (~4:54 PM) suggest a reasonably strong day–night rhythm in cardiovascular activity; higher amplitude here is negatively correlated with PSS in the sample (corr ≈ −0.17). The participant reports little to no substance use (alcohol or recreational drugs; Z-scores notably negative), limited social substance-related activities, and an above-average momentary happiness rating (current happiness = 4; z ≈ +0.55). These behavioral and affective factors—low substance use, preserved positive affect, and measurable circadian robustness—constitute protective influences that mitigate the signal from the stress-related indicators.

Integrated conclusion and comparison to sample mean: When weighting the relative magnitude and direction of the available measures, the preponderance of moderate signals (trait anxiety above average, disturbed subjective sleep, high sleep-timing variability, and elevated intradaily variability in heart rate) outweighs the mitigating signs (low resting HR, preserved amplitude, low substance use, positive momentary happiness). The combined profile therefore suggests perceived stress modestly above the study population mean PSS of 21.62, rather than near or well below the mean. In descriptive terms: “above the population mean,” but not at the extreme end of the sample distribution. This interpretation is consistent with moderate positive correlations between PSS and anxiety and sleep irregularity in the dataset and with the participant’s moderate elevations on those specific measures.

Limitations and caveats: Inferred stress here synthesizes cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable features and should not be taken as a clinical diagnosis. Several associations in the dataset are modest in magnitude; some relevant correlations are small or null, and wearable heart-rate aggregates are temporally summarized (hourly deviations and cosinor metrics) rather than day-specific. If further precision is needed, targeted data to obtain a direct PSS score for the participant, day-level co-occurrence of stressful events with physiological responses, or follow-up assessments of sleep hygiene and anxiety would strengthen inference."
28653,"Summary of evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Across self-report measures the participant shows low symptom burden on standard affective scales (CES-D = 6, STAI-Trait = 29), above-average self-esteem (RSES z = +1.52), relatively high momentary happiness and health satisfaction, and a favorable PSQI (score = 4) indicating subjectively good sleep. Behavioral habits that typically buffer stress are also present: minimal substance use, regular exercise (particularly exercising with others three or more times per week), and very little time spent in sedentary recreational activities. Wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics further support a low-stress profile: resting heart rate is relatively low (53 bpm, z = −0.61), interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are above the sample mean (z ≈ +1.4) and intradaily variability is well below the mean (z = −2.08), indicating a stable, well-structured daily rhythm. High circadian amplitude (z = +2.26) combined with a typical daytime acrophase (~3:42 PM) and a median nightly sleep duration above the sample mean (≈8 h, z = +1.1) provide converging evidence of regular, restorative sleep-wake physiology—features that in this dataset are generally associated with lower PSS scores (see negative correlations for interdaily stability and amplitude).

Evidence that could point toward relatively higher perceived stress (or that warrants caution): Although most indicators are favorable, a few features could reflect episodic arousal or lifestyle factors that are not uniformly protective. The participant’s median sleep start is after midnight with a moderate night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 107 minutes), which can be associated with daytime difficulties for some people even when total sleep is adequate. The wearable hourly heart-rate profile shows a pronounced afternoon peak (notably 3–4 PM with a large positive deviation, z ≈ +3.8), which may reflect periods of heightened physiological activation—this pattern is not strongly or consistently correlated with PSS in the sample, but it could indicate concentrated periods of load or activity (e.g., classes, exercise, deadlines) that are situationally stressful. The participant also reports relatively little time socializing during a typical day (socializing z ≈ −1.41), which could reduce access to social buffering in more stressful periods; the association between socializing and PSS in this sample is small, however.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: Taking the multimodal evidence together, the balance of indicators points toward a perceived stress level below the study sample mean. Psychological symptom scores (CES-D, STAI), subjective sleep quality, health satisfaction, and objective markers of circadian regularity and cardiovascular fitness consistently align with lower PSS in the sample. There are some situational signals (late but sufficient sleep timing, concentrated afternoon physiological activation, relatively low daily socializing) that could increase vulnerability in specific contexts, but these do not outweigh the overall pattern. Therefore, relative to the study population mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), this participant’s data are most consistent with perceived stress that is below the population mean. 

Uncertainties and caveats: This inference synthesizes indirect markers and population-level correlations rather than a direct PSS measurement for the participant; many of the correlations with PSS in this dataset are modest in magnitude, so single metrics should not be overinterpreted. Episodic or situational stressors that were not captured by available records (academic deadlines, interpersonal events) could temporarily raise perceived stress without substantially shifting the baseline pattern observed here."
95559,"Summary overview: The participant’s dataset shows a mixed profile: self-report trait measures (depression, trait anxiety, and self‑esteem) are generally more favorable than the sample average, while wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures show substantial departures from the sample norm in directions typically linked with physiological dysregulation. Together these sources create competing signals about perceived stress: subjective symptom inventories point toward relatively low distress, whereas several objective behavioral and circadian features suggest greater disruption that has been associated with higher perceived stress in the study sample.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress. Several wearable-derived circadian and sleep metrics deviate substantially from the study population mean in directions that have modest correlations with higher PSS. Interdaily stability (IS; z = -1.98) and 24‑hour autocorrelation (z = -1.29) are markedly low, indicating weak day‑to‑day regularity in heart‑rate rhythms—metrics whose negative correlations with PSS (IS r = -0.12; autocorrelation r = -0.17) imply that the participant’s low regularity is associated with relatively higher perceived stress in the sample. Circadian amplitude is also reduced (z = -1.16; amplitude–PSS r = -0.17), which, given the negative correlation, suggests that this blunted rhythm aligns with higher PSS in the cohort. Sleep timing and quality likewise point toward potential stress-related effects: median sleep onset is late (≈ 02:10 AM) and the PSQI score is elevated (7; classified as “disturbed sleep”), both patterns that commonly accompany increased perceived stress. The participant also shows elevated mean daily nap frequency (z = 2.07), which correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.14) in the sample and can reflect compensatory sleep behavior or fragmented nocturnal sleep. Finally, alcohol use (beer three times a week or more; z = 1.72) and relatively low frequency of structured exercise (1–2 times/week) are behavioral features that can accompany higher stress or poorer coping in some individuals, although their direct correlations with PSS in this dataset are small.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress. Self-report trait measures indicate low affective symptom burden and protective psychosocial characteristics: CES‑D (score 8; z = -0.55) and trait STAI (score 29; z = -1.22) are both below the sample mean, and those scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), which supports interpretation that this participant reports relatively low depressive symptoms and chronic anxiety compared with peers. The Rosenberg self‑esteem score is above the sample mean (z = 0.96) and self‑esteem correlates negatively with PSS (r = -0.15), a pattern that would predict lower perceived stress. Physiological resting heart rate is lower than average (54.1 bpm; z = -0.48), and although resting heart rate correlates modestly with PSS in the sample (r = 0.14), the participant’s lower resting rate is more consistent with lower baseline physiological arousal. Intradaily variability (IV) of heart rate is also low (z = -1.80); because IV correlates positively with PSS (r = 0.16) in the cohort, this lower fragmentation metric is another wearable signal that would be expected to align with lower perceived stress. The participant reports few recreational or non‑prescribed drugs, a modest socializing schedule, and no signal of elevated depressive symptomatology on the CES‑D—each of which would typically weigh toward lower perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the population mean. The data present a divergence between subjective and objective indicators. Subjective inventories (low CES‑D and STAI, higher self‑esteem) give a reasonably coherent signal of lower personal distress, whereas multiple objective sleep and circadian metrics (late sleep timing, elevated PSQI, low interdaily stability and amplitude, frequent naps) point toward behavioral and physiological patterns that in this sample are associated with greater perceived stress. Given the strengths of both evidence streams but recognizing that perceived stress (PSS) is itself a subjective construct and correlates more strongly with self‑reported affect than with isolated physiological markers, the most defensible conclusion is that the participant’s perceived stress is likely near the study sample mean, with a modest tendency toward being elevated relative to peers. In plain terms: the participant’s inferred PSS is approximately near the population mean (21.62), with some objective features suggesting a mild elevation above that mean but subjective symptom inventories suggesting stress at or below average.

Key caveats. Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in this sample are generally modest; none of the wearable or self‑report indicators deterministically predicts PSS. The divergence between subjective reports and physiological/behavioral markers is common and can reflect coping strategies, timed but non‑persistent stressors, or individual differences in awareness and reporting. Finally, these inferences are probabilistic and descriptive; they are intended to summarize patterns in the data rather than to serve as diagnostic statements."
30152,"Summary and context:
Across self-report and wearable domains the participant presents a mixed profile: objective physiological indicators consistent with good cardiovascular fitness (low resting heart rate and low mean HR mesor), regular daytime bouts of elevated heart rate (pronounced afternoon peaks), and moderate levels of protective lifestyle behaviors (exercise three+ times per week, low substance use). Counterbalancing those features are subjective reports and circadian/ sleep signals that commonly co-occur with greater perceived stress: a PSQI in the “disturbed sleep” range (score = 7), very late median sleep onset (02:28), notable night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration, and measures of weak day-to-day circadian regularity (low interdaily stability and especially low 24-hour autocorrelation). Trait anxiety (STAI = 41) is near the study mean and self-reported happiness is below the sample mean—both relevant to stress appraisal.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher perceived stress:
- Sleep disruption and irregular timing: PSQI = 7 (classified “Disturbed Sleep”) combined with a very late median sleep start (02:28) and elevated sleep start SD (102 minutes, Z = 0.41). Sleep timing variability is positively correlated with PSS in this dataset (sleep start SD correlation ≈ 0.17), and irregular/late sleep schedules commonly relate to higher perceived stress and poorer recovery.  
- Weakened circadian regularity: interdaily stability = 0.35 (Z = -0.49) and especially autocorrelation at 24 hours = 0.15 (Z = -1.45) indicate that heart-rate rhythms are not strongly preserved day-to-day. Lower interdaily stability and autocorrelation are modestly associated with higher PSS in this sample (correlations ≈ -0.12 to -0.17). Such fragmentation of daily structure can reflect or contribute to greater stress perception.  
- Lower momentary well-being: self-reported current happiness is below the population mean (value = 3, Z = -0.53), and although depressive symptoms are subclinical, reduced positive affect and lower trust scores (Z = -0.46) are consistent with higher subjective stress or reduced psychosocial resources.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress:
- Low depressive symptom burden and modest anxiety: CES-D = 11 (Z = -0.24; classified “Not depressed”) and STAI = 41 (Z ≈ -0.03) are near or below sample averages; these scores do not indicate high depressive symptomatology and only modest trait anxiety, which argues against markedly elevated perceived stress.  
- Physiological indicators of fitness and controlled arousal: resting heart rate = 49.4 bpm (Z = -1.04) and low mesor (62.7, Z = -1.54) suggest good cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline sympathetic tone. In many contexts fitness and lower resting HR are protective and linked to lower stress reactivity.  
- Adaptive behaviors and health satisfaction: the participant reports exercising alone three+ times per week (Z = 1.07), low recreational drug use, and high self-rated health satisfaction (6/7, Z = 1.3). These lifestyle and health-appraisal metrics typically correlate with lower perceived stress and better coping resources.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample:
Taken together, the pattern suggests a participant whose objective physiology and health behaviors include several protective features (low resting HR, regular exercise, low depressive symptoms), but who also shows behavioral sleep-phase delay, notable variability in sleep timing and reduced day-to-day circadian regularity—features that tend to elevate perceived stress or make day-to-day life feel more dysregulated. Subjective affect is somewhat lower than average (happiness/trust) despite good health satisfaction, which further supports a mixed picture.

Relative to the study sample mean PSS (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), the totality of evidence places this participant’s inferred perceived stress near the population mean, with a modest tilt toward being slightly above average. In other words, the participant does not display a clear high-stress signature across all domains but shows specific, salient risk indicators (disturbed and irregular sleep timing and weakened circadian stability) that likely contribute to somewhat elevated perceived stress compared with the sample mean.

Notes on interpretation:
These are inferences based on cross-sectional and aggregated signals (including temporally aggregated hourly HR deviations and cosinor-derived circadian summaries). Correlations provided in the dataset are small-to-moderate and do not establish causation; ambulatory context (academic schedule, deadlines) and unmeasured psychosocial factors could further explain the mixed profile."
59592,"Summary of data sources and approach: The following interpretation integrates self-report trait measures, lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological and circadian metrics collected across the academic semester. Where relevant I reference standardized comparisons (Z-scores) and correlations with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) in the study sample to indicate direction and relative strength of associations; these correlations inform interpretation but do not override the overall multimodal picture.

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress
- Elevated trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 46, Z ≈ 0.46) is a robust psychological marker in this record and has the strongest positive correlation with PSS among the self-report variables provided (r ≈ 0.31). Elevated chronic anxiety proneness increases the likelihood of higher perceived stress independent of concurrent depressive symptoms.
- Wearable-derived signs of physiological and circadian dysregulation: resting heart rate is above the population mean (66.1 bpm, Z ≈ 0.95) and shows a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14). Intradaily variability of heart rate/activity is substantially elevated (value ≈ 0.78, Z ≈ 1.65), which reflects greater fragmentation of day–night activity patterns and is positively associated with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.16). These features—higher resting HR and greater intraday irregularity—are commonly observed with higher perceived stress or autonomic arousal.
- Circadian amplitude is relatively low (amplitude value 6.93, Z ≈ -1.25) which, in the present sample, is associated with higher PSS (negative correlation between amplitude and PSS). Low amplitude together with high intradaily variability and reduced interdaily stability (interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.9) indicates a less robust, more fragmented circadian organization—another physiological correlate of greater perceived stress vulnerability.
- Behavioral markers consistent with evening activity/late sleep timing: median sleep start time is late (about 01:49), which can align with elevated evening physiological activation and with stress-related schedule shifts. Lower self-reported current happiness (score 3.0, Z ≈ -0.53) also correlates modestly with higher PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.19).

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress
- Subjective sleep quality is not strongly disturbed by standard criteria: PSQI = 5 (Z ≈ -0.8) is in the “good sleep” range relative to the sample and suggests the participant does not report major sleep complaints despite the late bedtime. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 6 h 57 min (Z ≈ -0.29), i.e., near the sample average rather than severely curtailed.
- Depression symptom score (CES-D = 14, Z ≈ 0.07) is near the sample mean and classified here as “not depressed,” providing some protection against elevations in perceived stress that would accompany clinically significant depressive symptomatology.
- Relatively higher self-esteem (Rosenberg score = 35, Z ≈ -0.45 where higher self-esteem is protective) and strong academic performance (GPA values in the provided record) are psychosocial resilience factors that tend to relate to lower perceived stress or greater coping capacity.
- Low rates of recreational drug use and limited frequency of heavy substance use (alcohol moderate; beer rare) reduce the likelihood that substance-related behaviors are contributing substantially to elevated stress in this case. Social activity is present (socializing 1–2 hours), and health satisfaction is moderate—both can mitigate stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSS
- Taken together, the data present a mixed picture. The strongest stress-related signals are elevated trait anxiety (STAI), markers of physiological arousal (higher resting HR), and circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability, low amplitude, low interdaily stability). These multimodal indicators point toward increased perceived stress or greater stress reactivity. Conversely, subjective sleep quality, absence of elevated depressive symptoms, relatively high self-esteem, and other behavioral protections (limited substance use, good academic functioning) temper those signals.
- On balance, the pattern is most consistent with a participant whose perceived stress is likely somewhat above the study population mean, rather than markedly elevated. In other words: above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61), but not extreme relative to the sample distribution. This conclusion emphasizes that physiological/circadian indicators and trait anxiety push the inference upward, whereas subjective sleep quality and psychosocial strengths moderate the degree of elevation.

Uncertainty and practical notes
- The inference is probabilistic: correlations with PSS in the sample are modest, and some physiological markers (e.g., circadian amplitude) can reflect multiple behavioral or contextual influences (shifted schedules, late-evening social or academic activity) in addition to stress per se. The late but regular bedtime (relatively low sleep start variability) suggests a stable but evening-shifted routine rather than chaotic sleep timing.
- If the goal is to reduce perceived stress or physiological arousal, the multimodal data suggest focusing on interventions that regularize circadian structure and reduce intraday fragmentation (consistent sleep–wake timing earlier in the evening where feasible, regular daytime activity/exercise timing), alongside strategies addressing trait anxiety (e.g., cognitive-behavioral approaches, stress management, relaxation training). Monitoring resting HR and intradaily variability over time could gauge intervention effects.

If you would like, I can produce a short prioritized list of evidence-based behavioral targets derived from these findings (e.g., sleep timing adjustments, activity scheduling, anxiety-focused interventions) or estimate a more specific expected PSS score range given the combination of markers."
89652,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of subjective indicators consistent with relatively low perceived stress and objective behavioral/physiological markers that suggest circadian and sleep irregularity that can be associated with elevated stress. Subjective mental-health scales (CES-D = 5, z = -0.86; STAI–Trait = 35, z = -0.62) and positive wellbeing scores (Rosenberg self‑esteem z = 0.82; current happiness z = 1.64) all lie substantially below the study’s population means for distress and above the means for wellbeing. Self‑reported sleep quality on the PSQI (score = 4, z = -1.26) is in the “good” range. Behavioral lifestyle indicators (very low substance use, regular sports 1–2×/week, high trust z = 2.75, strong academic performance) likewise point away from a high perceived-stress profile.

Features consistent with higher perceived stress: several wearable-derived and sleep-timing metrics indicate instability in sleep and circadian organization, which are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. Median sleep start time is very late (02:54), sleep duration is modestly short (median 6 h 34 m, z = -0.76) and sleep duration standard deviation is elevated (SD = 172 min, z = 1.62), indicating large night‑to‑night variability. Intradaily variability of the heart‑rate rhythm is elevated (0.73, z = 1.30), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.22, z = -0.87), both of which signal fragmented or inconsistent daily structure. Mean daily naps are slightly above the sample mean (0.2, z = 1.49), consistent with compensatory daytime sleep. These rhythm and variability metrics have small positive correlations with PSS in the study (e.g., intradaily variability r ≈ 0.15; sleep variability r ≈ 0.13), so they provide modest evidence that the participant’s behavioral regularity could contribute to higher perceived stress or vulnerability to stress.

Features consistent with lower perceived stress: subjective and behavioral measures strongly favor a lower-stress interpretation. Low depressive and anxiety scores, elevated self-esteem and happiness, high interpersonal trust, minimal substance use, frequent sports participation, and a good PSQI score form a consistent cluster indicating relatively low psychological distress. Physiologically, the participant’s resting heart rate (60.3 bpm, z = 0.26) and heart-rate MESOR and amplitude are near the cohort mean, and daytime peaks in aggregated heart rate (largest deviation at 3–4 pm, z = 1.61) likely reflect normal daytime activity rather than sustained physiological hyperarousal; correlations between most hourly heart-rate deviations and PSS are very small. The combination of robust subjective wellbeing with normative average cardiac metrics provides stronger evidence for lower current perceived stress than the wearable-derived irregularity metrics provide for higher stress.

Integrated conclusion relative to the study sample mean: weighing the evidence, the participant’s profile is most consistent with perceived stress at or below the study population mean. Subjective mental‑health measures and self‑reported wellbeing are clearly favorable and argue for lower perceived stress; objective indicators of circadian/sleep irregularity indicate potential stress-related risk but have only modest associations with PSS in this sample. Therefore, relative to the study sample mean PSS (21.6, SD = 3.67), the participant’s inferred perceived stress is likely below the population mean, though not without behavioral patterns (late and variable sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability) that could increase perceived stress if they persist or worsen.

Limitations: wearable circadian metrics here are aggregated across the recording period and cannot resolve acute or context-specific events; correlations with PSS are small, so causal inferences are not warranted. The balanced inference above gives greater weight to consistent subjective wellbeing markers while noting objective sleep/circadian irregularity as a meaningful area for monitoring or intervention."
28724,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of protective psychosocial factors (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, regular and sufficient sleep, frequent exercise) alongside objective circadian/physiological signatures that are sometimes associated with higher stress (elevated fragmentation of hourly heart-rate activity, reduced 24‑hour rhythm stability, modestly elevated resting heart rate). Considering the balance of evidence, the participant’s pattern of indicators is most consistent with a perceived stress level that is near the study population mean or modestly below it, rather than clearly above the sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several wearable-derived circadian metrics point toward degraded or fragmented daily physiological rhythms, which in this sample tend to correlate with higher PSS. Intradaily variability is elevated (0.76; Z = +1.51), indicating greater fragmentation of activity/heart-rate across the day and night; this metric has a modest positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16). Interdaily stability (0.32; Z = −0.74) and 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.19; Z = −1.12) are lower than the sample mean, reflecting less consistent day‑to‑day heart‑rate structure; lower values on these rhythm-stability metrics are associated with higher stress in the cohort (autocorrelation r ≈ −0.17, interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12). Amplitude of the cosinor rhythm is reduced (9.02; Z = −0.57), which likewise is modestly associated with higher PSS in this dataset (r ≈ −0.17). The participant’s resting heart rate (59.8 bpm; Z = +0.20) is slightly above the study average and has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14). Finally, the PSQI score of 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”) is a subjective sleep complaint that in many studies links with greater perceived stress and has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample context. Taken together, the objective rhythm fragmentation plus the borderline poor PSQI create a plausible pathway to higher perceived stress for this participant.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Multiple self-report indicators and behavioral habits point in the opposite direction. Depressive symptoms are low (CES‑D = 6, Z = −0.76; classified “Not depressed”), and trait anxiety (STAI = 40; Z ≈ −0.13) is close to the sample mean, not markedly elevated. Self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39; Z = +0.11) and momentary happiness is notably elevated (current happiness = 5, Z = +1.64), both of which are negatively associated with stress in the cohort. Sleep quantity and timing from the wearable are generally favorable: median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 49 min (Z = +0.79), and sleep onset time is consistent (median start ~23:59 with low SD; sleep start SD Z = −1.22), suggesting regular and adequate sleep opportunity despite the PSQI score. Health behaviors that typically reduce stress are present: frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more; Z = +1.07) and limited use of substances (no beer use, no recreational/non‑prescription drugs; limited weekly wine consumption). Social activity is present at modest levels (1–2 hours of socializing), and overall sedentary/recreational patterns are unremarkable. These psychosocial and behavioral strengths are strong protective signals that would be expected to lower perceived stress relative to the general student sample.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to population mean: Balancing the data, the most salient stress‑related warning signals are the objective circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability/24‑hour autocorrelation) and the marginally elevated PSQI; these point toward some physiological dysregulation that can accompany higher perceived stress. However, the participant also shows multiple strong protective factors (low depressive symptoms, relatively normal trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness, regular adequate sleep duration and timing, frequent exercise, low substance use). Overall, the profile is most consistent with perceived stress that is near the sample mean or modestly below it rather than clearly above it. In plain terms: compared with the study population mean PSS = 21.62, this participant’s inferred perceived stress is likely “near the mean” or slightly lower than the population mean. This assessment weighs protective psychosocial reports and health behaviors more heavily than the intermediate-level circadian fragmentation signals, which warrant monitoring but do not, on their own, push the balance to a clear above‑mean stress classification.

Notes and caveats: Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the cohort are modest, so inferences from single metrics are uncertain; conclusions here rely on the combined pattern across self-report and wearable-derived features. If a formal PSS score for this participant is available, it should be used to confirm the inference. The circadian fragmentation may reflect lifestyle scheduling or intermittent arousal (e.g., midday peaks in heart rate) rather than persistently elevated perceived stress; tracking changes over time or situational context (exams, deadlines) would clarify whether the fragmentation co-occurs with episodic stress."
69831,"Summary and overall impression
Across self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiologic data the participant presents a mixed profile with some indicators that typically accompany elevated perceived stress and several others that suggest relatively low physiological arousal and preserved mood/affective functioning. Self-report screening measures of mood and trait anxiety (CES-D = 10, STAI–Trait = 38) are below the sample mean (z-scores ≈ -0.3) and do not indicate substantial depressive or trait-anxiety symptomatology. Wearable physiology shows a low resting heart rate (56 bpm, z ≈ -0.26), a clear circadian rhythm (amplitude ≈ 11.4, modestly above mean), and low intradaily variability (IV = 0.44, z ≈ -0.74), which together point toward relatively low momentary physiological arousal and consolidated activity/rest patterns. Balancing these elements, the integrative signal is that perceived stress is likely near the study population mean rather than markedly elevated; if forced to place it, the profile is closest to “near the mean” on the study PSS distribution.

Features that are consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Several behavioral and subjective indicators are consistent with greater perceived stress or stress vulnerability. The participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed) despite objectively long sleep durations, which may reflect sleep quality concerns or sleep perception problems commonly associated with stress. The median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:34 AM) which can be associated with circadian misalignment and daytime functioning problems. Self-reported current happiness (score 3.0, z ≈ -0.53) and health satisfaction (2.67, z ≈ -1.2) are lower than the sample average, and the recent academic record shows deterioration (most recent term GPA 1.90), a potential psychosocial stressor. The participant reports effectively no exercise (exercised alone/with others = “Not at all,” z’s ≈ -1.6 to -1.9), and high time spent in passive media and social activities (e.g., socializing >4 hours, z ≈ 2.53; listening to music >4 hours, z ≈ 2.06; internet use 3–4 hours, z ≈ 1.52). These behavioral patterns (late sleep onset, low physical activity, increased passive media use) are commonly associated with higher perceived stress or poorer coping in population studies.

Features that are consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Several objective physiological features and symptom measures argue against high perceived stress. Trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are below the sample mean (STAI = 38, CES-D = 10), and self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 36, z ≈ -0.31 interpreted as above-average self-esteem), which—given the observed correlations in the sample—are protective with respect to perceived stress. Wearable-derived resting physiology indicates low basal cardiovascular arousal (resting HR 56 bpm), a robust circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ +0.2) and relatively low intradaily variability (IV z ≈ -0.74), consistent with consolidated activity/rest and lower within-day physiological fragmentation. Median nightly sleep duration is long (8:00, z ≈ +1.01) and nap frequency is negligible, both of which can be protective for daytime functioning. Several heart-rate–based metrics (e.g., low mesor, low RHR) and the sample correlations (small positive correlations of RHR and IV with PSS) suggest the participant’s physiological signature aligns more often with lower perceived stress profiles in this cohort.

Circadian and heart-rate timing interpretation
The cosinor/acrophase result (acrophase ≈ 4:43 PM) and the aggregate hourly deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations ~4–5 AM) and elevated cardiovascular deviation in the evening (peaks ~7–8 PM). The participant’s circadian rhythm metrics show reasonable amplitude and modest interdaily stability (IS ≈ 0.38), indicating generally regular daily structure but not unusually rigid day-to-day synchronization. Low intradaily variability suggests fewer abrupt transitions between rest and activity states across the day, which frequently corresponds to better physiologic regulation and is inversely related to some stress measures. The combination of a late habitual sleep onset with stable timing (sleep start SD ≈ 35 min, z ≈ -1.05) describes a regular but delayed schedule rather than an erratic pattern.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study PSS distribution
Weighing the evidence, the most coherent interpretation is that this participant’s perceived stress is not markedly elevated relative to the study sample. Objective physiology and symptom screening favor lower perceived stress, while subjective sleep complaints, reduced health satisfaction, late sleep timing, low exercise, heavy passive media use, and academic difficulties provide countervailing signals of strain. Taken together, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level is best described as near the population mean PSS score (study mean = 21.63). The pattern could be characterized as “near the mean,” with a modest tilt toward resilience on physiological and mood metrics but with identifiable behavioral and subjective stressors that could increase perceived stress under additional load.

If further inference or monitoring is desired, triangulating a contemporaneous PSS score, daily stress diaries, and measures of sleep quality (in addition to duration) would clarify whether subjective sleep disturbance and functional concerns (academic decline, low health satisfaction) are driving elevated stress perception that is not yet fully reflected in physiology or trait symptom measures."
44927,"Summary. Across self-report and wearable-derived measures this participant presents a mixed pattern of indicators relevant to perceived stress. Trait anxiety is elevated relative to some clinical cutoffs but sits near the study mean (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13, classification “anxious”), while depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76). Objective physiology shows generally healthy cardiovascular markers (resting HR = 54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42) and a pronounced nocturnal drop in heart rate, but circadian rhythm features (reduced amplitude, modestly lower interdaily stability) are attenuated relative to the sample. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ~00:59) and total nightly sleep is somewhat short (median duration 6 h 34 min, Z = -0.77) though subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, classified “Good Sleep”, Z = -0.8) is not elevated. Taken together, these measures point to both stress-vulnerable and stress-protective features; the balance suggests perceived stress near the study population mean with a tilt toward slightly higher stress.

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress. Several psychosocial self-report items that are modestly associated with higher PSS are present. Trait anxiety is consistent with greater stress reactivity (STAI = 40; STAI–PSS correlation ~0.31). Lower self-esteem (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87; RSES correlation with PSS = -0.15) and lower current happiness (rating = 3.0, Z = -0.53; correlation ~ -0.19) are additional psychosocial indicators that typically accompany higher perceived stress. On the physiological side, cosinor-derived amplitude is lower than the sample mean (Amplitude = 9.58, Z = -0.39; amplitude correlation with PSS ≈ -0.17), and interdaily stability is slightly reduced (0.39, Z = -0.16; correlation ≈ -0.12). These circadian features—reduced amplitude and modestly lower day-to-day regularity—have been linked in this sample to higher PSS and may reflect blunted daily physiological regulation associated with perceived stress. Sleep timing is relatively late (median start ~00:59) and nightly sleep duration is below average (median 6 h 34 m), which can exacerbate stress vulnerability even when subjective sleep quality appears acceptable.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress. Several behavioral and physiological markers suggest resilience or lower stress. Depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76), which is associated with lower PSS in this sample. Objective cardiovascular indicators are favorable: resting heart rate is low (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42), and there are substantial nightly heart-rate decreases (large negative deviations overnight), both of which are typically associated with good autonomic recovery and lower perceived stress. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (0.38, Z = 0.48; correlation with PSS ≈ -0.17), which indicates a stable 24-hour pattern and is associated in this dataset with lower perceived stress. Health behaviors also include protective elements: minimal substance use, a relatively high self-reported frequency of sports (three times per week or more, Z = 1.58) and low reported use of alcohol or recreational drugs—these behaviors tend to be associated with lower PSS. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5) is at the boundary of “good” and does not indicate major sleep disturbance.

Holistic appraisal relative to the study population mean. Balancing the above, the participant’s profile contains both modest risk factors (trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, reduced circadian amplitude, late/short sleep) and protective factors (low depressive symptoms, low resting HR and strong nocturnal HR reduction, higher autocorrelation in 24-hour rhythm, high sports participation, low substance use). Given the mix and the magnitude of z-scores and correlations provided, the most supportable inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study population mean with a slight tendency toward being above the mean (i.e., near-to-slightly-above the population mean PSS of 21.61). This conclusion reflects: (a) psychosocial vulnerability on measures that correlate moderately with PSS (STAI, self-esteem, happiness) and (b) countervailing physiological and behavioral strengths that are associated with lower PSS.

Caveats. Correlations provided are small-to-moderate and many z-scores cluster near the sample mean, so inferences about precise PSS level have uncertainty. Wearable-derived circadian and HR metrics are aggregated and do not index situational or acute stress reactivity. Clinical interpretation should avoid diagnostic conclusions; longitudinal monitoring or a contemporaneous PSS score would be required for more definitive classification."
71894,"Summary of self-report indicators related to perceived stress
The self-report profile shows multiple strong signals that typically accompany higher perceived stress. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 34, Z = 2.15) and trait anxiety (STAI-T = 64, Z = 2.24) are both markedly elevated relative to the study sample, and both scales have positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31). Self-esteem is low (Rosenberg = 19, Z = −2.7), and momentary measures of well-being are reduced (reported happiness Z = −1.61; health satisfaction Z = −1.95). Subjective sleep disturbance is present (PSQI = 6, classified as disturbed sleep), which is itself commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Taken together, the large positive deviations on depression and anxiety scales, plus low self-esteem and reduced subjective well-being, point toward a substantially elevated level of perceived stress.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian evidence
Physiological evidence from the wearable also provides several indicators consistent with increased stress-related arousal and circadian disruption. Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly elevated relative to the sample (RHR = 63.6 bpm, mesor ≈ 80.9; Z-scores ≈ +0.6 to +0.95), and intradaily variability is higher than average (IV = 0.66, Z ≈ +0.81), which in this dataset is associated with higher PSS (IV correlation ≈ 0.16). Circadian amplitude is lower than average (amplitude Z ≈ −0.75), a pattern often interpreted as blunted day–night physiological differences and previously associated here with higher stress (amplitude correlation ≈ −0.17). The hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced morning surges (very large positive deviations and Z-scores at 6–8 AM) and deeply negative night-time deviations; a sharply elevated morning rise in heart rate can reflect heightened morning activation or stress reactivity. These wearable metrics therefore align with a pattern of increased physiological arousal and greater within-day fragmentation that is commonly observed with higher perceived stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors that may mitigate perceived stress
There are several behavioral features that would tend to counterbalance or mitigate stress risk. The participant reports exercising regularly (exercising alone three times per week or more; exercise Z ≈ +1.07), low use of alcohol and no recreational/non-prescribed drug use, and limited daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z ≈ −0.86). Objective sleep timing is relatively consistent (median sleep start ≈ 23:55 with modest standard deviation, Z ≈ −0.56) and night-to-night sleep variability is low (sleep duration SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z ≈ −1.06). Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm is moderate (IS ≈ 0.47, Z ≈ +0.5) and autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (Z ≈ +1.48), indicating a reasonably regular daily structure; in this dataset higher IS and autocorrelation are associated with lower PSS. The participant also reports substantial social time (socializing 3–4 hours, Z ≈ +1.74), which can be a stress-buffering behavior. These factors constitute meaningful behavioral resilience against stress.

Balanced synthesis and overall inference about perceived stress relative to the sample
Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most salient indicators converge on elevated perceived stress: markedly high depressive and trait-anxiety scores, low self-esteem, reduced subjective happiness and health satisfaction, disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), and physiological signs of greater within-day variability and morning arousal. Protective features (regular exercise, low substance use, relatively consistent sleep timing, social contact, and some circadian regularity) are present but appear smaller in magnitude relative to the psychological symptom burden. Given the size of the elevations on CES-D and STAI (both >2 SD above the sample mean) and the direction and magnitude of wearable indicators tied to stress, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level is most consistent with being above the population mean PSS for this study sample (population mean PSS = 21.61). 

Limitations and caveats
This inference is based on cross-modal correlates rather than on a directly reported PSS value; correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the sample are modest, so any inference carries uncertainty. The wearable data are aggregated in time (hourly means and summary circadian metrics) and cannot resolve situational or day-specific events that might influence stress. Therefore the conclusion—above the population mean—is best interpreted as probabilistic and supported by multiple converging signals rather than definitive measurement of the participant’s PSS."
30453,"Summary: The combined self-report and wearable data indicate a pattern of elevated psychological distress and physiological dysregulation alongside some behavioral resources. Self-report scales show relatively high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 31, Z = 1.84) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 51, Z ≈ 0.96). Subjective sleep quality is markedly poor (PSQI = 16, Z = 4.29), and the participant reports lower-than-average self-esteem (RSES = 27, Z = −1.57), lower happiness and lower health satisfaction. Wearable-derived physiology and circadian summaries are consistent with stress-related dysregulation: resting heart rate and mesor are above the study mean (RHR = 67.5 bpm, Z = 1.11; MESOR = 80.18, Z = 0.85), circadian amplitude is reduced (Z = −0.63), interdaily stability is low (Z = −0.9) and intradaily variability is elevated (Z = 0.6), and sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep start 01:21, sleep SD 145 min, SD Z = 1.0). Taken together, these signals point toward a state of elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher perceived stress: The strongest indicators of greater perceived stress are the elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D) and higher trait anxiety, both of which correlate positively with PSS in this dataset and have effect sizes (Z-scores) meaningfully above the population mean. Subjective sleep disturbance is extreme (PSQI Z = 4.29), a robust correlate of perceived stress and a likely driver of daytime distress. Physiological markers align with these reports: higher resting heart rate and elevated mesor suggest increased basal autonomic arousal, reduced circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability reflect blunted and irregular 24-hour physiological rhythms that are commonly associated with chronic stress and mood disturbance, and intradaily variability (fragmentation) is above average. The participant’s median sleep duration is shorter than the study mean (≈6 h 25 m, Z = −0.96) and sleep onset is late and inconsistent, which, together with high PSQI, would be expected to increase perceived stress. Lower self-esteem, reduced subjective happiness, and lower health satisfaction further amplify the picture of psychosocial strain.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower perceived stress (protective or mitigating factors): There are several behavioral features that may buffer perceived stress or reduce its magnitude. The participant reports frequent organized physical activity (exercising with others three times a week or more; sports three times a week or more; Z-scores 1.23 and 1.58), which is typically associated with reduced perceived stress and improved mood. Substance use is absent or minimal (no alcohol, no recreational/non-prescribed drugs), a pattern that reduces one common risk factor for elevated stress. The participant also reports substantial time spent listening to music and reading — activities that can be adaptive coping strategies for some individuals. Some wearable hourly heart rate deviations show expected diurnal increases in the afternoon and evening (peaks in mid/late day), indicating preserved daytime responsiveness rather than global suppression of activity.

Integration and overall inference: Weighing the evidence, the balance favors an inference of perceived stress that is above the study population mean. The combination of markedly disturbed subjective sleep (very large Z), elevated depressive symptom burden, and elevated trait anxiety represents a set of strong, convergent predictors of higher PSS; physiological indicators (elevated RHR/mesor, reduced amplitude, low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability) provide independent objective support for stress-related dysregulation. Protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use, engagement in leisure reading/music) are notable and reduce the likelihood that perceived stress is maximal, but they do not outweigh the multiple strong risk signals. Relative to the study sample PSS mean of 21.61 (SD = 3.68), the participant’s multimodal profile is most consistent with a PSS score above the population mean.

Uncertainty and caveats: Several wearable correlations with PSS are modest in magnitude, and single-time self-report measures reflect recent weeks rather than stable lifetime states; thus, estimates of perceived stress carry some uncertainty. The protective behaviors noted could moderate future trajectories, and further longitudinal monitoring would clarify whether circadian and sleep irregularities improve with behavioral interventions."
66047,"Summary and overall inference:
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant presents a profile consistent with elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Markers that most directly map to stress-relevant constructs (clinically elevated depressive symptoms, very high trait anxiety, poor subjective sleep quality, low self-esteem, and reduced health satisfaction) are large in magnitude and point toward greater stress burden. Taken together with physiologic indicators of heightened cardiovascular tone (above-average resting heart rate) and behavioral tendencies linked to stress (late and variable sleep timing, increased daytime napping, low exercise, high passive screen time), the overall pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level above the population mean PSS score (population mean PSS = 21.61).

Features that indicate relatively higher perceived stress
- Psychiatric symptomatology: The CES‑D score is 46 (Z = 3.4) and STAI–Trait is 73 (Z = 3.13). Both are extreme elevations in the sample and show positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). These high scores are among the strongest single indicators that the participant’s perceived stress is elevated.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance and timing: The PSQI = 10 (Z = 1.52) indicates clinically significant sleep problems, and the median sleep start time is very late (≈ 2:41 AM) with substantial night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 84 min). Late, irregular sleep timing and poor subjective sleep quality are both associated with greater stress and poorer daytime functioning.  
- Physiologic arousal and circadian fragmentation: Resting heart rate is elevated (68.4 bpm, Z = 1.22) and intradaily variability (IV = 0.58, Z = 0.24) is modestly elevated; both features have small positive correlations with PSS in this sample (RHR r ≈ 0.13; IV r ≈ 0.16). Lower heart-rate amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.31; amplitude correlates negatively with PSS, r ≈ -0.17) can also reflect blunted diurnal modulation and is concordant with stress-linked dysregulation.  
- Daytime compensatory behavior and lifestyle: Mean daily naps are higher than typical (0.28 naps/day, Z = 2.4) and the participant reports very low exercise and high passive media use (TV and internet >4 hours; TV Z = 3.17, Internet Z = 2.19). Low physical activity and greater sedentary/passive media patterns are commonly associated with higher perceived stress and poorer mood.  
- Self-concept and health appraisal: Low self-esteem (RSES = 21, Z = -2.42) and low health satisfaction (Z = -2.28) are additional psychosocial factors that correlate with higher perceived stress (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15), further supporting a high-stress interpretation.

Features that indicate relatively lower perceived stress or preserved functioning
- Adequate median sleep duration: Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 15 minutes (Z ≈ 0.08), which is within a typical range for restorative sleep quantity and may partially mitigate stress-related effects despite poor subjective sleep quality and late timing.  
- Some circadian regularity and overnight recovery: Interdaily stability (IS = 0.43, Z ≈ 0.17) is slightly above average and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows clear nocturnal heart-rate dipping during the early morning hours (large negative deviations from mesor between ~2–7 AM). These features suggest some preservation of a 24-hour structure and nocturnal cardiovascular recovery, which are protective against chronic stress consequences.  
- Low substance use and some social contact: The participant reports minimal alcohol and no recreational/non-prescribed drug use (Z-scores negative) and reports 1–2 hours/day socializing; low substance use is a protective health behavior and some social contact can buffer stress.

Circadian/physiologic nuance (integration of aggregated heart-rate features)
- The cosinor-derived mesor (80.2 bpm, Z = 0.85) is somewhat elevated relative to the sample and the acrophase (~6:35 PM) aligns with an evening peak in aggregated heart rate. Hourly deviations show elevated evening and late-night heart rate deviations (positive deviations around midnight and again in the evening) with large early-morning declines. The combination of higher mesor and elevated evening/night activity together with reduced amplitude suggests a pattern of overall higher tonic cardiovascular tone and reduced amplitude of day–night modulation—both compatible with sustained psychosocial load but not a complete loss of nocturnal recovery.

Balanced conclusion and comparison to the population mean
Weighing all evidence, the data converge on an interpretation that the participant’s perceived stress is above the study population mean. The strongest contributors to this inference are very high depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 46) and trait anxiety (STAI = 73), poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10), elevated resting heart rate, late and irregular sleep timing, low self-esteem, and behavior patterns (low exercise, high passive screen time) that correlate with higher PSS. Protective signals—adequate median sleep duration, some interdaily rhythmicity, nocturnal heart-rate decline, minimal substance use, and modest social contact—moderate but do not outweigh the evidence for elevated stress. On balance, the participant’s profile is best characterized as above the population mean for perceived stress (i.e., greater perceived stress than the typical participant in this sample).

Interpretive caveats
These inferences are probabilistic and correlational: correlations provided are modest and wearable features are aggregated across days. Symptom scales reflect different time windows (e.g., past week vs. trait), and physiological measures may be influenced by unmeasured factors (medication, fitness, acute illness). The strongest single indicators here are the self-report psychiatric symptom scores; physiological and behavioral metrics provide convergent but smaller-scale support."
79834,"Summary: The available self-report and wearable data present a mixed but overall coherent picture in which several objective physiological markers and symptom scales point toward relatively low perceived stress, while behavioral and subjective sleep/ lifestyle indicators provide some countervailing signals that could support elevated perceived stress. Objective circadian and cardiovascular features (low resting heart rate, strong 24-hour autocorrelation, relatively high amplitude and low intradaily variability) and low scores on depressive and trait-anxiety scales are the strongest single-mode evidence for lower perceived stress. By contrast, a borderline clinically elevated PSQI (score = 6), late median sleep onset (00:46), limited physical/social recreation and low self-reported trust are the clearest features that could be consistent with greater perceived stress. Taking all modalities into account, the balance of evidence indicates the participant’s perceived stress is likely below the study population mean (the study sample mean PSS = 21.62).

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Psychological symptom scales: The participant’s CES-D (8) and STAI–Trait (37) scores are below the study average (z-scores -0.55 and -0.43 respectively). These lower symptom scores, together with an above-average self-esteem score (RSES z ≈ -0.17 is near the mean) suggest fewer mood/anxiety symptoms that typically co-occur with higher PSS scores.
- Cardiovascular and circadian robustness: Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a fairly regular and well-entrained rhythm. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (value 0.40, z = 0.64; this metric correlates negatively with PSS in the sample), amplitude is elevated (12.5, z = 0.56; amplitude also correlates negatively with PSS), and intradaily variability is low (0.41, z = -0.95). These features (greater day–night contrast and day-to-day regularity) are generally associated with lower perceived stress in the cohort.
- Low resting cardiovascular arousal: Resting heart rate is comparatively low (52.9 bpm, z = -0.62). In this sample higher resting heart rate tended to be associated with higher PSS, so a low resting heart rate is consistent with lower perceived stress.
- Sleep quantity and stability: Wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 18 m, z = 1.39) and night-to-night variability is not elevated. Longer, more regular sleep quantity—when it co-occurs with stable circadian markers—often accompanies lower perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Subjective sleep quality: The self-report PSQI score is 6, which exceeds the common clinical cutoff (>5) and is classified as “Disturbed Sleep.” Subjective sleep difficulties are often linked with higher perceived stress and can reflect stress-related sleep fragmentation or poorer restorative sleep even when sleep duration is long.
- Late and potentially socially isolated lifestyle pattern: Median sleep start at ~00:46 and low rates of exercise (both alone and with others), minimal engagement in reading or other sedentary hobbies, and limited listening-to-music time suggest a lifestyle with fewer typical leisure or social buffering activities. Limited engagement in stress-mitigating behaviors (exercise, social/leisure) can contribute to or sustain higher perceived stress over time.
- Low interpersonal trust and some substance use: The trust score is low relative to peers (z ≈ -1.42). Reduced trust/social support can amplify perceived stress. Alcohol use (wine/liquor reported three times per week or more; z = 1.68) is elevated relative to the sample; while its correlation with PSS in this cohort is small, frequent alcohol use can be a coping behavior that co-occurs with stress for some individuals.
- Mismatch between subjective and objective sleep: The combination of objectively long/regular sleep with a self-reported disturbed sleep score suggests a subjective sleep disturbance that may reflect nocturnal awakenings, sleep quality concerns, or stress-related sleep perception. Subjective sleep complaints often track perceived stress even when wearable-derived duration appears adequate.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the population mean
Weighing objective physiology, symptom scales, and behavioral data, the preponderance of evidence supports an inference that this participant’s perceived stress is below the study sample mean (i.e., “below the population mean” of 21.62). The strongest signals for lower perceived stress are low depressive/anxiety symptom scores, a low resting heart rate, and robust circadian organization (high 24-hour autocorrelation and amplitude, low intradaily variability). These markers are relatively robust physiological and symptom indicators in this dataset and tend to have consistent associations with lower PSS in the cohort. Countervailing evidence—subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6), late bedtimes, limited exercise/leisure engagement, and low interpersonal trust—indicates some behavioral and perceptual vulnerabilities that could elevate perceived stress or reduce resilience in certain contexts. Because many of the correlations with PSS in the dataset are modest in magnitude and the wearable hourly heart-rate values are temporally aggregated, this inference should be treated as a probabilistic assessment rather than a definitive measurement of PSS for this individual.

Caveats and limits on interpretation
- PSS was not provided for this individual; the conclusion is an inference based on correlated features and should be treated as an estimate.
- Correlations reported in the cohort are modest; single metrics should not be over-interpreted.
- Wearable-derived metrics are aggregated and physiological—subjective experience (e.g., PSQI) can diverge from device measures and may be especially relevant for perceived stress.
Recommendation (optional): To resolve the subjective/objective sleep mismatch and clarify stress-related lifestyle factors, consider obtaining the participant’s actual PSS score, brief ecological momentary assessments of daily stressors, and further characterization of sleep continuity (wake after sleep onset) or daytime functioning."
33133,"Summary and overall inference:
Integrating self-report and wearable-derived data yields a profile consistent with elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Several self-report indicators that correlate positively with perceived stress (notably depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety) are substantially above the sample mean, and objective circadian/physiological features show patterns often associated with greater stress burden (increased fragmentation of daily physiology and a pronounced morning heart-rate surge). Taking the totality of evidence, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is above the population mean PSS score (population mean = 21.61). The pattern suggests a moderately elevated PSS relative to the sample rather than an extreme outlier.

Factors that point toward relatively higher perceived stress:
- High depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety: CES-D = 31 (z = 1.84; labeled “Depressed”) and STAI-Trait = 49 (z = 0.76; “anxious”) are both above the sample mean and have positive correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). These elevations are primary psychological contributors to higher inferred perceived stress.  
- Poor subjective sleep quality: PSQI = 11 (z = 1.98; “Disturbed Sleep”) indicates notable sleep complaints, and poor sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Sleep timing is fairly late (median sleep start ~00:40) and median sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 38 min, z = −0.68), which can exacerbate perceived strain.  
- Circadian and variability features consistent with stress: Intradaily variability is elevated (value = 0.63; z = 0.60), indicating greater fragmentation of heart-rate rhythms across the day, a pattern that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16). Autocorrelation at 24 hours and amplitude are slightly low, suggesting less robust daily structure—another feature that, in the literature and in the dataset correlations, can accompany higher stress.  
- Behavioral correlates and lifestyle signals: High self-reported internet use (3–4 hours, z = 1.52) and lower reported happiness (z = −0.53) are additional self-report signals that align with elevated stress in this sample.

Factors that point toward relatively lower perceived stress or resilience:
- Regular solitary exercise and favorable objective cardiovascular fitness: The participant reports exercising alone three or more times per week (z = 1.07) and has a relatively low resting heart rate (58.6 bpm; z = 0.05), which can be protective against perceived stress and its physiological sequelae. Exercise frequency shows weak correlations in the dataset but is nonetheless a resilience factor.  
- Some stability in sleep timing and low variability of sleep duration: Sleep duration standard deviation is 63 minutes (z = −0.85), indicating less night-to-night variability than many peers, which can mitigate stress-related dysregulation despite short average duration. Mean daily naps are minimal (0.09/day), and the quantity of disruptive substances or non-prescribed drug use is negligible.  
- Social/functional indicators: Moderate socializing (1–2 hours; near-sample average), relatively high health satisfaction (z = 0.8), and consistently good academic performance (GPA history with several terms ≥ 3.7) are behavioral markers that may buffer perceived stress.

Physiological and circadian detail and interpretation:
- Heart-rate rhythm specifics indicate a relatively preserved mesor (73.5 bpm) but slightly reduced amplitude (10.1, z = −0.22) and modest interdaily stability (0.40, z ≈ −0.08). The combination of elevated intradaily variability and reduced amplitude suggests the daily heart-rate pattern is somewhat fragmented and blunted—physiological signatures that commonly accompany psychological distress.  
- The aggregated hourly deviations show a pronounced overnight heart-rate reduction (large negative deviations between ~1–6 AM) and an unusually large positive deviation in the 8–9 AM hour (value = +16.03; z = 2.09). This pronounced morning heart-rate surge may reflect either scheduled morning activity (e.g., commuting, exercise) or heightened physiological arousal on typical mornings; given the late sleep timing (~00:40) and exercise frequency, morning arousal could reflect activity-related increases but might also indicate morning stress reactivity in some days. These hourly deviations have modest correlations with PSS in the dataset but are notable because the morning peak is a strong relative signal compared with peers.

Balanced conclusion and confidence:
Weighing psychological symptom elevations (notably depressive symptoms and trait anxiety), disturbed subjective sleep, and objective physiological fragmentation more heavily than the protective factors (regular exercise, lower resting heart rate, modest sleep regularity), the overall multimodal evidence points to perceived stress above the study population mean. The evidence supports a moderate elevation rather than an extreme deviation; several markers are near or modestly above average while a few are strongly elevated (CES-D, PSQI). Confidence in this inference is strengthened by multiple convergent signals (self-report mood and sleep complaints plus circadian fragmentation), but it is limited by the absence of a direct PSS score in the file and by the cross-sectional/aggregated nature of some wearable metrics. The profile should be interpreted as probabilistic evidence for above-mean perceived stress, not as a clinical determination."
47810,"Summary — overall inference:
Taken together, the self-report and wearable-derived data indicate a pattern of modestly elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Multiple objective and subjective signals that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress (notably disturbed subjective sleep, a fragmented circadian/activity profile, short nocturnal sleep and increased napping, and elevated evening physiological arousal) outweigh a number of protective traits (low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low resting heart rate and limited substance use). Relative to the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), the profile is best characterized as above the population mean (i.e., a mild-to-moderate elevation rather than an extreme outlier).

Features consistent with greater perceived stress
- Sleep quality and quantity: The participant reports poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9; Z ≈ +1.05), and wearable-recorded median nocturnal sleep is relatively short (6 h 40 min; Z ≈ −0.65). Short sleep and higher PSQI scores are robustly associated with higher perceived stress and poorer recovery, making this a salient risk marker.  
- Circadian fragmentation and irregularity: Non‑parametric circadian metrics show elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.83; Z ≈ +2.01) and relatively low 24‑hour autocorrelation (value = 0.21; Z ≈ −0.95). A high IV indicates frequent transitions between rest and activity within the day (fragmentation), which is commonly linked to stress, sleep disturbance, and poorer mood.  
- Compensatory daytime sleep behavior: Mean daily naps are elevated (0.27 naps/day; Z ≈ +2.34), consistent with daytime compensation for insufficient or nonrestorative nighttime sleep and often co-occurring with stress or fatigue.  
- Evening physiological arousal: Hourly heart‑rate deviations show relatively large positive departures from the mesor in late afternoon and evening hours (peaks around mid/late afternoon to evening, with z‑scores for those hours in the positive range). The cosinor acrophase is late afternoon (around 4:46 PM), and amplitude is modestly above average (Z ≈ +0.52), which together suggest higher daytime/evening cardiovascular activation rather than a strongly attenuated diurnal rhythm. Evening arousal and delayed timing can be associated with stress-related rumination or evening activity patterns that impede sleep onset.  
- Subjective affect and health satisfaction: Current happiness and health satisfaction are lower than average (happiness Z ≈ −0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ −0.7), and CES‑D shows a small positive elevation in depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 15; Z ≈ +0.18). These affective indicators cohere with higher perceived stress in population samples.

Features consistent with lower perceived stress (protective/mitigating)
- Trait anxiety and self‑esteem: Trait anxiety is below the study mean (STAI Trait = 37; Z ≈ −0.43) and self‑esteem is high (Rosenberg = 39; Z ≈ +0.11). Lower trait anxiety and higher self‑esteem are both associated with lower perceived stress and greater resilience to daily stressors.  
- Cardiovascular baseline and fitness indicators: Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.3 bpm; Z ≈ −0.22), which can reflect better cardiovascular fitness or greater parasympathetic tone — factors that often buffer subjective stress responses.  
- Low substance use and modest exercise: The participant reports minimal recreational drug use and low-to-moderate alcohol consumption (wine 1–2x/week), with some regular exercise (exercising alone/with others and sports ~1–2x/week). Low substance use and some physical activity are protective relative to behaviors that exacerbate stress.  
- Academic functioning and other behavioral markers: Academic performance (GPA) is high and stable, and many sedentary recreational habits (TV/video gaming, reading) are below cohort averages; these may reflect structured time use and competence in academic roles, which can mitigate perceived stress for some individuals.

Wearable circadian and physiological synthesis
- Circadian summary metrics and hourly heart‑rate deviations converge on a picture of relative diurnal structure with notable within‑day instability: interdaily stability is near average (0.40; Z ≈ −0.08), but intraday variability is markedly elevated, indicating that although day-to-day timing may be roughly similar, the within-day pattern is fragmented. The cosinor MESOR is near the cohort mean (75.2 bpm; Z ≈ +0.17) while the acrophase in the late afternoon and elevated evening heart‑rate deviations suggest a pattern of higher physiological activation later in the day. Overnight heart‑rate departures are strongly negative (large negative deviations from the mesor between ~2–6 AM), consistent with nocturnal cardiovascular lowering, but that lowering does not appear to translate into subjectively restorative sleep outcomes (given the PSQI and short sleep duration).

Integrated interpretation and degree of likely PSS elevation
Weighing the evidence, the most striking and clinically relevant signals are poor subjective sleep quality, short nocturnal sleep, frequent naps, and pronounced intraday fragmentation — each of which has established links to higher perceived stress. Protective features (lower trait anxiety, high self‑esteem, low resting heart rate, limited substance use, acceptable exercise frequency, and strong academic performance) moderate the overall risk but do not fully counterbalance the sleep‑ and circadian‑related stress signals. On balance, the profile is consistent with a participant whose perceived stress is above the sample mean but not extreme; a reasonable characterization is a mild-to-moderate elevation in perceived stress relative to the cohort (i.e., “above the population mean” rather than near or below it). Because objective correlations with PSS in this dataset are generally modest, this inference should be considered probabilistic rather than definitive.

Caveats and suggestions
- Many associations here are correlational and modest in magnitude; the available trait measures (e.g., STAI, CES‑D) provide important complementary information and reduce the likelihood of a high trait anxiety explanation for any elevated PSS.  
- If more precise classification is required, direct PSS score(s) from the participant should be used. If the goal is intervention, addressing nocturnal sleep quality and circadian fragmentation (e.g., sleep‑timing regularity, evening arousal reduction, behavioral sleep strategies) would be the highest‑priority targets given the pattern observed."
58196,"Summary and overall inference
Based on the combined self-report and wearable data, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s perceived stress level is likely below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). Multiple self-report indicators that correlate with lower perceived stress (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high happiness, high self‑esteem, good subjective sleep quality and health satisfaction, frequent exercise, and limited substance use) are relatively pronounced and of moderate effect size. Wearable-derived fitness-related physiology (low resting heart rate) further supports a lower-stress profile. However, objective circadian and within-day rhythm measures show some irregularity and fragmentation that are more typically associated with higher perceived stress; these form the main countervailing signal and suggest potential behavioral patterns that could raise stress under some conditions. Overall, the data are most consistent with perceived stress below the population mean, with circadian/behavioral irregularities that warrant attention.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Several robust self-report indicators point toward lower perceived stress. Depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 6, z ≈ −0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31, z ≈ −1.02) are both well below the sample mean; because these measures positively correlate with PSS in the dataset (CES‑D correlation ~0.28, STAI correlation ~0.32), their low values argue for lower PSS. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg score z ≈ +1.10) and self‑reported current happiness is elevated (score 5, z ≈ +1.64); both are negatively associated with PSS in the sample and therefore are protective. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 4, z ≈ −1.26, categorized as “good sleep”) and above‑average health satisfaction (z ≈ +1.38) further support lower perceived stress. Behavioral lifestyle markers—regular exercise alone and with others (frequent, z ≈ +1.07 and +1.23 respectively), low recreational drug use, modest alcohol frequency, and strong academic performance (GPA consistently high)—also align with a lower-stress profile. Physiologically, a relatively low resting heart rate (53.4 bpm, z ≈ −0.56) suggests good cardiovascular fitness and is consistent with lower chronic stress load in many samples.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Objective circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate show patterns that commonly associate with higher PSS in this dataset. Intradaily variability (a measure of fragmentation of the 24‑hour rhythm) is elevated (value = 0.66, z ≈ +0.81) and has a modest positive correlation with PSS (≈ +0.16), indicating greater within‑day irregularity that can reflect fragmented activity or arousal. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation—measures of day‑to‑day regularity—are relatively low (interdaily stability = 0.34, z ≈ −0.57; autocorrelation at 24 hours = 0.22, z ≈ −0.87); lower values on these features are modestly associated with higher PSS in the sample (autocorrelation correlation ≈ −0.17, interdaily stability correlation ≈ −0.12). The cosinor amplitude is somewhat reduced (amplitude z ≈ −0.63) and mesor is lower than average (mesor z ≈ −1.01), suggesting a blunted or less pronounced circadian cardiac rhythm—another pattern that can be linked to stress or irregular schedules. Behaviorally, the wearable-derived median sleep duration (6 h 33 min, z ≈ −0.79) is shorter than the study mean and the participant’s median sleep start time is late (around 01:02 AM) with some variability (sleep start SD ≈ 72 min); later and shorter sleep can be associated with higher perceived stress. Mean daily naps are slightly elevated (0.15 naps/day, z ≈ +0.94) and show a small positive correlation with PSS (≈ +0.13), which could reflect daytime sleepiness related to shorter nocturnal sleep or irregular schedules.

Integration and interpretive conclusion
Putting these lines of evidence together, the strongest and most direct signals (self‑reported mood, anxiety, happiness, self‑esteem, subjective sleep quality, health satisfaction, exercise frequency, and low resting heart rate) converge on relatively low perceived stress. The wearable circadian measures provide a consistent counter-signal, indicating within‑day fragmentation and reduced day‑to‑day regularity (intradaily variability high; interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation low), and a somewhat blunted cardiac rhythm amplitude. These wearable signals are associated with higher PSS in the study but have only modest correlations and therefore do not fully outweigh the multiple self‑report indicators of low stress. The most parsimonious conclusion is that this participant’s perceived stress is likely below the study mean PSS (i.e., “below the population mean”), but with measurable circadian and sleep‑timing irregularities that could increase vulnerability to stress or reduce resilience if circumstances change (e.g., increased workload, disrupted sleep schedules).

Caveats
Correlations provided in the dataset are modest and do not determine causality; wearable rhythm features reflect aggregated patterns and should be interpreted as one component of the overall stress profile. If the research goal is to reduce potential stress vulnerability, targeting sleep timing regularity and reducing intraday fragmentation (consistent sleep/wake times, regular activity patterns) would be logical next steps given the observed wearable signals."
62246,"Summary of evidence suggesting lower perceived stress:
The participant’s self-report profile and wearable-derived circadian and sleep metrics predominantly align with lower perceived stress. Psychiatric symptom scores are low: CES-D = 4 (z = -0.97) and STAI–Trait = 33 (z = -0.82), both well below the study mean and weak-to-moderately positively correlated with PSS in the sample; this pattern points away from elevated chronic distress. Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES z = 0.96), and this measure is negatively correlated with PSS in the sample, which also favors lower perceived stress. Objective sleep and circadian indicators are consistent with restorative patterns: median nightly sleep ~7 h 39 m (z = 0.59), low night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD z = -0.82), a low intradaily variability score (IV z = -1.59) and modestly elevated interdaily stability (IS z = 0.25). These wearable circadian markers (low fragmentation, reasonable regularity) are associated in the sample with reduced PSS. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57 bpm, z = -0.14), mesor and amplitude are within a healthy range, and daytime heart-rate elevations are pronounced in typical active hours (largest deviation 2–3 pm, z = 1.37), consistent with preserved day–night separation of activity and rest—an overall physiological pattern usually linked to lower chronic stress burden.

Evidence suggesting higher perceived stress (or potential risk factors):
There are a few signals that could point toward modestly elevated stress risk or reduced subjective well-being. Current self-reported happiness is somewhat below average (z = -0.53), and lower happiness in the sample is modestly associated with higher PSS; this may reflect transient dissatisfaction or situational strain not captured by trait anxiety or depressive symptom scales. Alcohol use (beer/wine ~1–2 times/week; z ≈ 1) is above population mean for some substance metrics, though its correlation with PSS in this sample is negligible and therefore of limited inferential weight. The participant reports relatively low engagement in some passive or restorative leisure activities (e.g., little time listening to music or reading), which could reduce subjective coping resources; these behavioral leisure metrics show weak correlations with PSS in the study but are relevant from a behavioral-health perspective. Finally, some hourly heart-rate correlations with PSS are small but positive for very early-morning hours (e.g., 4–6 am bins), which can sometimes index nocturnal autonomic tone differences associated with stress; these effects are small in magnitude here and should be interpreted cautiously.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population:
Taking the full multimodal picture together, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s perceived stress is likely below the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.62). Low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, elevated self-esteem, good subjective sleep (PSQI = 3; z = -1.72), stable circadian organization (low IV, modestly high IS), regular and sufficient sleep duration, consistent exercise frequency, and a relatively low resting heart rate collectively point to a lower-than-average PSS profile. Countervailing signals (some reduced happiness, moderate alcohol use, limited engagement in some leisure activities) are present but small in magnitude and, in this dataset, have weak associations with PSS.

Caveats and interpretive limits:
These inferences rely on cross-sectional self-report measures and aggregated wearable summaries; the heart-rate hourly deviations are temporally aggregated and do not permit identification of acute stress episodes or context-specific reactivity. Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the sample are generally small-to-moderate, so any single feature should not be overinterpreted. Overall confidence in the conclusion (PSS below the population mean) is moderate given convergent protective signals across multiple domains, but longitudinal or momentary measures of perceived stress would be required to confirm stability of this inference."
55424,"Summary overview: The combined self-report and wearable data present a mixed but overall concerning profile for perceived stress. Self-report instruments show notably elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 35, z = 2.26) and trait anxiety (STAI = 57, z = 1.55) with very poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 14, z = 3.37) and low momentary happiness (z = -1.61). Objective wearable measures show generally intact circadian structure and an objectively adequate median sleep duration (7 h 24 min, z = 0.27) but increased daytime napping (mean naps 0.24/day, z = 1.9). Taken together, the psychological symptom burden and subjective sleep disturbance weigh heavily toward higher perceived stress, while several objective rhythm and activity metrics provide a more neutral or mildly protective context.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The participant’s high CES-D and STAI scores are both established correlates of elevated perceived stress and in this sample have positive correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). The PSQI score is markedly elevated (14, z = 3.37), indicating substantial subjective sleep problems; subjective sleep disturbance commonly co-occurs with greater perceived stress. Reported low happiness and reduced self-esteem (RSES z = -0.87) further align with higher stress/negative affect. Behaviorally, an elevated rate of daytime napping (z = 1.9) and modest associations between sleep variability and PSS (sleep SD corr ≈ 0.14) are additional markers that have been linked to higher stress in this sample. Several wearable-derived correlations (e.g., modest positive correlations of early-morning heart-rate deviations and intradaily variability with PSS) also point to physiological patterns related to stress, though effect sizes are small.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress or resilience: Objective sleep duration is within the typical range for this cohort (median ~7 h 24 min, z ~ 0.27) and night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is not unusually large (sleep start SD ≈ 58 min, z ≈ -0.54; duration SD z ≈ -0.72), both of which can be protective against stress-related dysfunction. Resting heart rate is slightly below the cohort mean (57.6 bpm, z ≈ -0.07), and circadian measures indicate a reasonably robust rhythm (amplitude z ≈ 0.34; interdaily stability near average), which are features generally associated with better physiological regulation. The participant reports frequent exercise with others (≥3×/week, z ≈ 1.23), a social and behavioral factor that can buffer stress; academic performance (GPAs shown) is high, suggesting preserved cognitive/academic functioning despite symptom burden.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population: Balancing these sources, the preponderance of evidence—particularly the large self-reported affective symptoms (depression, trait anxiety), very poor subjective sleep quality, and low happiness—indicates the participant’s perceived stress is likely elevated relative to peers. Objective wearable data do not strongly contradict this but are less decisive; they show generally intact circadian structure and adequate sleep duration while indicating increased napping and some small associations between sleep/heart-rate variability and PSS. Compared to the study sample mean PSS (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68; 50th percentile = 22, 75th percentile = 24), the pattern of high depressive and anxious symptoms and pronounced subjective sleep disturbance suggests the participant’s perceived stress is above the population mean and plausibly near or above the upper quartile of the sample. 

Limitations and caveats: This conclusion emphasizes symptom-report measures that are strongly linked to stress, while many wearable-derived correlations with PSS in this dataset are modest. Objective measures can reflect both trait vulnerability and transient states (and are temporally aggregated here), and self-report instruments can be influenced by response biases. The inference about relative PSS level therefore carries uncertainty and would be strengthened by a direct PSS score, repeated assessments, or clinical interview."
23576,"Summary of protective indicators (consistent with lower perceived stress): The self-report profile shows low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7; Z = -0.66) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 34; Z = -0.72), both of which are modestly and positively correlated with PSS in the study sample but are low for this participant. Self‑esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg score reported as 45; Z ≈ 0.96) and overall health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.72), factors that in the sample are associated with lower perceived stress. Lifestyle markers also point toward resilience: minimal substance use, frequent solitary exercise (≥3×/week; Z = 1.07), regular social contact (1–2 hours/day), and strong academic performance (GPA consistently near 4.0). Wearable-derived physiology and sleep metrics further support a lower-stress interpretation: median nightly sleep duration is healthy (7 h 46 min; Z = 0.72) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD 58 min; Z = -0.98) and no naps reported (Z = -0.86), suggesting restorative and regular nocturnal sleep. Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.6 bpm; Z = -0.07) and circadian regularity measures are consistent with a stable rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.47; Z = 0.50; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 1.06). Overall, these convergent signals (low symptom burden, healthy sleep duration and consistency, regular circadian structure, low substance use, frequent exercise) are all characteristic of lower perceived stress in this cohort.

Indicators that could be consistent with higher perceived stress: The participant’s PSQI score of 6 exceeds the common clinical cutoff (>5) and is classified as “disturbed sleep,” indicating subjective sleep difficulties despite objectively adequate duration. Sleep start time is relatively late (median ~00:38) and while sleep timing variability is low, later bedtimes can be associated with stress or evening arousal in some individuals. Intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythm is modestly elevated (0.58; Z = 0.24) — in this sample greater intraday fragmentation shows a small positive correlation with PSS — and several hourly heart-rate deviations show afternoon elevations consistent with daytime physiological activation. A few physiological features (small positive correlations of intradaily variability and some nocturnal/early-morning heart-rate dips with PSS) suggest there are minor signals of physiological arousal that, in other participants, tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Importantly, these risk signals are small in magnitude and partly inconsistent (objective sleep is good while subjective sleep quality is poorer), so they represent modest rather than decisive evidence of elevated stress.

Synthesis and comparison to the study population mean PSS: Balancing all sources, the preponderance of evidence points toward a perceived stress level below the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.62). Objective behavioral and physiological measures (adequate and regular sleep, low resting heart rate, stable circadian measures, frequent exercise, minimal substance use), together with low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, weigh more strongly than the isolated indicators of elevated stress (PSQI >5 and late bedtime). Correlations between many wearable features and PSS within the study are generally small; where correlations exist they are modest, and the participant’s values are typically on the favorable side of the cohort distribution. Therefore, relative to the study sample, the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level below the population mean.

Caveats and uncertainty: This interpretation integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable measures; the hourly heart-rate values are temporally aggregated and cannot identify acute episodes or day-to-day fluctuations. Self-report measures (including PSQI) capture subjective experience which can diverge from objective wearable metrics; that divergence is evident here and introduces interpretive ambiguity. Correlations provided are small and do not prove causation. Taken together, conclusions about relative PSS are probabilistic: the participant appears likely to report lower-than-average perceived stress in this sample, but subjective sleep complaints and modest physiologic fragmentation merit consideration in longitudinal or clinical follow-up."
93485,"Summary: The multimodal record shows a mix of behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived physiological signals that, taken together, more strongly indicate lower perceived stress than higher. Key protective features include low self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, high health satisfaction, objectively robust circadian organization in heart rate, low resting heart rate, and generally adequate sleep duration and stability. A smaller set of indicators (slightly elevated intraday variability in heart rate, some mid-day cardiovascular peaks, modest alcohol use, and mildly reduced momentary happiness) could reflect transient or situational stressors but are comparatively weaker signals in this dataset.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Self-report mental health and well-being: The participant’s CES-D score (6; Z = -0.76) and STAI–Trait score (35; Z = -0.62) are both below the study mean, indicating relatively low depressive symptom burden and lower chronic anxiety proneness compared with peers. Self‑esteem is above average (Z = 0.82) and health satisfaction is notably high (Z = 1.8), both of which are commonly associated with greater resilience and lower perceived stress.
- Sleep and sleep-related perceptions: Objective median sleep duration (~7 h 1 min; Z = -0.2) and a PSQI score at the sample’s favorable end (PSQI = 5; Z = -0.8) suggest generally sufficient and subjectively acceptable sleep across the semester. Night-to-night sleep timing variability is modest (sleep start SD ~81 minutes; Z ≈ -0.05) and naps are essentially absent (Z = -0.86), supporting a relatively stable sleep pattern.
- Circadian and cardiovascular robustness: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics point to a well-organized daily rhythm: high amplitude (Z = 1.9), elevated interdaily stability (Z = 1.0), and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.23). These features typically reflect consistent daily routines and physiological regularity, which are negatively associated with perceived stress in the cohort. Resting heart rate is low (47.3 bpm; Z = -1.29), which often corresponds with higher cardiovascular fitness and/or lower baseline sympathetic arousal.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress (weaker/secondary signals)
- Intraday variability and aggregated hourly arousal: Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (value 0.61; Z = 0.46) and shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample. This metric can indicate more fragmented activity/rest transitions across the day and has a modest association with higher perceived stress. Hourly deviations show substantial daytime heart-rate elevations (largest deviations around late morning to early afternoon; e.g., 1–2 pm Z = 2.22) and pronounced nocturnal heart-rate troughs—the daytime peaks could reflect periods of increased activity, load, or sympathetic activation during the day, although they may also reflect normal daily exertion patterns.
- Behavioral and affective hints: Alcohol use at the “1–2 times a week” level (Z ≈ 1.0) is slightly above the sample median; although its correlation with PSS in this cohort is small, regular alcohol use can sometimes be an index of coping-related behavior. Current self-reported happiness is modestly below average (Z = -0.53) and reading/social sedentary hobbies are low, which could reflect less leisure-based recuperation for stress buffering. However, these signals are comparatively weak in magnitude and have small correlations with PSS in the study population.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to sample mean
Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals (low depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, high health satisfaction and self-esteem, regular sleep, high circadian amplitude and stability, and low resting heart rate) point toward a level of perceived stress that is likely below the study sample mean. Secondary indicators that could reflect situational stress (slightly increased intraday variability, midday heart-rate peaks, modest weekly alcohol use, and lower momentary happiness) are present but smaller in magnitude and have weaker associations with PSS in the cohort. On balance, the profile is more indicative of below-mean perceived stress relative to the sample (population mean PSS = 21.62). 

Caveats
These inferences rely on cross-sectional and aggregated wearable summaries and modest correlation magnitudes; therefore they support probabilistic interpretation rather than definitive individual diagnostic conclusions. The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations do not provide day-by-day context (e.g., exam weeks) and correlations with PSS in the sample are generally small, so contextual or temporal stressors could still be present but are not strongly represented in these summary metrics."
62617,"Summary of self-report and behavioral indicators:
The participant’s self-report profile shows multiple signals consistent with relatively low perceived stress. Depression (CES-D = 1, Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) are well below the sample mean, and current happiness and self‑esteem scores are elevated (Happy Z = 1.64; Self‑Esteem Z = 1.24). Subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8). Health satisfaction is modestly above the sample mean (Z = 0.38). Lifestyle behaviors that typically support lower stress—regular exercise (exercising alone ≥3×/week; Z = 1.07), low recreational drug use, and minimal napping—are present. Alcohol use is moderate (wine/liquor 1–2×/week, Z = 0.94) but other substance use is low. Taken together, the self-report and lifestyle data form a consistent pattern of psychological well‑being and health-promoting behavior that would be expected to correspond with lower perceived stress.

Wearable-derived sleep and heart rate (HR) circadian indicators:
Wearable sleep metrics reinforce the self-report evidence for good sleep: median nightly sleep is long (8 h 25 m, Z = 1.53) with modest night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD = 78 minutes, Z = -0.51) and almost no reported napping (Z = -0.86). Resting heart rate is within a near‑typical range (60.6 bpm, Z = 0.29). Circadian summaries indicate a relatively low amplitude of the cardiac rhythm (amplitude Z = -1.01) and low interdaily stability (Z = -1.73), while intradaily variability is also low (Z = -1.45). The hourly aggregated HR deviations show large nocturnal dips and clear daytime/evening elevations relative to the mesor, with pronounced evening peaks (e.g., 7–10 pm positive deviations). Overall the wearables depict generally adequate sleep, clear daily modulation of HR, but somewhat reduced day‑to‑day regularity in the cardiac rhythm.

Factors that point toward relatively lower perceived stress:
- Very low self‑reported depressive and trait anxiety symptoms (large negative Zs) and high self‑esteem and happiness are strong psychosocial indicators that typically correspond to lower perceived stress.  
- Long and relatively consistent sleep duration with good subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and minimal daytime napping are behavioral assets linked to lower PSS.  
- Regular physical activity (≥3×/week) and modest substance use patterns further support lower stress.  
- Several wearable circadian features (low intradaily variability, clear daytime HR elevations, and an overall resting HR in a normative range) do not suggest chronic physiological hyperarousal; these findings align more with lower perceived stress than with persistent high stress.

Factors that point toward relatively higher perceived stress or vulnerability:
- Interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is low (Z = -1.73), indicating the participant’s day‑to‑day schedule or activity timing is less consistent than peers. Lower circadian regularity has been associated with higher stress and poorer mood in population studies and thus represents a possible vulnerability.  
- The cardiac rhythm amplitude is reduced (Z = -1.01), which can reflect blunted circadian modulation; this feature has modest negative correlations with well‑being indices in some research and could reflect reduced physiological resilience.  
- Evening HR elevations (consistent positive deviations in the 7–10 pm hours) and a resting HR correlation with PSS that is slightly positive (r ≈ 0.14) suggest occasional periods of increased physiological arousal in the evening; while not large, these elevations could reflect activity, social/academic demands, or episodic stress.  
- Some small positive correlations between early‑morning HR deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.2 for several pre‑dawn hours) hint that overnight physiological patterns may relate modestly to perceived stress in this sample, though effect sizes are small.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study population:
Weighing all sources, the preponderance of evidence—particularly the low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, elevated self‑esteem and happiness, regular exercise, and objectively long, consistent sleep—indicates that this participant’s overall perceived stress is likely below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.63, SD = 3.67). Wearable signals introduce some nuance: reduced interdaily stability and lower circadian amplitude suggest a pattern of irregular daily timing and a mildly blunted cardiac rhythm that could represent a vulnerability to stress, and evening HR elevations point to episodic arousal. However, these physiological signals are moderate in magnitude and are offset by stronger, convergent psychosocial and sleep-related indicators of low stress.

Summary statement:
Overall, the multimodal profile is most consistent with perceived stress that is below the study sample mean, supported by strong self‑report evidence of low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high well‑being, and restorative sleep. The primary cautionary signals are reduced day‑to‑day circadian stability and modest evening physiological arousal; these suggest that attention to daily scheduling regularity and evening recovery routines may further support resilience to stress, even though current overall perceived stress appears lower than the population average."
42137,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Trait and symptom self-report includes features that typically align with greater perceived stress. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (trait) score is 42 (Z = 0.07; classified “anxious”) and the CES-D is modestly elevated at 15 (Z = 0.18); both have positive correlations with PSS in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31, CES-D r ≈ 0.28), so these scores provide direct evidence that the participant is more likely to report stress than someone with low anxiety/depressive symptom scores. Subjective sleep quality is also reduced (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59; classified “Disturbed Sleep”), which commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress and is frequently associated with elevated PSS in population samples.
- Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features include several markers that have been linked to greater stress in this dataset. Intradaily variability (0.63; Z = 0.60) is relatively high, indicating more fragmented or less consolidated day–night structure of heart-rate activity; this metric shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16). Amplitude of the circadian heart-rate rhythm is reduced (8.56, Z = -0.72) and mesor is comparatively low (62.6, Z = -1.55); lower amplitude here should be interpreted cautiously but is consistent with blunted daily physiological variation that can accompany higher stress or affective strain (amplitude correlation with PSS r ≈ -0.16). Finally, several hourly deviations show pronounced daytime HR elevations (e.g., 9–11am and especially 4–5pm with large positive Z-scores), suggesting periods of relatively heightened physiological activation during the day that could reflect work or academic-related demands contributing to perceived stress.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Several behavioral and physiological markers suggest resilience or lower acute physiological burden. Median nightly sleep duration is adequate (7 h 18 min; Z = 0.14) and sleep timing variability is not extreme (sleep start SD ≈ 78 min, Z ≈ -0.10); objective sleep quantity and reasonably consistent timing are commonly protective against high perceived stress. The participant reports frequent exercise alone (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), a behavior that typically buffers stress and supports mood regulation.
- Resting heart rate is low relative to the sample (50.3 bpm; Z = -0.93), which usually indicates good cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic physiological arousal. Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm is slightly above average (0.45; Z = 0.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation is modestly positive (Z = 0.22); these indices point to a generally coherent day-night structure across days, a pattern often associated with lower perceived stress (interdaily stability correlation with PSS r ≈ -0.12). Social and lifestyle markers are mixed but include relatively low substance use and acceptable health satisfaction.

Integration of circadian, sleep, and behavioral patterns:
- The participant’s wearable-derived profile reflects a well-defined nocturnal trough in heart rate (nighttime hourly deviations strongly negative) and distinct daytime peaks (notably late morning and a large peak late afternoon). The acrophase is around 3:19 PM, and amplitude is blunted relative to the sample. Together this suggests an intact but somewhat flattened circadian heart-rate rhythm: clear day–night separation remains (protective) but with less amplitude (possibly indicating lower daytime autonomic reactivity or a blunted physiological range). High intradaily variability indicates some within-day fragmentation despite reasonable day-to-day regularity. Subjectively the participant reports disturbed sleep quality even though objective sleep duration is adequate; this discrepancy (poor perceived sleep despite normal duration) often parallels elevated perceived stress and anxiety.
- Behavioral context adds nuance: regular exercise and low resting heart rate are protective, while reduced reported happiness (current happiness Z ≈ -0.53) and relatively low socializing (Z ≈ -0.62) are features that can relate to greater perceived stress or reduced mood support. Academic performance (GPAs in the mid-3.4s) suggests preserved academic functioning despite these stress-relevant signals.

Holistic conclusion about inferred perceived stress relative to the study sample:
- Considering the pattern as a whole—elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, increased intradaily variability and reduced circadian amplitude (all of which correlate with higher PSS), balanced against protective features such as adequate objective sleep duration, frequent exercise, reasonable day-to-day rhythm stability, and low resting heart rate—the participant’s profile is best characterized as near the study sample mean for perceived stress with a modest tilt toward higher-than-average perceived stress. In other words, the participant likely reports PSS scores around the sample central tendency (sample mean PSS = 21.61) but with enough anxiety- and sleep-related signal to suggest a slight elevation above the population mean rather than a clear deviation to either extreme.
- Key contributors pushing the inference upward are: trait anxiety (STAI), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), and circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability and reduced amplitude). Key contributors moderating or pushing the inference downward are: adequate objective sleep duration, frequent exercise and low resting heart rate, and modest interdaily rhythm stability. Taken together, the evidence supports an interpretation of modestly elevated perceived stress relative to peers, not an extreme outlier."
48013,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a mixed profile with several notable indicators of elevated psychological distress and disrupted behavioral/physiological rhythms, alongside a few protective behaviors. Trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35) and elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 19, Z = +0.59) are the most prominent self-report signals that typically align with higher perceived stress. Objective wearable signals of circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability Z = −1.48, low 24‑hour autocorrelation Z = −1.54, reduced amplitude Z = −1.08) and substantial night‑to‑night sleep timing variability (sleep start SD Z = +0.80; sleep duration SD Z = +1.13) provide convergent evidence of disrupted daily structure, which is also commonly associated with greater perceived stress. Taken together, these features point toward a perceived stress level that is likely above the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61).

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress
- Elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms: The participant’s STAI score (55; Z = +1.35) and CES‑D score (19; Z = +0.59, classified as elevated) are both positively associated with PSS in the sample (correlations ~0.28–0.31). These scales are strong psychosocial predictors of perceived stress and therefore weigh heavily toward a higher inferred PSS.  
- Circadian irregularity and blunted rhythm amplitude: Non‑parametric circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.23, Z = −1.48) and low 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = −1.54), and cosinor amplitude is reduced (Z = −1.08). In the study these rhythm regularity measures trend with PSS (negative correlations meaning less regularity relates to higher PSS), so the participant’s dysregulated heart‑rate rhythm pattern supports an interpretation of elevated stress.  
- Variable and delayed sleep timing: Median nightly sleep ~6 h 56 m (slightly below average, Z = −0.31) combined with large night‑to‑night variability in duration (SD Z = +1.13) and a late median sleep start (~01:04 AM with SD Z = +0.80) indicate unstable sleep timing. Greater sleep variability and later sleep timing show small positive associations with PSS in the sample and are consistent with stress‑related sleep disruption.  
- Low positive subjective well‑being indicators: Low current happiness (score 2.0, Z = −1.61) and low self‑esteem (RSES = 28, Z = −1.43) are additional psychosocial features that, in aggregate, align with higher perceived stress even when their sample correlations are modest.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress (protective or mitigating)
- Regular engagement in physical activity: The participant reports exercising alone and with others three or more times per week (exercise Z-scores > +1.0). Regular physical activity is generally protective against perceived stress and may moderate stress responses. In this dataset the direct correlations between exercise frequency and PSS are small, but the behavioral pattern is nonetheless a mitigating factor.  
- Limited substance misuse and modest recreational risk: No reported recreational or non‑prescribed drug use and relatively low frequency of beer consumption, with only moderate alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week), reduce the likelihood of substance‑related exacerbation of perceived stress relative to higher‑use individuals.  
- Reasonable median sleep duration and low nap frequency: Although sleep timing is variable, median nightly sleep is near 7 hours and daily naps are infrequent (mean naps 0.07), which provides some physiologic resilience relative to profiles with chronic sleep restriction. Resting heart rate is within a normal range (59.3 bpm, Z = +0.14), which also does not strongly indicate chronic physiological hyperarousal.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population
Balancing the evidence, the strongest signals point toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. High trait anxiety and elevated depressive symptoms are the most consequential psychosocial indicators, and objective wearable signals—especially reduced circadian stability and increased night‑to‑night sleep variability—converge with those self‑report indicators. Protective behaviors (regular exercise, limited substance misuse) and a near‑normal median sleep duration reduce the likelihood that the participant’s perceived stress is extreme, but they do not outweigh the combined markers of psychological distress and rhythm disruption. Accordingly, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level would most plausibly be classified as above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61). This inference is probabilistic and based on patterns in the available multimodal data rather than a direct PSS measurement for the individual."
14571,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a preponderance of indicators associated with relatively low perceived stress alongside a smaller set of behavioral features that could contribute to elevated stress. Self-report mental-health indicators (depression, trait anxiety, happiness, self-esteem) and objective circadian/sleep regularity measures are the strongest signals in the data and point toward lower perceived stress. Countervailing signals include high sedentary/screen-time behaviors, a relatively late median sleep start time, and modestly elevated heart-rate mesor/amplitude values which could reflect greater tonic cardiovascular activation. Taking all evidence together, the balance of data suggests the participant’s perceived stress is below the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.64, SD = 3.65), likely nearer the lower end of the distribution.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress
- Low symptom burden on self-report instruments: CES-D = 0 (Z = -1.38) and STAI-Trait = 20 (Z = -2.11) indicate minimal depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, both of which correlate positively with PSS in the sample; these low scores are strong protective signals against high perceived stress.  
- Positive self-appraisal and affect: high self-esteem (Rosenberg Z = 1.1) and elevated momentary happiness (Z = 1.64) are associated with lower PSS (sample correlations −0.15 and −0.18 respectively) and support resilient subjective functioning.  
- Good subjective and objective sleep regularity: PSQI = 3 (Z = -1.72, classified as “good sleep”), median sleep duration of ~7 h 14 min (near-sample mean, Z = 0.06), low night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD Z = -1.48) and modest nap frequency all indicate stable, adequate sleep — a pattern typically linked to lower perceived stress.  
- Strong circadian regularity: heart-rate derived interdaily stability (0.70, Z = 2.4) and high 24-h autocorrelation (Z = 2.24), together with low intradaily variability (Z = -2.29), indicate consistent daily rhythms and low fragmentation. These circadian features are generally associated with lower stress and better homeostatic regulation (sample correlations for these measures trend in the expected directions, e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ -0.10).

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress (or risk factors)
- High sedentary and screen-based recreational time: very large positive Z-scores for video games (Z = 4.74), TV/videos (Z = 3.17), internet use (Z = 2.19), and other sedentary hobbies suggest substantial time spent in low-activity, screen-based pursuits. Although correlations with PSS in the sample are modest, high sedentary engagement can be associated with poorer coping and could contribute to stress exposure or diminished stress-buffering activities (e.g., physical exercise was reported rarely).  
- Low social-trust score: Trust Z = -2.39 may indicate lower perceived social support or interpersonal confidence; low trust can relate to higher interpersonal strain and is a potential contributor to perceived stress even when internal symptoms are low.  
- Later sleep start time with modest evening cardiovascular activation: the median sleep start time around 01:04 AM is later than average; while total sleep duration is adequate, late timing can be associated with social or scheduling strain. In addition, the heart-rate mesor (83.8, Z = 1.35) and amplitude (Z = 1.72) are elevated relative to the sample and resting heart rate is somewhat above average (62.4 bpm, Z = 0.51). These cardiovascular features could reflect higher tonic arousal in parts of the day, which has a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample (e.g., resting HR r ≈ 0.14).  
- Low physical activity/exercise: self-reported exercise frequency is very low (Zs strongly negative), which removes a behavioral stress buffer and may increase vulnerability to stress-related outcomes over time.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population
Weighing the profile, the strongest and most consistent signals (near-zero depressive symptoms, minimal trait anxiety, high subjective well-being and self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, and highly regular circadian heart-rate rhythms) point toward lower perceived stress relative to peers. The elevated sedentary/screen-time behaviors, late sleep timing, and modestly higher heart-rate mesor/amplitude are notable risk or maintenance factors but are smaller in magnitude relative to the protective signals. Therefore, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is below the population mean PSS (21.64). Given the magnitude of protective indicators (very low CES-D and STAI scores and high circadian regularity), the participant’s PSS is likely nearer the lower quartile of the sample distribution rather than the median or upper range, though precise numeric prediction is not possible from these data alone.

Caveats and monitoring recommendations
These inferences combine self-report and wearable-derived metrics collected over a semester and assume stable relationships between the measured indicators and perceived stress. The data show some mixed signals (behavioral risk factors despite low symptom reports); therefore, periodic reassessment of self-reported stress and monitoring of behavioral patterns (exercise, social support, screen time, sleep timing) would clarify whether the observed protective profile is stable. If future assessments show increases in depressive or anxiety symptoms, elevated resting heart rate, or worsening sleep quality, the balance of evidence for perceived stress should be updated."
69057,"Summary of indicators associated with greater perceived stress:
Several converging features point toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Trait anxiety is high (STAI = 53; Z = +1.16) and this measure has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31), making it one of the stronger psychological predictors in this profile. Sleep is notably shortened and subjectively disturbed: median wearable sleep duration is brief (5 h 35 min; Z = −1.99) while the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is in the disturbed range (PSQI = 7). Both short objective sleep and poor subjective sleep quality are commonly linked with greater perceived stress. Circadian rhythm measures also indicate relative irregularity—interdaily stability is below the sample mean (0.32; Z = −0.74) and intradaily variability is elevated (0.60; Z = +0.39); the latter has a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), consistent with greater day-to-day rhythm fragmentation in higher-stress individuals. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈ 02:08), and heart-rate-derived acrophase occurs in the late afternoon/evening (≈5:40 PM) with a pronounced evening heart rate peak (largest aggregate deviation 5–6 PM, +22.8; Z = +1.79), which together suggest delayed/shifted timing and elevated evening physiological activation—patterns that can accompany greater perceived stress or difficulties offloading arousal at night. Academic performance shows a downward trend across semesters (GPA falling from 3.1 to 2.28), providing an additional contextual stressor. Lower self-rated health satisfaction, reduced happiness (both below the study mean), and modestly reduced self-esteem further align with features that tend to accompany higher perceived stress.

Summary of indicators associated with lower perceived stress:
Several features point in the opposite direction and likely mitigate perceived stress. The participant’s resting heart rate and overall heart-rate mesor are low (Resting HR = 43.6 bpm, Z = −1.73; Mesor = 57.9, Z = −2.19), which commonly reflects relatively good cardiovascular fitness or a low baseline physiological arousal level and can be protective with respect to day-to-day stress reactivity. Exercise behavior is frequent (reports exercising alone three or more times per week; Z ≈ +1.07), a behavioral factor often linked with lower perceived stress and better stress coping. Substance use is low (alcohol occasional; non-prescribed drugs not used), social activity is present (≈1–2 hours of socializing daily), and depressive symptoms are not elevated (CES-D = 12; Z = −0.14), the latter reducing the likelihood that high PSS estimates would be driven by concurrent depressive symptomatology. Some periods show clear nocturnal physiological down-regulation (sustained negative deviations from mesor overnight/early morning), suggesting that when sleep does occur there is physiologic rest. These protective features temper the implications of the sleep/circadian and anxiety findings.

Integration of wearable circadian and hourly heart-rate data:
The wearable-derived circadian summary describes a low overall mesor and amplitude alongside relatively low interdaily stability and modestly elevated intradaily variability. That combination describes a participant with a low average heart-rate level and blunted day–night amplitude but with less consistent day-to-day timing and relatively more fragmented within-day variability. The large evening aggregate heart-rate peak (notably 5–6 PM) and late sleep onset together imply a pattern of later behavioral timing and elevated evening activation. Because the hourly heart-rate values are temporally aggregated across days, they indicate a characteristic daily profile rather than transient episodes—so the elevated evening arousal and late timing likely reflect habitual scheduling/behavior rather than a one-off event. Correlations between these specific HR features and PSS in the sample are generally small, so these physiologic patterns should be interpreted as suggestive contributors rather than definitive drivers of perceived stress.

Holistic conclusion about perceived stress relative to the study sample:
Balancing the evidence, the profile contains both meaningful risk factors for elevated perceived stress (notably elevated trait anxiety, objectively and subjectively short/poor sleep, circadian irregularity, late sleep timing, and contextual academic decline) and protective factors (low resting HR/mesor consistent with fitness, frequent exercise, low substance use, and absence of high depressive symptom burden). On balance, the data more strongly support a level of perceived stress that is modestly higher than the study population mean. Stated in the requested terms: the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level is above the population mean (study mean PSS = 21.6). This assessment reflects the relatively strong signal from trait anxiety and sleep/circadian disturbance, tempered by cardiovascular fitness and active coping behaviors. Limitations to note: PSS was not directly provided here, correlations in the dataset are small-to-moderate and do not establish causality, and some wearable metrics are aggregated across days and thus cannot resolve acute versus chronic stress fluctuations."
64232,"Summary and context: The available data combine self-report measures, sleep statistics, and heart-rate–derived circadian features collected across an academic semester. Key self-report signals include a moderately elevated trait-anxiety score (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) and a PSQI score indicating disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59). Wearable-derived circadian measures show reduced interdaily stability (0.22, Z = −1.56) and relatively large variability in sleep timing (sleep start time SD = 150 minutes, Z = 1.48). These converging signals frame the following assessment of factors that tend to index higher versus lower perceived stress, and an integrated judgment of the participant’s likely PSS position relative to the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.6).

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress: Trait anxiety and impaired subjective sleep quality are the most direct self-report indicators linked with higher PSS in this dataset (STAI shows a positive correlation with PSS; PSQI is above the typical clinical cutoff). The participant reports lower momentary happiness (score = 3.0, Z = −0.53) and slightly reduced self-esteem (Rosenberg score = 37, Z = −0.17), both of which align with higher stress in population-level correlations. From wearables, markedly low interdaily stability (Z = −1.56) indicates a less regular day-to-day circadian structure; irregular circadian timing and large variability in sleep start time (Z = 1.48) are behavioral patterns commonly associated with greater perceived stress or poorer stress regulation. Evening/nighttime heart rate deviations (notably positive deviations later in the day and around late evening) and a modestly elevated MESOR (77.33, Z = 0.46) further suggest some elevation of overall cardiovascular tone across the day, which can accompany heightened sympathetic arousal or disrupted recovery.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress or resilience: Several behavioral and physiological markers are inconsistent with a high-stress profile. Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8:00 hours, Z = 1.01) and mean daily nap frequency is effectively zero (Z = −0.86), which can reflect adequate opportunity for nocturnal recovery. The participant reports frequent participation in sports (three times a week or more, Z = 1.58), an activity pattern that is generally associated with lower perceived stress and better mood regulation (correlation in this dataset is modest but negative). Depressive symptom levels are not elevated (CES-D = 13, Z ≈ 0), and resting heart rate is within a typical range (59.4 bpm, Z = 0.15), which argue against pervasive physiological hyperarousal. Moderate social engagement (1–2 hours socializing) and stable academic performance also provide contextual supports for coping capacity.

Integrated evaluation relative to the study sample mean: Balancing the lines of evidence, the pattern is most consistent with a modestly elevated perceived stress level relative to the study population mean. The combination of increased trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, pronounced irregularity in daily timing (low interdaily stability and high sleep-timing variability), and reductions in momentary happiness point toward higher perceived stress; however, protective factors—adequate total sleep time, regular engagement in sports, normal depressive symptom burden, and no frequent naps—temper the magnitude of that elevation. On balance, I infer that this participant’s perceived stress level is likely above the population mean PSS (i.e., above 21.6) but not extreme (more consistent with a mild-to-moderate elevation rather than an outlying high value). This inference should be treated as probabilistic: correlations between many wearable features and PSS are modest, and the heart-rate aggregates are temporally averaged rather than date-specific, limiting fine-grained causal interpretation."
37404,"Summary context: The participant is a female student with generally low self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66; STAI-T = 35, Z = -0.62), near-average self-esteem (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03), good academic performance (GPAs ~3.75–3.8), and modestly positive health satisfaction (Z = 0.13). Median wearable-derived sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 9 minutes (Z ≈ -0.04), with no recorded daytime naps and moderate night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start median 00:48; start-time SD ≈ 65 minutes). These psychological and behavioral indicators form the baseline against which physiological measures are interpreted.

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress: multiple wearable-derived circadian metrics show signs of rhythm instability and blunting that, within this study sample, are associated with higher PSS. Interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = -1.56; correlation with PSS = -0.12), intradaily variability is elevated (0.74, Z = 1.37; corr = 0.16), 24-hour autocorrelation is low (0.14, Z = -1.54; corr = -0.17), and cosinor amplitude is reduced (6.01, Z = -1.54; corr = -0.17). These together indicate a relatively irregular, fragmented heart-rate rhythm and reduced circadian amplitude—patterns that, in this dataset, modestly track with higher perceived stress. The participant’s PSQI score is 7 (above the typical clinical cutoff of 5), indicating subjective sleep disturbance, which commonly associates with greater perceived stress. Resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the sample (60.8 bpm, Z = 0.32; corr with PSS = 0.14), and several nighttime-to-early-morning heart-rate deviations are pronounced; these physiological signs (reduced amplitude, rhythm instability, disturbed subjective sleep, modestly higher RHR) collectively favor an interpretation of somewhat elevated physiological arousal and sleep/circadian dysregulation that have been linked with higher PSS in this cohort.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress: self-report mental-health indices are on the lower side of symptom burden (CES-D and STAI both below sample mean), self-esteem is average, and academic and health-satisfaction indicators are favorable. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone ≥ three times/week, Z = 1.07), minimal recreational drug use, low frequency of sedentary leisure, and no daytime napping — behaviors that generally protect against elevated perceived stress or correlate with lower PSS in the sample. Objective total sleep time is close to the sample average (median ~7h), which reduces the likelihood that chronic short sleep alone is driving a high stress profile. Taken together, these behavioral and self-report features argue for relatively resilient psychosocial functioning compared with peers.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSS: The pattern is mixed. Behavioral self-reports and functioning (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, good GPA, regular exercise, low substance use) suggest perceived stress at or below the sample mean, whereas physiological signals (reduced circadian amplitude, low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, PSQI > 5, and modestly higher resting HR) point toward circadian disruption and sleep disturbance that are associated with higher perceived stress. Balancing these sources, the most consistent interpretation is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62), with a plausible tendency toward being mildly above the mean rather than markedly lower. In other words, the data support an inference of perceived stress “near the mean” or possibly “slightly above the mean,” driven primarily by wearable-derived circadian and sleep disturbance signals despite generally low self-reported symptom scores.

Uncertainty and caveats: Correlations between individual wearable features and PSS in this sample are modest; therefore physiological signs provide suggestive rather than definitive evidence of elevated perceived stress. The discrepancy between low self-reported mood/anxiety and physiological/circadian disturbance could reflect subclinical sleep/circadian effects not yet reflected in symptom scales, transient semester-related demands, or individual differences in symptom reporting. Interpretation would be strengthened by a direct PSS score from the participant and by longitudinal data linking short-term changes in sleep/circadian measures to perceived stress reports."
70492,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of psychological, behavioral and physiological features that together suggest perceived stress modestly above the study sample mean. Trait measures of anxiety (STAI = 49, z = 0.76) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, z = 0.28) are elevated relative to the cohort and both correlate positively with PSS in the study (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28). Several ambulatory and sleep-derived markers—particularly high night-to-night sleep variability, late and irregular sleep timing, and reduced circadian amplitude—align with patterns that have been associated with greater perceived stress. Taken together, these signals most consistently point to perceived stress that is slightly above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61).

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress: 
- Psychological trait measures: The STAI trait score (49; z = 0.76) and the CES-D score (16; z = 0.28) are both elevated and show the strongest positive correlations with PSS among the self-report measures included (r ≈ 0.31 and r ≈ 0.28, respectively), indicating a link between anxious/depressive symptom burden and higher perceived stress for this participant.  
- Sleep timing and variability: Although median nightly sleep duration is near 7 hours (7:05; z = -0.13), sleep timing is very late (median sleep start ≈ 03:03) and highly irregular (sleep duration SD = 222 minutes, z = 2.75; sleep start SD z = 1.21). Greater night-to-night variability and delayed bedtimes are associated in the dataset with higher PSS (sleep variability correlations positive ~0.13–0.17) and are risk factors for increased perceived stress.  
- Circadian and activity fragmentation: Cosinor-derived amplitude and MESOR are lower than average (Amplitude z = -0.44; MESOR z = -0.60), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (z = -0.28). Lower amplitude and reduced 24-hour reliability have negative/weak correlations with PSS and, in combination with the late acrophase (peak heart rate ~5:12 PM), suggest blunted or shifted circadian structure—features often accompanying higher stress or disrupted daily routines.  
- Behavioral factors: Low frequency of exercise and participation in sports, elevated sedentary hobby time (z = 1.41), and relatively frequent beer consumption (1–2×/week, z = 1.01) are behaviors that, in this sample, either weakly associate with higher stress or reduce behavioral resilience, supporting an interpretation of somewhat elevated perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress:
- Adequate median sleep duration and absence of daytime naps: Median sleep duration near 7 hours and mean daily naps ≈ 0 (z = -0.86) are neutral-to-protective with respect to perceived stress—i.e., total sleep time is not markedly short.  
- Positive momentary well-being and some social activity: Self-reported current happiness is above average (Happy = 4.0; z = 0.55) and time socializing with friends is above average (2–3 hours; z = 0.95). Both happiness and social time correlate negatively with PSS in the dataset (happy r ≈ -0.19), suggesting psychosocial resources that can mitigate stress.  
- Physiological resting-heart indicators: Resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than the cohort mean (RHR 53.6 bpm, z = -0.54; MESOR z = -0.60). Lower resting HR can reflect greater cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic sympathetic activation and is not strongly associated with higher PSS (RHR correlation with PSS modestly positive r ≈ 0.14 in the dataset), so these features do not strongly indicate elevated stress and may be protective.

Circadian heart-rate pattern and nocturnal physiology: The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations between ~1:00–8:00 AM, largest around 6–8 AM) and daytime elevations around midday and early afternoon. Several early-morning hourly deviations (e.g., 2–6 AM) show modest positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.21), indicating that aspects of nocturnal heart-rate modulation—possibly deeper or more variable overnight reductions relative to mesor—relate to higher perceived stress in this sample. Non-parametric circadian metrics (interdaily stability slightly above average, intradaily variability near average) indicate a rhythm that is present but irregular; combined with high sleep timing variability and reduced amplitude, this supports an interpretation of circadian instability that has been linked to increased perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population: Balancing the evidence, the profile includes several moderate indicators of elevated perceived stress (notably elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, late and highly variable sleep timing, and reduced circadian amplitude), alongside some mitigating factors (adequate median sleep duration, no naps, low resting heart rate, above-average reported happiness and social time). On net, these signals most consistently point to perceived stress modestly above the population mean rather than markedly higher or substantially lower. Therefore, relative to the study sample mean PSS of 21.61 (SD = 3.68), the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best characterized as slightly above the population mean.

Uncertainty and caveats: This inference integrates cross-sectional, correlational relationships and aggregated wearable metrics; correlations reported in the dataset are moderate at best and do not establish causation. Several wearable metrics are temporally aggregated and cannot resolve within-person, day-to-day dynamics or situational contributors to stress. The conclusion should be considered probabilistic and would be strengthened by a direct PSS score or repeated assessments of stress over time."
95543,"Summary of self-report and affective indicators: The participant’s survey responses consistently indicate low symptom burden and positive well-being relative to the study sample. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 1.0, Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 23, Z = -1.81) are well below the sample mean, sleep quality is rated as good (PSQI = 3, Z = -1.72), and momentary happiness and self-esteem are relatively high (Happy Z = 1.64; Self-Esteem Z = 1.52). Health satisfaction is also above average (Z = 1.3). These self-reported profiles are classic protective signals with respect to perceived stress: they suggest lower negative affect, good subjective sleep, and positive self-evaluation, all of which are associated in the literature and in the study correlations with lower PSS.

Wearable-derived circadian and heart-rate features supporting lower perceived stress: Heart-rate based circadian regularity is relatively strong. Interdaily stability (0.54, Z = 1.08) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.51, Z = 1.57) are elevated, and amplitude is above average (13.2, Z = 0.78). In this dataset these regularity features have small negative correlations with PSS (e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; amplitude r ≈ -0.16), consistent with more-stable circadian structure being associated with lower perceived stress. Nighttime heart-rate deviations show expected drops (large negative deviations between ~1–8am), indicating consolidated periods of lower cardiovascular activity overnight—another physiological pattern typically associated with restorative sleep and lower stress.

Behavioral and lifestyle features that further argue for lower perceived stress: The participant reports minimal substance use, frequent social exercise (exercised with others three times a week or more; Z = 1.23), and moderate daily social/leisure engagement (socializing ~1–2 hours). Sleep duration is within a healthy range (median 7 h 25 m, Z = 0.29) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD 60 min, Z = -0.92), and naps are absent. Academic indicators (high GPAs) and relatively high health satisfaction further align with low perceived stress in this context.

Features that could indicate relatively higher physiological or situational arousal (potentially related to greater perceived stress): Several wearable and behavioral features temper the uniformly low-stress signal. Resting heart rate and mesor are above the study mean (Resting HR 66.7, Z = 1.02; Mesor 82.9, Z = 1.22), and evening heart-rate deviations are pronounced (notably 8–9 pm deviation Z ≈ 2.09). These elevated evening cardiovascular values could reflect late-day activity, social/academic engagement, or residual physiological arousal. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (around 02:25 AM), which may reflect an evening chronotype or late-night obligations; although overall sleep duration and subjective sleep quality are good, a late sleep timing can sometimes be associated with stressors tied to schedule demands or circadian misalignment. Correlations in this dataset modestly link higher resting heart rate to higher PSS (r ≈ 0.14), so these physiological markers are potential signals of elevated arousal, albeit small in magnitude.

Balanced interpretation and limitations: Overall evidence from both self-report and wearable data leans toward lower perceived stress: affective measures (depression, trait anxiety, happiness, self-esteem), subjective sleep quality, social exercise, and strong circadian regularity all point to protection against high PSS. Countervailing signals (slightly elevated mesor and resting HR, strong evening HR peaks, and late sleep timing) suggest some late-evening physiological activation or chronotype-related behaviors that could reflect situational demands or lifestyle patterns rather than chronic stress per se. It is important to note that correlations between these features and PSS in the study are small, the hourly heart-rate values are aggregated across days (so they cannot identify transient stressors), and causal direction cannot be inferred from these data alone.

Holistic conclusion relative to the sample mean: Taking the totality of evidence into account—strong indicators of low affective symptom burden, good subjective sleep, robust circadian regularity, active social exercise, and minimal substance use—this participant’s profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level below the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). While there are modest physiological signs of elevated evening arousal and a late sleep schedule that warrant attention in context, the preponderance of psychological and behavioral signals supports an inference of lower-than-average perceived stress."
67106,"Summary of evidence consistent with lower perceived stress:
Multiple sources converge on an overall low symptom burden in this participant. Self-report mood and trait inventories show notably low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 2, Z = -1.18) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 29, Z = -1.22), together with elevated self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.1) and relatively high self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64). Objective physiology and behavioral regularity from the wearable reinforce this pattern: the participant has strong circadian organization (interdaily stability Z = 1.9, autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 2.07) and low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = -0.53). Resting heart rate is low-normal (56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22), and hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal dip and clear daytime peaks consistent with consolidated sleep and wake periods. These indices (particularly the strong interdaily stability/autocorrelation and the low symptom scores) are directionally associated with lower PSS in the study correlations and therefore provide coherent evidence favoring a perceived-stress level below the study population mean.

Summary of evidence consistent with higher perceived stress:
There are a few behavioral and sleep-related signals that could increase perceived stress vulnerability. The participant’s PSQI classifies their sleep as disturbed (PSQI = 6) and their median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 46 min, Z = -0.51). Sleep onset is late (median start ~01:29 AM) and sleep-start variability is moderate (SD ≈ 88 minutes), which can degrade restorative sleep and is modestly associated with higher PSS in the dataset. Lifestyle measures show very low frequency of physical exercise and minimal socializing, which are behavioral risk factors for stress management even though their direct correlations with PSS in this sample are small. Taken together, disturbed subjective sleep and limited exercise/social interactions are the principal signals here that could push perceived stress upward relative to the otherwise protective profile.

Wearable circadian and heart-rate detail (integrative):
The participant’s cosinor and nonparametric circadian metrics indicate a robust, well-entrained 24-hour heart-rate rhythm (MESOR and amplitude within typical range; acrophase ~4:20 PM; high interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation). The hourly mean heart-rate deviations show deep overnight troughs (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and identifiable daytime elevations, including notable evening elevations (Z > 1 around 6–9 PM). In this cohort these features (strong 24-h structure, clear nocturnal dipping) are associated with lower perceived stress. The physiological pattern thus supports the behavioral self-reports of low affective symptom burden despite some subjective sleep complaints.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population:
Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of indicators points toward lower perceived stress for this participant relative to the study sample. The combination of very low depressive and anxiety scores, high subjective well-being, strong circadian regularity, and a low-normal resting heart rate weighs more heavily than the modest sleep disturbance, late bedtimes, and low exercise frequency. Therefore, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is most consistent with being below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). This inference is probabilistic and tempered by two caveats: (1) the participant’s PSQI > 5 and late sleep timing are credible risk signals that could elevate stress if persistent or if circumstances change, and (2) none of these measures are a direct PSS score in the provided data—interpretation relies on cross-measure associations and cohort correlations, many of which are small. Consider targeted follow-up (direct PSS measurement if absent, monitoring of sleep quality and exercise) if a more definitive assessment is required."
83612,"Summary: The participant’s profile shows a mixture of psychological trait elevations and relatively intact sleep and health behaviors. Trait anxiety (STAI Trait = 58, Z = 1.65) and modest depressive symptoms (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18) are the strongest psychological signals that typically co-occur with higher perceived stress; self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, Z = -1.29), which also tends to track with greater perceived stress. In contrast, subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8), relatively low resting heart rate (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42), modestly positive reported happiness (Z = 0.55) and limited substance use are features that, on balance, are associated with lower perceived stress. Taken together, the multimodal pattern suggests the participant’s perceived stress is elevated relative to protective health behaviors in some domains but is not extreme on the physiological or sleep measures.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher perceived stress: The most salient risk indicators are high trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.65; STAI–PSS correlation ~0.31) and reduced self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.29; correlation with PSS ≈ -0.15). These trait-level measures are robust predictors of higher PSS in the study sample and carry considerable weight because they reflect stable psychological vulnerability rather than transient states. Wearable circadian metrics also suggest less-regular daily physiology: intradaily variability is elevated (IV Z = 1.09, IV–PSS correlation ≈ 0.16) while interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are low (IS Z = -1.07; 24h autocorr Z = -1.29; both correlations in directions indicating that lower rhythm regularity is associated with higher PSS). Night-to-night variability in sleep start time is slightly above average (SD ≈ 84 minutes) and correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.17), which further aligns with markers of higher perceived stress.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress: Several behavioral and physiological markers are consistent with lower PSS. Subjective sleep quality is at or just below the threshold for disturbance (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.8) and median nightly sleep duration is only modestly short (6 h 42 m, Z = -0.59); both metrics have small correlations with PSS in the sample that favor lower perceived stress here. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42) while daytime heart-rate mesor and amplitude are not elevated; lower resting heart rate in this sample tends to associate with lower PSS (correlation small but positive for RHR → PSS, meaning higher RHR relates to higher PSS, so a lower RHR is protective). Lifestyle behaviors that typically buffer stress — low recreational drug use, limited alcohol consumption, regular (if modest) exercise, above-average self-reported happiness and stable high academic performance (GPAs ~3.7–3.82) — further argue against very high perceived stress.

Physiological and daily-pattern synthesis: Heart-rate–based circadian analysis indicates a preserved diurnal peak (acrophase ~4:23 PM) but reduced overall rhythm robustness (lower amplitude and mesor Z-scores slightly negative) with fragmentation across the day (high intradaily variability). Aggregated hourly deviations show clear nocturnal decreases and daytime elevations consistent with sleep and wake, but several pronounced daytime peaks (e.g., midday and late afternoon) and elevated late-evening deviation (9–10 pm Z = 1.33) suggest periods of sustained physiological activation that may reflect work/study demands or evening activities. These circadian irregularities (low stability, high fragmentation) are modestly associated with higher PSS in the cohort and reinforce the psychological signal from anxiety and low self-esteem, even though sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality are not strongly disordered.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Considering the balance of signals—particularly the strong trait anxiety elevation and low self-esteem combined with wearable indicators of circadian fragmentation versus protective factors such as adequate subjective sleep quality, low resting heart rate, limited substance use, and positive academic functioning—the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress is best characterized as above the population mean but not extreme. In other words, the participant likely reports PSS higher than the study mean (population mean PSS = 21.61, SD = 3.68), with the strongest contributors to that elevation being trait anxiety and circadian irregularity, and several behavioral/physiological factors partially mitigating that elevation.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation: This inference integrates correlations observed in the sample and the participant’s z-scores across domains; it does not replace a self-reported PSS measure. Trait measures (STAI, self-esteem) carry more weight for long-term perceived stress, whereas wearable-derived rhythm metrics reflect behavioral-state contributors that can change with schedules or interventions. If the goal is to reduce perceived stress, targeting anxiety management and improving day-to-day schedule regularity (sleep-wake timing and activity structure) would be consistent with the pattern observed here."
92566,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of resilience-related indicators (low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem and happiness, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, low substance use) alongside several sleep-related risk signals (subjective sleep disturbance on the PSQI, objectively short median nightly sleep and elevated night-to-night variability). Circadian measures derived from heart rate are broadly within the study-average range (interdaily stability and intradaily variability near the mean; mesor slightly lower), while hourly heart-rate deviations indicate a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate nadir and an elevated evening physiologic activation window. Taken together, the preponderance of psychological and physiological evidence points toward lower perceived stress than the study sample mean, although sleep irregularities constitute a meaningful countervailing factor.

Features suggesting relatively higher perceived stress (supporting a higher PSS):
- Self-reported and wearable sleep metrics: PSQI = 6 (classified as disturbed sleep) and a median nightly sleep duration of ~6 h 17 min (Z = -1.11) indicate objectively and subjectively reduced sleep quantity. Nightly sleep start time is late (median 00:48) with high variability (SD ≈ 113 minutes, Z = 0.66). Shorter and more variable sleep has modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample and is a known contributor to perceived stress and poor stress recovery.  
- Markers of circadian fragmentation and morning arousal: intradaily variability, while slightly below the sample mean (Z = -0.18), shows a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), and several early-morning hourly heart-rate deviations (e.g., 3–6 AM) show small positive correlations with PSS (r up to ~0.21). These patterns suggest that variation in nocturnal physiology and early-morning arousal are associated with higher perceived stress in this sample.  
- Sleep variability (SD of sleep duration = 120 minutes; Z = 0.43) also shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), indicating that irregular sleep timing/length may be elevating subjective stress for this participant relative to peers.

Features suggesting relatively lower perceived stress (supporting a lower PSS):
- Low mood and anxiety symptom burden: CES-D = 5 (Z = -0.86, classified “not depressed”) and STAI-Trait = 24 (Z = -1.71, “not anxious”) are both substantially below the sample means; these scales are positively correlated with PSS in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so low scores here strongly favor lower perceived stress.  
- Positive psychosocial resources: high self-esteem (Rosenberg RSES Z = 1.38), high current happiness (Z = 1.64), and above-average health satisfaction (Z = 1.22) are all characteristics associated with lower PSS (self-esteem and happiness show negative correlations with PSS in the sample).  
- Behavioral and physiological resilience markers: frequent exercise (exercising alone three times/week or more, Z = 1.07), minimal recreational drug use and low alcohol frequency, and a low resting heart rate (~49 bpm, Z = -1.08) point to good cardiovascular fitness and health behaviors that typically relate to lower perceived stress. Circadian rhythm strength indicators (autocorrelation at 24 hours Z = 0.56; amplitude near the mean), and generally near-average interdaily stability, also support a relatively well-entrained daily structure, which is linked with lower PSS in the sample (autocorrelation shows a negative correlation with PSS).

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the evidence, the participant exhibits multiple robust markers of lower perceived stress (very low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high happiness/self-esteem, good fitness/exercise patterns, and generally intact circadian structure). These protective factors appear to outweigh the sleep-related risk signals (short average sleep, subjective sleep disturbance, and variability in sleep timing), which are likely to exert some upward pressure on perceived stress but do not dominate the overall profile. Therefore, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is most consistent with being below the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68). This conclusion should be considered probabilistic: if an actual PSS score were available it might fall somewhat below the mean, but the observed sleep disturbances suggest there is some vulnerability for stress-related increases over time, particularly during periods of acute demand.

Clinical/research implications (brief): monitoring and, if desired, targeting sleep regularity and total sleep time (consistent bedtimes, strategies to increase nightly sleep duration) would be the most direct avenue to reduce the remaining stress-related risk. Current psychosocial and behavioral resources (low anxiety/depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, frequent exercise) are strengths to leverage in any preventive or supportive intervention."
35987,"Summary: The available multimodal data show a mixed profile in which dispositional anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, late nocturnal timing, and low physical activity stand out as signals that would tend to elevate perceived stress, while strong day-to-day regularity of behavioral/physiological rhythms, a robust circadian amplitude, low resting heart rate, and relatively low depressive symptom burden point in the opposite direction. Trait anxiety (STAI = 51, Z = 0.96) and a PSQI indicating disturbed sleep (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59) are the most salient individual survey markers linked with higher PSS in this dataset; by contrast, the CES-D score is relatively low (10, Z = -0.34), and the participant reports moderate current happiness (4.0, Z = 0.55), both of which are associated with lower perceived stress. Overall, weighing the size and direction of these signals suggests a perceived-stress level that is near—but likely slightly above—the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.62).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI Z ≈ +1.0) and in this sample STAI correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.31), making it a strong risk indicator. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI > 5), and median nightly sleep duration is below the sample average (6 h 32 m, Z = -0.81), both commonly associated with greater perceived stress. The participant’s sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:45) and self-reports low exercise (no regular exercise; exercise Z-scores ~ -1.6 to -1.9), which are behavioral patterns frequently linked to elevated stress or reduced coping capacity. Additional contextual signals that can be construed as stress-related include modestly declining GPAs across semesters and below-average self-esteem (Rosenberg score = 28, Z = -1.43), which produce vulnerability for higher perceived stress in many samples.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Wearable-derived circadian metrics are robust in ways typically associated with resilience. Interdaily stability is high (0.62, Z = +1.74) and circadian amplitude is elevated (amplitude Z ≈ +1.16), indicating consistent daily timing and a pronounced day–night difference in heart-rate activity; in this dataset both features tend to relate to lower PSS (correlations negative). Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.2 bpm, Z ≈ -0.11), which, alongside the large nocturnal heart-rate nadir, suggests preserved nocturnal recovery physiology. The participant reports little recreational drug use and only modest alcohol use (beer 1–2 times/week), and depressive symptoms are low—factors that reduce the likelihood of high perceived stress relative to someone with comorbid depressive symptoms or substance use.

Integration of sleep and circadian physiology: The profile shows a late but stable sleep schedule (median start ~02:45 with relatively low night-to-night variability) and pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (large positive deviations in the 6–11 pm window and very high Z-scores around 9–10 pm). Together these findings indicate a shifted circadian phase with reliable timing: the participant is regularly active late into the evening but maintains consistent timing across days. That pattern can have mixed implications for perceived stress—stable timing and large amplitude are protective, but late timing and limited nocturnal sleep duration (plus subjectively disturbed sleep) are risk factors that may amplify perceived stress, especially in contexts that require earlier-day functioning (e.g., coursework).

Conclusion relative to the study sample: Considering the balance of indicators—elevated trait anxiety and poor subjective sleep on the one hand, and strong interdaily regularity, robust circadian amplitude, low resting heart rate, and low depressive symptoms on the other—the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best characterized as near the population mean PSS, with modest elevation above the mean more likely than a substantially lower-than-average level. In other words, the data are most consistent with perceived stress that is around or slightly above the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62), with trait anxiety and sleep disturbance representing the primary contributors to that relative elevation."
79341,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile contains a mix of subjective, behavioral, and wearable-derived indicators that point in both directions with respect to perceived stress. Self-report measures show modest trait anxiety (STAI = 41, Z ≈ -0.03) and low momentary happiness (self-rated “Happy” = 2, Z = -1.61). Depressive symptoms are low-to-mild (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) and self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11). Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate relatively strong daily regularity (interdaily stability = 0.52, Z = 0.91; autocorrelation at 24h = 0.44, Z = 0.98) and a low resting heart rate (48.25 bpm, Z = -1.18). Sleep quantity by wearable median is modestly below the study mean (median 6 h 46 m, Z = -0.51) with a late typical sleep onset (median start ≈ 01:50). Below I outline features that plausibly relate to higher perceived stress and those that plausibly relate to lower perceived stress, then provide an integrated judgment relative to the study sample mean PSS (mean = 21.63, SD = 3.66).

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: On the self-report side, trait anxiety (STAI) correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), and the participant’s STAI score is at least in the anxious range, which raises the likelihood of elevated perceived stress. Momentary low positive affect (very low self-rated happiness, Z = -1.61; correlation with PSS ≈ -0.20) also points toward greater subjective distress or lower well-being, which often accompanies higher perceived stress. Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:50) and sleep duration is under 7 hours on average; later bedtimes and shorter sleep can contribute to perceived stress or reduce daytime coping capacity even when global sleep quality metrics are not severely elevated. Intradaily variability in heart rate is slightly elevated (intradaily variability = 0.59, Z = 0.32) and this measure shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), suggesting more fragmentation in day–night activity patterns that is sometimes associated with increased stress. Finally, some behavioral habits—limited reading and relatively high video-game time (video games Z = 1.71)—could reflect coping patterns or time-use that correlate with stress in complex ways.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several objective and behavioral indicators point toward lower stress. Circadian regularity measures are relatively strong: interdaily stability (Z ≈ 0.91) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ 0.98) are well above the study mean and correlate negatively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.11 and r ≈ -0.17 respectively), which suggests a protective, organized daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is low (48.3 bpm, Z ≈ -1.18), a physiological sign typically associated with good cardiovascular fitness and lower sympathetic tone; the correlation between RHR and PSS in this sample is small but positive (r ≈ 0.13), so a lower-than-average RHR here argues against high perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z ≈ -0.8) is at or slightly better than the sample mean, indicating no major self-reported sleep disturbance, and objective nocturnal heart rate deviations show pronounced night-time dips consistent with consolidated sleep. Behavioral health habits also include frequent exercise (exercising alone three times or more weekly, Z ≈ 1.07) and minimal substance use, both of which are factors commonly linked to reduced perceived stress or better coping capacity.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample mean: The data present a mixed but overall slightly favorable profile. Objective physiological markers and circadian regularity (notably high interdaily stability and low resting HR) weigh in favor of lower perceived stress, while subjective signals (trait anxiety and low momentary happiness), late sleep timing, and some fragmentation in daily variability point toward increased stress vulnerability. Taking the balance of evidence into account—particularly the strong circadian regularity and low resting heart rate versus modest anxiety and low positive affect—the most consistent overall inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is likely near to modestly below the study population mean (i.e., at or slightly lower than PSS = 21.63). Because the participant’s profile contains countervailing signals, this conclusion should be regarded as probabilistic rather than definitive: subjective anxiety and low positive affect could raise perceived stress in specific contexts even while physiological markers suggest resilience."
83536,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of behavioral regularity and subjective well-being alongside some indicators of late/variable sleep timing and modest circadian fragmentation. Self-report measures of mood and trait anxiety are low (CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97; STAI–Trait = 26, Z = -1.51), self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are relatively high (current happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 1.3), and substance use is minimal. Wearable-derived physiology indicates a relatively low resting heart rate (56.4 bpm, Z = -0.21) and overall circadian mesor and amplitude near the study mean (mesor Z = 0.04; amplitude Z = -0.07). Sleep duration is near average for the sample (median 7 h 5 m, Z = -0.13), though sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 02:25) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = 0.35). Taken together, these data suggest generally preserved mood and physiological recovery with some circadian/timing irregularity.

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress: several markers that correlate positively with PSS (albeit modestly) are present. The participant’s PSQI score of 6 meets the typical threshold for disturbed subjective sleep, which often corresponds to higher perceived stress (PSQI classified as “Disturbed Sleep”; PSQI Z = -0.33 but absolute score >5). Wearable intradaily variability is above average (IV = 0.65, Z = 0.74), indicating more fragmented or less consolidated activity/HR patterns across the day; intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16). The participant’s sleep timing is late (median start ≈ 02:25) and somewhat variable (start-time SD Z = 0.35), and variability in sleep timing shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the dataset. Several early-morning heart-rate deviations (e.g., 3–7 AM) have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample, which could reflect nighttime physiological arousal patterns that modestly co-vary with higher perceived stress.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress: multiple strong indicators of low perceived stress are present. Trait anxiety and depressive symptom burden are low (STAI–Trait Z = -1.51; CES-D Z = -0.97), both of which correlate positively with PSS in the study, making lower scores on those instruments consistent with lower perceived stress. The participant reports high current happiness (Z = 1.64) and high health satisfaction (Z = 1.3), variables that correlate negatively or weakly with PSS and are protective. Objective physiological markers also argue against high stress: resting heart rate is relatively low (56.4 bpm) and common circadian summary measures (mesor, amplitude, interdaily stability) are at or near the sample mean (mesor Z = 0.04; amplitude Z = -0.07; IS Z = 0.0), suggesting preserved circadian structure overall. Lifestyle markers—low substance/recreational drug use, regular moderate exercise, frequent socializing—are additional behavioral factors associated in the literature and in these data with lower perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the evidence, the balance favors an inference of perceived stress that is at or below the study sample mean. The participant’s low trait anxiety and depressive symptoms and relatively high subjective well-being are especially influential signals that typically map onto lower PSS scores. Although there are modest risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, late and somewhat variable sleep timing, and elevated intradaily variability), these effects are smaller in magnitude in this profile and are not accompanied by physiological signs of chronic hyperarousal (resting HR is low; mesor/amplitude are near average). Therefore, the most defensible categorical statement is that the participant’s overall perceived stress is likely below the population mean PSS (sample mean PSS = 21.62). This is a probabilistic inference rather than a direct PSS measurement; given some conflicting signals, the participant may still experience domain-specific or situational stressors not captured by global trait measures.

Caveats and recommendations: correlations reported in the dataset are generally small, and no direct PSS score for this participant was provided here, so the conclusion is inferential. Late habitual sleep timing and subjective sleep disturbance merit monitoring given their modest associations with higher perceived stress; targeted sleep timing consistency or sleep-quality interventions (behavioral sleep regularity, stimulus control) could reduce that risk if elevated stress is of concern. If a definitive assessment of perceived stress is needed, direct administration of the PSS to the participant (and repeated measurement to capture temporal fluctuations) would be the most precise next step."
67608,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of psychosocial strengths (low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, above-average self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise and strong academic performance) alongside objective markers of circadian fragmentation and delayed sleep timing (late habitual sleep onset and pronounced evening heart-rate elevations). Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests that the participant’s perceived stress level is likely at or below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62), but with meaningful physiological and sleep-related features that could reflect situational or behavioral strain. The following paragraphs detail evidence that points toward relatively higher perceived stress and evidence that points toward relatively lower perceived stress, and then integrate these data into a holistic inference.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The participant’s wearable-derived circadian metrics show elevated intradaily variability (value 0.77, Z = 1.58), a feature that in this sample correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16) and that indicates greater fragmentation of heart-rate rhythms across the day — a pattern that has been associated with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is also somewhat disturbed (PSQI = 7; classification “Disturbed Sleep”), and later habitual sleep onset (median sleep start ≈ 01:14 AM) together with a marked evening heart-rate elevation (8–9pm deviation +22.8, Z = 2.32) suggest a delayed and physiologically aroused evening period; late/shifted sleep timing and evening autonomic activation can be associated with increased stress or with behaviors that undermine recovery. In addition, relatively low levels of socializing (reported socializing time “15 minutes or less,” Z = -2.20) indicate limited social engagement/support, which can be a contextual vulnerability for greater perceived stress even when other personal resources are intact.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Self-report measures point strongly toward an overall low internal symptom burden: CES-D = 1 (Z = -1.28; classified “Not depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 26 (Z = -1.51; “not anxious”), indicating minimal depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms in the week/trait window assessed. Self-esteem (Rosenberg) is relatively high (Z = 0.96) and current happiness is elevated (score 5.0, Z = 1.64), both of which correlate negatively or weakly with PSS in the sample and are protective against perceived stress. Behavioral health assets include regular exercise (exercised alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07), low recreational drug use, few naps (mean daily naps 0.12, Z = 0.61 but small), stable sleep duration (median ~7 h 12 min; duration SD = 58 min, Z = -0.98) and low variability in sleep start time (SD 26 minutes, Z = -1.24). Objective cardiovascular indicators also suggest good baseline autonomic health: resting heart rate 53.6 bpm (Z = -0.54) and a relatively low MESOR (Z = -0.78), which in this sample are not strongly associated with higher PSS and generally reflect fitness or lower basal arousal.

Holistic integration and comparative statement: On balance, the psychosocial and subjective-report evidence (very low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise and academic success) point toward a perceived stress level below the sample mean. Physiological and circadian evidence (elevated intradaily variability, late sleep timing, pronounced evening HR elevation, and PSQI > 5) indicate some circadian/behavioral patterns that are commonly associated with increased stress or reduced recovery capacity. Because the strongest and most direct predictors of perceived stress in this dataset are the self-reported mood/anxiety measures and self-evaluations (which here are favorable), the most defensible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is below the population mean PSS (i.e., below 21.62), but with detectable behavioral/physiological signatures that warrant monitoring. In short: psychological self-report suggests lower perceived stress relative to peers, while some objective sleep/circadian markers indicate potential situational or behavioral strain that could raise perceived stress under increased load.

Key caveats and recommended interpretation: This inference synthesizes correlational associations and cross-sectional summaries rather than a direct PSS score for the participant; thus it is probabilistic. Several objective markers (intradaily variability, evening HR spike, PSQI) could reflect behavioral choices (late bedtime, evening activity, alcohol use 1–2×/week) rather than stable stress per se, and social context (low reported socializing) may moderate future stress vulnerability. If the research aim is to better predict or monitor PSS for this participant, combining a direct PSS assessment with short-term ecological sampling of sleep timing and evening arousal (e.g., HR, activity, caffeine/alcohol timing) would be the most informative next step."
19735,"Overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of affective symptom burden, late-timed sleep behavior, reduced social/recreational engagement, and a generally robust but somewhat irregular heart‑rate circadian pattern. Several self-report indicators that are known to correlate with perceived stress are elevated (notably depressive symptoms and trait anxiety), while some wearable-derived physiological markers (low resting heart rate, relatively high circadian amplitude, and adequate median sleep duration) are comparatively protective. Taken together, the balance of evidence is most consistent with a level of perceived stress that is above the study sample mean.

Factors indicating relatively high perceived stress
- Affect and trait measures: The CES-D score is 34 (Z = 2.15), a substantially elevated level of depressive symptoms that correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.29). Trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) is also above average and similarly positively associated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Both of these affective signals are among the strongest psychological predictors of higher perceived stress in the dataset.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and late sleep timing: The PSQI score is 6 (classified here as disturbed sleep), and the participant’s median sleep start time is late (≈ 02:01 AM). Later sleep timing and subjective sleep problems are both linked in the literature to elevated stress and mood symptoms; in this sample the variability in sleep start time has a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.17).
- Behavioral/social indicators: The participant reports very limited socializing (≈ 15 minutes or less; Z ≈ -2.2) and minimal recreational media or group exercise. Low social engagement and reduced leisure activities can accompany or exacerbate perceived stress and depressive symptoms. Recreational drug use (reported ~1–2 times/month) has an unusually high Z-score relative to the study population (Z ≈ 3.52), which may reflect a coping-related behavior even though its direct correlation with PSS in this sample is small.
- Circadian regularity concern: The wearable’s autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z ≈ -0.95), and lower 24-hour autocorrelation is modestly associated with higher PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.17). Low day‑to‑day persistence in the heart‑rate rhythm can signal irregular routines that relate to stress.

Factors indicating relatively low perceived stress (protective signals)
- Adequate objective sleep duration: Median sleep duration by wearable is near eight hours (7 h 48 m; Z ≈ 0.77). In this sample, median sleep duration has little relationship with PSS (r ≈ -0.04), but objectively sufficient total sleep is generally protective against elevated perceived stress.
- Cardiorespiratory fitness indicator: Resting heart rate is relatively low (50.3 bpm; Z ≈ -0.93). Lower resting heart rate often reflects higher cardiovascular fitness and in many contexts is associated with resilience; in this dataset resting heart rate has only a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), so the low value here is a modest protective marker.
- Strong circadian amplitude and modest fragmentation: Cosinor amplitude is relatively high (amplitude Z ≈ 1.13), which in the sample relates weakly to lower PSS (r ≈ -0.16). Intradaily variability is slightly below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.25), suggesting limited short‑term fragmentation of the heart‑rate rhythm—another feature generally consistent with orderly daily structure and lower stress.

Wearable heart‑rate timing and sleep architecture interpretation
- Heart-rate timing shows a pronounced nocturnal drop (approximately 20–25 bpm below the mesor between roughly 3–7 AM) and a daytime peak in the late afternoon to early evening (acrophase ≈ 5:26 PM). The large nocturnal decline indicates clear sleep‑related autonomic downregulation, consistent with the objectively adequate sleep duration. However, the participant’s sleep onset is late (median 2:01 AM) and sleep timing variability (SD ≈ 77 minutes) is nontrivial; combined with the low 24‑hour autocorrelation, this pattern suggests that although nightly sleep quantity is sufficient on average, the timing and day-to-day regularity of sleep/wake cycles are suboptimal — a pattern that can contribute to perceived stress and mood symptoms despite adequate duration.
- Circadian regularity metrics are mixed: interdaily stability is near the mean (0.42, Z ≈ 0.09) indicating some day‑to‑day regularity, but the low 24‑hour autocorrelation implies weaker retention of that pattern across consecutive days. The coexistence of high amplitude and reduced 24‑hour persistence suggests robust within-day rhythm strength but inconsistent timing across days — an arrangement that may be less protective than a high‑amplitude rhythm with strong day‑to‑day consistency.

Behavioral/lifestyle context that moderates interpretation
- Limited social and group activities, minimal recreational screen time, and infrequent group exercise point toward an inward or solitary behavioral profile. While low socializing can reduce some day‑to‑day sources of stress, in this context the combination with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms indicates it is more likely a marker of reduced social support or withdrawal rather than lower life stress.
- Academic performance (historical GPAs provided) appears strong, which may reflect intact cognitive/academic functioning and could buffer some domains of perceived stress. However, the prominence of affective symptoms and the use of recreational substances suggest that academic success is co-occurring with internal distress rather than replacing it.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the data indicate that this participant is likely experiencing perceived stress above the study sample mean. The most influential indicators pointing to higher perceived stress are substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 34, Z = 2.15) and above‑average trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56), supported by disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6), late and somewhat inconsistent sleep timing, low social engagement, and signs of circadian irregularity (low 24‑hour autocorrelation). Protective features—adequate objective sleep duration, low resting heart rate, and relatively high circadian amplitude—attenuate but do not offset the strength of the psychological risk signals. In relation to the study sample PSS distribution (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the combined profile is best characterized as above the population mean for perceived stress."
59207,"Summary and context
Across self-report and wearable domains the participant presents a mixed profile: objective physiology and activity patterns point to a well-entrained circadian system and regular daytime structure, while subjective sleep complaints, late and variable sleep timing, and modestly reduced momentary well-being point to potential sources of strain. When these features are weighed against the study population distribution (population mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the overall pattern is most consistent with a perceived-stress level near the sample mean, leaning modestly below it.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, Z ≈ 0.59; classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) is a notable indicator of strain. Poor subjective sleep quality is commonly associated with higher perceived stress, and this participant’s PSQI is above the usual clinical cutpoint.  
- Sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:35 AM) and highly variable (sleep start SD Z ≈ 1.27; sleep duration SD Z ≈ 1.55). High night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is correlated in this dataset with higher PSS (sleep SD correlation ≈ 0.14–0.17) and can contribute to feelings of stress or reduced recovery despite adequate mean sleep duration.  
- Momentary affect shows modestly lower self-reported happiness (current happiness Z ≈ -0.53; happiness correlates negatively with PSS), which, together with disturbed subjective sleep, points to psychosocial strain that can increase perceived stress.  
- Some physiological markers that weakly align with greater stress are present: resting heart rate is slightly above the sample average (61.4 bpm, Z ≈ 0.39) and several early-morning heart-rate deviations during sleep correlate positively (small magnitudes) with PSS; these patterns are consistent with a modestly higher sympathetic tone or incomplete nocturnal recovery in some people.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Scores on depression and trait-anxiety scales are below the sample mean (CES-D = 10, Z ≈ -0.34; STAI-Trait = 37, Z ≈ -0.43). Both measures correlate positively with PSS in the sample (CES-D correlation ≈ 0.28; STAI ≈ 0.31), so relatively lower symptom levels argue for lower perceived stress relative to the population.  
- Self-esteem and overall health satisfaction are comparatively elevated (Rosenberg self-esteem Z ≈ 0.68; health satisfaction Z ≈ 1.3), traits that are associated in this dataset with lower PSS (self-esteem correlation ≈ -0.15).  
- Behavioral and wearable circadian metrics show strong, regular rhythms: high interdaily stability (Z ≈ 1.24), low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -2.08), elevated amplitude (Z ≈ 1.05), and a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dip. These features indicate consistent day-to-day structure and low within-day fragmentation; in the study these rhythm-strength metrics are generally associated with lower PSS (e.g., interdaily stability and amplitude correlate negatively with PSS).  
- Lifestyle behaviors supportive of lower perceived stress are present: regular exercise (exercising alone ≥ three times per week, Z ≈ 1.07), minimal recreational drug use, no regular naps, and substantial median nightly sleep duration (median ≈ 8 h 13 min, Z ≈ 1.28). These factors typically buffer against perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean
Weighing opposing signals, the participant shows physiological and behavioral markers of a well-structured daily routine and relatively low affective symptom burden (both pointing toward lower PSS), but also reports subjective sleep problems and exhibits pronounced irregularity in sleep timing/duration (both pointing toward higher PSS). The wearable circadian indices (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high amplitude) are particularly strong objective indicators of stable daily organization and have relatively robust negative associations with PSS in this sample; they therefore carry notable weight in the multimodal synthesis. Conversely, subjective sleep disturbance and variability—while important—are partially offset by long median sleep and stable daytime structure.

Given this balance, the best-supported inference is that the participant’s perceived stress level is near the study sample mean PSS (21.62), with a tendency slightly below the mean rather than substantially above it. In other words: near the population mean, leaning modestly below.

Practical implications based on the profile
- Sleep timing regularity and subjective sleep quality are plausible targets for reducing perceived stress further. Interventions that consolidate sleep timing (earlier, more consistent sleep onset) and address components of subjective sleep quality could align objective rest with subjective experience.  
- Existing strengths—regular exercise, strong circadian rhythmicity, low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, and high health satisfaction—are protective factors and reasonable areas to sustain. Monitoring resting heart rate and subjective sleep complaints over time would help detect whether the modest physiological signals of strain emerge or resolve alongside changes in sleep consistency or life stressors.

Limitations
This interpretation integrates cross-sectional and aggregated wearable metrics and correlations from the study sample; it does not substitute for a direct, contemporaneous PSS score. Correlations shown are modest in magnitude, so individual variability and unmeasured contextual factors (e.g., exam periods, acute life events) may shift perceived stress above or below the inferred level."
96613,"Summary: The multimodal profile presents a mix of signals, but overall the balance of evidence suggests this participant is likely experiencing perceived stress at or below the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.61). Trait symptom scores (depression and anxiety) are well below sample averages, objective cardiovascular and sleep-duration indicators show generally favorable patterns (low resting heart rate, robust day–night amplitude, long median sleep), and several behavioral markers indicate social and physical activity. Against that, there are modest signals consistent with elevated day-to-day fragmentation and some subjective sleep disturbance and late timing that could contribute to perceived stress. Below I summarize the main indicators that point toward higher versus lower perceived stress, describe circadian and sleep physiology, and give an integrated judgment with caveats.

Factors that point toward relatively higher perceived stress
- Subjective sleep quality: The PSQI score is 6 (classified here as “Disturbed Sleep”), which is above the typical clinical threshold; although this PSQI has a modest negative z-score (−0.33) relative to the study sample, a PSQI >5 is commonly associated with greater stress and poorer daytime functioning. The PSQI -> PSS correlation in this dataset is modest but relevant.
- Rhythm fragmentation and variability: Intradaily variability is elevated (value 0.64, z = 0.67) and has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16). Higher intradaily variability typically reflects more fragmented activity/physiological patterns across the day and has been associated with greater perceived stress in this cohort.
- Late sleep timing: Median sleep start is late (≈01:31 AM). Later sleep timing can be associated with social and circadian misalignment and has small positive associations with stress-related measures in this dataset (sleep-start variability correlation with PSS ≈ 0.17). The participant does, however, show relatively low variability in start times (SD 34 minutes, z = −1.06), so timing is late but not highly inconsistent.
- Behavioral contributors: Some leisure patterns (sedentary hobby time z = 1.41; video gaming and TV viewing above average) together with beer use reported 1–2 times/week (z = 1.01) are behavioral features that, in population studies, can co-occur with stress-related coping behaviors. Correlations between these specific items and PSS are small here, so their contribution is likely modest.

Factors that point toward relatively lower perceived stress
- Low trait internalizing symptoms: CES-D = 7 (z = −0.66) and STAI–Trait = 34 (z = −0.72) are both below the sample mean and classify the participant as having low current depressive and trait anxiety symptoms. In this dataset CES-D and STAI scores have positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.28 and 0.31 respectively), so their low values argue for lower perceived stress.
- High self-regard and health satisfaction: Rosenberg self-esteem is elevated (z ≈ 0.96) and reported health satisfaction is high (z ≈ 1.05); self-esteem correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), and greater health satisfaction tends to align with lower perceived stress in the cohort.
- Favorable cardiovascular baseline and circadian amplitude: Resting heart rate is relatively low (47.8 bpm, z = −1.23), and cosinor-derived amplitude is relatively high (amplitude = 14.68, z = 1.26). Higher amplitude (larger day–night difference) is negatively correlated with PSS here (r ≈ −0.17), and a low resting HR generally indicates good cardiovascular fitness/parasympathetic tone, which is consistent with lower physiological burden.
- Adequate and regular sleep duration: Objective median sleep duration is long (8 h 29 min, z = 1.61) and sleep-start times are relatively consistent (sleep start SD z = −1.06). Longer, regular sleep quantity is typically protective against perceived stress; the sleep-duration → PSS correlation here is small and negative (r ≈ −0.05), but in combination with other markers this supports reduced perceived stress.
- Social and exercise behaviors: The participant reports exercising with others three times a week or more (z = 1.23) and modest socializing (1–2 hours daily, near average). Social exercise and engagement are generally associated with lower perceived stress.

Circadian and physiological pattern interpretation
- The cosinor summary shows a robust daily rhythm with an acrophase around 5:26 PM and high amplitude, indicating clear daytime elevation in heart rate relative to nighttime. The aggregated hourly deviations show deep nighttime troughs (large negative deviations overnight, e.g., −26 bpm at 6–7 AM) and pronounced afternoon peaks (positive deviations, notably 2–4 PM). These patterns—strong amplitude and distinct night-time troughs—are typical of a well-entrained circadian profile and are linked here to lower PSS (amplitude r ≈ −0.17, interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12). Interdaily stability is slightly above average (value 0.45, z = 0.33), suggesting moderate day-to-day regularity; however, intradaily fragmentation is elevated (z = 0.67), indicating within-day irregularity that could reflect variable activity bouts or schedule interruptions.
- Resting HR is low relative to the cohort (z = −1.23). Low resting HR plus large amplitude commonly reflect better cardiovascular fitness and stronger circadian organization—both factors aligned with lower perceived stress in the sample—even though resting HR correlates modestly and positively with PSS in these data (r ≈ 0.14), which may reflect sample-specific nuances.

Integrated conclusion and comparison to the sample mean
- Balancing the evidence, the participant shows several substantive indicators consistent with lower perceived stress (low CES-D and STAI scores, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, strong circadian amplitude, long and reasonably regular objective sleep, low resting HR, and regular social exercise). Offsetting these are moderate indicators that could elevate perceived stress (subjective sleep disturbance on PSQI, late sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability, and some sedentary/leisure patterns). The magnitude of the indicators favoring lower stress appears larger and more consistent than those favoring higher stress.
- Therefore, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s overall perceived stress is likely below the study population mean PSS score of 21.61 (i.e., “below the population mean”), though not necessarily extremely low. This judgment carries uncertainty: many correlations with PSS in the sample are modest in size, the wearable heart-rate metrics are aggregated across days (limiting detection of transient stress episodes), and subjective-discrepancy (long objective sleep vs. PSQI-defined disturbance) suggests there may be domain-specific distress that does not fully align with trait measures.

Caveats and suggested follow-up
- The dataset contains mostly small-to-moderate correlations with PSS; individual prediction is therefore imprecise. If more precise assessment is needed, triangulation with an actual PSS score for this participant, repeated momentary stress ratings, or contextual diary data (timing of academic deadlines, episodic events, caffeine/alcohol timing) would reduce uncertainty. Monitoring subjective sleep complaints and daytime functioning despite long sleep duration could clarify whether sleep quality (rather than quantity) is contributing to stress."
50766,"Summary and overall impression:
Taken together, the multimodal data paint a mixed but internally consistent picture of a participant whose physiological rhythms and objective sleep quantity suggest relatively well-regulated day–night physiology, while some self-report and behavioral indicators point to pockets of psychosocial strain (late sleep timing, subjective sleep disturbance, limited social/leisure time). Balancing these sources, the overall pattern is most consistent with a level of perceived stress that is near the study population mean, with a modest tilt toward being slightly below the mean rather than substantially above it.

Factors that point toward relatively lower perceived stress:
- Robust, regular circadian physiology. Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show high interdaily stability (Z = +1.41) and strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = +1.57), together with a large amplitude (Z = +1.63). These features (and their negative correlations with PSS) typically index stable daily structure and are associated here with lower PSS in the sample, suggesting the participant maintains a regular and consolidated activity/rest schedule that is protective against high perceived stress.  
- Preserved cardiovascular markers. Resting heart rate is relatively low (58.1 bpm, Z ≈ 0), and overnight heart-rate troughs are pronounced, indicating normal nocturnal autonomic down-regulation rather than chronic sympathetic elevation. These findings support the notion of physiologic recovery across nights rather than sustained arousal.  
- Adequate objective sleep duration and low sleep variability. Median sleep duration (~7 h 29 m, Z = +0.37) and modest night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = -0.63; duration SD near the mean) point to sufficient sleep quantity and consistent timing, both of which correlate weakly in the sample with lower perceived stress.  
- Low trait symptom burden and positive self-evaluations. Self-report scores for depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43) are below the sample mean, and self-esteem is relatively elevated (RSES Z = +0.68). These self-report indicators tend to align with lower concurrent perceived stress in the cohort.

Factors that point toward relatively higher perceived stress:
- Subjective sleep disturbance and late sleep timing. The participant’s PSQI score is 7 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), and the median sleep start is late (approximately 01:27 AM). A mismatch of subjective sleep problems despite adequate objective duration can indicate sleep quality complaints that relate to stress or lingering arousal, and PSQI has a positive (albeit modest) association with PSS in the sample.  
- Limited daytime social and recreational engagement. Self-reported socializing and many leisure activities are at the low end of the sample distribution (e.g., socializing Z = -2.20), which can reflect constrained social support or reduced restorative leisure time; such behavioral patterns can contribute to increased perceived stress or reduce resilience to stressors.  
- Behavioral markers potentially reflecting coping or demand. Moderate weekly alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ +1.0) and very frequent group exercise (exercising with others 3+×/week, Z = +1.23) suggest both social/behavioural coping strategies and potential performance or social demands. The net effect of these behaviors on perceived stress is ambiguous in the cohort (small correlations), but they are worth noting as contributors that could either mitigate or reflect situational strain.  
- Lower momentary happiness. A self-report “Happy” score is below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.53), which modestly aligns with higher PSS in the population and suggests some reduction in subjective well-being concurrent with the other signals.

Synthesis and conclusion relative to the study population:
Objective physiological measures (strong circadian amplitude and stability, normal resting HR and clear nocturnal decline, adequate sleep duration) and low trait-level affective symptom scores provide convergent evidence for resilience factors that are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Countervailing evidence—chiefly subjective sleep disturbance, very late sleep timing, and minimal social/leisure engagement—points to domain-specific vulnerabilities that could elevate perceived stress in certain contexts (e.g., during academic deadlines or social isolation). On balance, the integrated evidence supports an inference that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study sample mean (Population PSS mean = 21.62), with a slight tendency toward being below the mean rather than clearly above it. This conclusion is probabilistic: specific situational stressors (timing of surveys, recent events) could shift self-reported PSS transiently, and the subjective sleep complaints and low social time are features to monitor as possible early indicators of rising perceived stress.

Uncertainty and recommendations for interpretation:
Correlations between single measures and PSS in the sample are modest and do not establish causation. Given the mixed signals, the most defensible interpretation is cautious: the participant shows several physiologic and trait-level indicators protective against high perceived stress, but several behavioral and subjective indicators merit attention as potential contributors to stress in the near term. Follow-up measurement of momentary stress (PSS score at other timepoints), qualitative context about late sleep timing and social constraints, and targeted assessment of sleep quality would help reduce uncertainty."
71089,"Summary synthesis: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mixture of psychological symptom elevations and resilient behavioral/physiological regulation. Trait measures indicate modestly elevated internalizing symptoms (STAI trait = 46, z ≈ +0.46; CES-D = 16, z ≈ +0.28) and comparatively low self‑esteem (RSES = 27, z ≈ −1.57). Wearable-derived circadian metrics are relatively strong and regular (high interdaily stability z ≈ +1.33, high 24‑h autocorrelation z ≈ +1.23, low intradaily variability z ≈ −0.81), and objective sleep shows long, consistent nightly durations (median 8 h 12 min, z ≈ +1.26; sleep start SD z ≈ −0.96). Cardiac indicators show an elevated average level of cardiovascular activation (MESOR z ≈ +1.77; resting HR = 71.2 bpm, z ≈ +1.55). Taken together, the data point to co-occurring signals of emotional distress and physiological activation alongside robust day‑to‑day circadian organization and objectively adequate sleep duration.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher perceived stress: Several psychosocial and physiological features that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress are present. Trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are above the sample mean (STAI and CES‑D z’s +0.46 and +0.28), and self‑reported happiness and health satisfaction are below the sample mean (happiness z ≈ −0.53; health satisfaction z ≈ −1.45), which align with small-to-moderate correlations these measures have with PSS in the sample. The participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 6, above the common clinical cut point), and reports virtually no exercise (exercise frequency z’s down to ≈ −1.9), both of which are commonly linked with higher perceived stress. Objective cardiovascular indices are elevated (MESOR and resting HR substantially positive z-scores), which may reflect greater baseline physiological arousal; resting HR has a positive correlation with PSS in the study. Behavioral patterns such as high internet usage and substantial sedentary leisure (internet z ≈ +1.52; sedentary hobby z ≈ +1.41) further comport with lifestyle factors that, in this sample, are modestly associated with higher perceived stress.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress: Other features are protective or inconsistent with high perceived stress. The participant’s sleep is objectively long and temporally stable (median duration z ≈ +1.26; low night‑to‑night variability z ≈ −0.85), and circadian rhythm metrics indicate strong organization (interdaily stability and 24‑h autocorrelation both strongly positive), which in the study are associated with lower stress or better regulation. Intradaily variability is low (z ≈ −0.81), suggesting limited fragmentation of activity across the day — another pattern that typically corresponds with lower perceived stress. Social time is not negligible (socializing ~2–3 hours, z ≈ +0.95), and academic performance is strong (GPAs in the high 3.5–3.86 range), both of which can be sources of social support and competence that mitigate perceived stress. The wearable heart‑rate amplitude is above average (amplitude z ≈ +0.83), and in the sample a larger amplitude is associated with lower PSS, which may reflect preserved day/night contrast in autonomic activity.

Holistic inference relative to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the pattern suggests that the participant’s perceived stress is likely near to modestly above the study population mean rather than clearly below it. The presence of elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, low self‑esteem, disturbed subjective sleep, low physical activity, and elevated resting cardiac metrics push the inference upward; the relatively strong and regular circadian organization plus objectively long and consistent sleep and reasonable social/academic engagement exert a mitigating effect. Using the study mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68) as the reference, the participant most consistently profiles as “near to slightly above the population mean” for perceived stress rather than substantially below it.

Caveats: This inference integrates cross‑sectional self‑report items and aggregated wearable metrics and does not substitute for a direct PSS score or clinical assessment. Several associations in the dataset are small in magnitude; therefore, the conclusion emphasizes probabilistic directionality rather than a precise quantitative PSS estimate."
22688,"Summary: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a profile characterized primarily by markers that are associated with lower perceived stress, with a smaller set of physiological rhythm features that plausibly pull in the opposite direction. On balance — given low depression and trait-anxiety scores, favorable sleep quantity/quality, high self-reported happiness and self-esteem, and frequent social exercise — the participant’s inferred perceived stress is most consistent with being below the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.61). The following paragraphs detail the specific evidence that supports lower versus higher perceived stress and then synthesize these findings.

Features consistent with lower perceived stress: Several robust self-report indicators point toward lower perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D (5) and STAI–Trait (27) scores are well below study population means (negative z-scores), indicating few depressive symptoms and low chronic anxiety proneness. Self-esteem and current happiness ratings are notably above average (positive z-scores), and overall health satisfaction is high — all psychosocial resources that are typically associated with lower perceived stress. Sleep behavior from the wearable supports a resilient pattern: a median nightly sleep duration of ~8 hours (z ≈ +1.05), relatively low night-to-night start-time variability, and a PSQI at or just below the conventional cut point (PSQI = 5) together indicate adequate and subjectively acceptable sleep. Behavioral routines that provide social support and activity — notably exercising with others three or more times per week (z ≈ +1.23) — further align with protective factors against stress. Finally, low usage of recreational or non-prescribed drugs and modest alcohol use reduce several common behavioral risk factors for elevated perceived stress.

Features that could indicate relatively higher perceived stress: A subset of wearable circadian metrics suggests reduced regularity or blunted physiological rhythm amplitude, which in prior work has been associated with greater perceived stress. Specifically, interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are low (z-scores ≈ -1.15 and -1.79, respectively), and cosinor amplitude is reduced (z ≈ -0.66). These features reflect weaker day-to-day regularity and a smaller day–night amplitude of heart rate, which can be linked to stress-related dysregulation. Resting heart rate is slightly above the study mean (≈60.4 bpm, z ≈ +0.27) and some early-morning heart rate deviations show weak positive correlations with PSS — together suggesting a modest physiological arousal signal. It is important to note that the magnitudes of these circadian deviations and their study correlations are moderate-to-small, and intradaily variability (a marker of within-day fragmentation) is actually lower than average here (z ≈ -1.8), which would not typically indicate fragmentation-related stress.

Synthesis and overall inference relative to the sample mean: Balancing the evidence, the stronger and more consistent indicators point to a lower-than-average perceived stress level. Multiple self-report scales that directly index mood and anxiety (CES-D, STAI) are well below population means, self-reported happiness and self-esteem are above average, sleep quantity is generous and regular, and social exercise is frequent — all weighted more heavily in predicting lower PSS than the modest circadian irregularities that point in the opposite direction. Therefore the most plausible inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is below the study population mean PSS of 21.61 (i.e., “below the population mean”). This conclusion should be treated as probabilistic: the wearable circadian markers suggest some physiological irregularity that could increase vulnerability to stress under challenge, so monitoring or interventions that promote stronger daily regularity (consistent sleep–wake timing, stabilized activity rhythms) could be beneficial even in the context of generally low self-reported distress.

Limitations: The inference above is integrative rather than definitive — wearable–PSS correlations in this dataset are generally small, and a direct PSS score for the participant was not provided. Self-report and wearable measures capture related but distinct constructs (subjective stressors, affective state, and physiological rhythm), and each has method-specific noise. These analyses therefore prioritize convergent signals across modalities while noting areas of internal inconsistency for follow-up."
38815,"Summary: The available self-report and wearable data portray a participant with a mixed profile of protective resources and stress-related signals. Trait anxiety (STAI-trait = 43) and modest depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11) co-occur with generally positive well-being indicators (above-average happiness and health satisfaction, regular exercise, preserved self-esteem). Wearable-derived physiology shows a low resting heart rate and reasonably robust daytime/afternoon heart rate amplitude but also reduced day-to-day circadian stability and elevated within-day variability. Taken together, these patterns suggest perceived stress that is not extreme but shows multiple indicators of strain; relative to the study sample mean PSS (21.61), the net pattern is closest to the population mean (near the mean), with a modest tilt toward elevated stress on a subset of risk measures.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress: Several measures that empirically correlate with higher PSS in the study point toward increased perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) is the strongest self-report correlate provided (score correlation with PSS ≈ 0.31) and is explicitly classified as “anxious,” which supports a tendency toward greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and objectively variable sleep (sleep duration SD ≈ 136 minutes, Z ≈ 0.8) both align with stress-linked sleep disruption. Circadian instability metrics—reduced interdaily stability (0.31, Z = -0.82) and relatively elevated intradaily variability (0.56, Z = 0.10)—also point to less consistent daily rhythms, a pattern that has been associated with higher perceived stress (correlations with PSS provided are small-to-moderate in the expected directions). Increased late-afternoon heart rate deviations (notably the 4–5pm aggregate deviation, Z = 2.06) and higher-than-average internet use (3–4 hours/day, Z = 1.52) are additional behavioral/physiological signals that can accompany higher perceived stress or sustained arousal.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress: Several behavioral and physiological indicators suggest resilience or lower stress burden. The participant reports higher-than-average health satisfaction (5.67/7, Z ≈ 1.05) and above-average momentary happiness (current = 4, Z ≈ 0.55), both of which are associated with lower PSS in the sample (negative correlations reported). Self-esteem is high (RSES = 38) and activity choices include frequent solo exercise (three+ times/week, Z ≈ 1.07), which are typically protective against perceived stress. Objective cardiovascular fitness markers—low resting heart rate (47.5 bpm, Z ≈ -1.27) and relatively large heart-rate amplitude (amplitude = 12.58, Z ≈ 0.58)—are physiological features often seen in less stressed or well-conditioned individuals and, in this dataset, amplitude correlates weakly in the direction of lower PSS. Substance and recreational drug use are minimal, and academic performance (GPA series) is strong, which are additional indicators of functional adaptation.

Physiological/circadian detail and how it informs perceived stress: The cosinor-derived circadian picture is mixed. Mesor (average heart rate) is low (65.9 bpm, Z ≈ -1.10), consistent with a low baseline cardiovascular load, while amplitude and a late-afternoon acrophase (~5:55 PM) indicate a clear daily rise in cardiovascular activity concentrated in the afternoon/evening. However, reduced interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours (autocorr24 = 0.26, Z ≈ -0.53) indicate that this rhythm is not highly regular from day to day; intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.56) is slightly elevated. This combination—good fitness/lower resting HR but inconsistent timing—suggests physiological capacity to tolerate stress coexisting with irregular schedules or variable behavior (sleep times, daily demands) that may contribute to perceived stress. Sleep timing is relatively late (median start ~00:50) and moderately inconsistent (sleep start SD ≈ 67 minutes), which dovetails with the circadian instability signal and the subjective PSQI score.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to sample mean PSS: Balancing risk signals (trait anxiety, disturbed/variable sleep, circadian instability, some daytime arousal peaks) against protective factors (high health satisfaction, momentary happiness, high self-esteem, regular exercise, low resting heart rate), the overall profile is best characterized as near the study population mean for perceived stress, with a modest lean toward elevated stress rather than clear low-stress functioning. In plain terms: inferred perceived stress is near the population mean PSS (21.61), with certain indicators (notably trait anxiety and sleep/circadian irregularity) suggesting the participant may experience somewhat greater perceived stress than peers on some days, while other markers point to resilience that likely prevents a large elevation above the sample average."
72885,"Summary and overall inference
Based on the combined self-report and wearable-derived data, the balance of evidence suggests this participant is likely experiencing perceived stress somewhat above the study population mean (population PSS mean = 21.62). Several converging indicators — notably disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98), a chronically elevated trait-anxiety score (STAI Trait = 46, Z = 0.46), late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:44 AM) and reduced circadian regularity (low interdaily stability, Z = -1.32) — point toward elevated stress burden and circadian disruption. These signals are not uniformly large, and some protective features are present (see below), but overall the profile is more consistent with perceived stress above the sample mean rather than near or below it.

Evidence suggesting relatively higher perceived stress
- Sleep disturbance and short sleep duration: The participant reports poor sleep quality (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98), which is one of the stronger deviations from the sample and is a well-established correlate of higher perceived stress. Wearable-derived median nightly sleep of about 5 hours 59 minutes (Z = -1.5) indicates substantially shorter sleep than the sample average, and a late median sleep onset (~03:44) implies consistent circadian misalignment—both of which are associated with greater stress and poorer coping capacity.  
- Anxiety proneness and low self-esteem: Trait anxiety (STAI Trait = 46, Z = 0.46) is elevated relative to the sample and has a moderate positive correlation with PSS within the study. Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg score = 31, Z = -1.01) also aligns with vulnerability to higher perceived stress (the study-level correlation for self-esteem is negative). Together these trait-level indicators support a higher perceived stress interpretation.  
- Behavioral and social risk factors: Low frequency of exercise (especially exercising with others = ""Not at all"", Z = -1.58), reduced socializing (social time Z = -0.62), and recreational drug use (reported 1–2 times/week; very high Z-scores in the dataset) are behavioral patterns that can accompany or exacerbate stress. Although the dataset’s correlations show these particular substance-use measures have only small direct correlations with PSS, their combination with poor sleep and anxiety increases the plausibility of elevated perceived stress.  
- Circadian irregularity and blunted rhythm amplitude: Cosinor-derived features show reduced amplitude (Z = -1.0) and low interdaily stability (Z = -1.32), indicating a blunted and less consistent heart-rate rhythm. These circadian features have small-to-moderate associations with PSS in the study and, together with late sleep timing, suggest physiological dysregulation consistent with greater perceived stress.

Evidence suggesting relatively lower perceived stress (protective factors)
- Absence of a major depressive signal: The CES-D score (15, Z = 0.18) is near the population mean and is classified here as not depressed, which reduces the likelihood that depressive symptom burden is the primary driver of perceived distress. This tends to moderate the overall stress interpretation.  
- Some positive subjective affect and modest physical indicators: Self-reported current happiness (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55) is above average and may buffer stress perception. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.4 bpm, Z = -0.45), which can reflect cardiovascular fitness or greater parasympathetic tone and may be protective against subjective stress responses. Health satisfaction is not especially low (score 3.56) and alcohol consumption is modest. These features argue against extremely high perceived stress levels.  
- Limited consistency in some physiological correlates: Many wearable–PSS correlations in this sample are small in magnitude; for example, the participant’s overall MESOR is lower but only modestly correlated with PSS (correlation ~0.06). Several heart-rate hourly deviations and substance-use measures show only weak associations with PSS in the study dataset, which reduces confidence that they alone account for high stress.

Physiological and temporal pattern interpretation
- Heart-rate circadian pattern: The acrophase (peak cardiac activity) occurs in the early evening (~6:38 PM), and the afternoon/early-evening hours show the largest positive deviations from the mesor—typical daytime activity peaks. More clinically notable is the combination of an elevated HR deviation at 1–2 AM (large positive deviation, Z ≈ 2.04) alongside a late median sleep onset; this pattern can reflect nocturnal physiological arousal or a tendency to be awake/active at night, both of which are consistent with sleep disruption and elevated stress.  
- Regularity metrics: Low interdaily stability (Z = -1.32) and reduced amplitude (Z = -1.0) indicate a less robust 24-hour heart-rate rhythm, consistent with irregular sleep/wake scheduling and potentially with stress-related behavior (late nights, variable sleep start times). Intradaily variability is not markedly elevated, suggesting the participant’s within-day fragmentation is not extreme, but the low day-to-day stability remains salient.

Holistic conclusion
Taken together, the strongest indicators (marked subjective sleep disturbance, short and late sleep, elevated trait anxiety, reduced circadian stability and amplitude, and behavioral risk patterns) point toward perceived stress that is likely above the study population mean. Countervailing evidence (near-mean depressive symptoms, some positive self-reported happiness, and relatively low resting HR) temper the degree of elevation; they make very high PSS less certain but do not outweigh the multiple sleep–anxiety–circadian signals. Therefore, the most defensible summary is that this participant’s perceived stress is above the population mean PSS (greater than 21.62) by a small-to-moderate margin rather than near or below the mean.

Caveats
These inferences synthesize cross-sectional survey scores and aggregated wearable metrics and rely on sample-level correlations that are generally modest. They do not substitute for a direct PSS score or clinical assessment. If monitoring or intervention is of interest, prioritizing sleep timing/quality, daytime regularity (consistent sleep/wake), anxiety management strategies, and assessment of substance use could be reasonable next steps given the pattern observed."
71193,"Elevated internalizing symptoms and low positive affect constitute the strongest signals in this profile that align with increased perceived stress. The participant reports very high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 39; z = 2.67) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI-T = 60; z = 1.85); both of these scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), indicating that these symptom levels are meaningfully associated with higher perceived stress. In addition, self-esteem is low (RSES = 28; z = -1.43) and momentary happiness is substantially below the sample mean (happy z = -1.61); both of these variables have modest negative correlations with PSS in the study (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15, happiness r ≈ -0.19), again pointing toward greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep disturbance is also reported (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep), which commonly accompanies and amplifies perceived stress even when objective sleep duration is adequate.

There are several behavioral features that would typically support lower perceived stress, and these are present in the wearable and activity data. Objectively measured nocturnal sleep duration is longer than the study mean (median 8 h 2 min; z = 1.05) and sleep timing is consistent across nights (sleep-start SD ≈ 41 minutes; z ≈ -0.93), suggesting stable sleep timing and sufficient opportunity for sleep. Circadian organization of heart rate is relatively strong: interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are well above the sample mean (interdaily stability z = 1.57; autocorrelation24 z = 1.82) and intradaily variability is relatively low (z = -1.24). Larger amplitude of the circadian HR rhythm (amplitude z = 0.96) and a resting heart rate near the cohort mean (59 bpm; z = 0.1) likewise reflect preserved circadian structure and baseline cardiovascular state, features that in this sample are modestly associated with lower PSS (e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.17, interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12). These objective rhythms and stable sleep timing can be protective against perceived stress.

Behavioral patterns yield a mixed picture. The participant reports very little alcohol or recreational drug use and limited group exercise; they engage in video gaming and other sedentary hobbies more than average (video games z = 2.47; sedentary hobby z = 1.41). Low socializing with friends and infrequent exercise remove two common social and behavioral buffers against stress, which could contribute to higher perceived stress. At the same time, objective daytime physiologic signatures show clear daytime elevations in heart rate (notably mid-afternoon peaks ~2–4 pm with high deviations from mesor), consistent with periods of daily activity and engagement; in this dataset higher daytime amplitude/peaks are generally associated with lower PSS, which suggests that the participant has periods of daytime activation that may be adaptive or reflect routine activity.

There is an important subjective–objective discrepancy in sleep and perceived functioning. Although wearable sleep duration is relatively long and nightly timing is regular, the participant reports disturbed sleep on the PSQI and elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms. This pattern—adequate objective duration and regular timing but poor subjective sleep quality—can indicate sleep fragmentation not fully captured by duration metrics, nonrestorative sleep, or sleep-related cognitive/emotional distress; all of these are commonly tied to elevated perceived stress. Additionally, low self-rated health satisfaction and low trust scores (both below the sample mean) add to psychosocial strain even when some physiologic indices look stable.

Holistic interpretation: taken together, the strongest and most consistent signals point toward higher perceived stress for this participant. High depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety, low positive affect and self-esteem, disturbed subjective sleep, and limited social/exercise engagement are robust indicators associated with elevated PSS in this sample. Objective wearable metrics (stable circadian rhythms, sufficient sleep duration, normal resting heart rate) represent partial protective factors but do not outweigh the psychological symptom burden. Relative to the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), the overall pattern of measures is most consistent with perceived stress above the population mean."
98760,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, z = 1.05; classified as disturbed sleep), which is commonly associated with greater perceived stress. This participant also has a late median sleep-start time (≈ 01:58 AM) and a modestly elevated sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 102 minutes), which together may reflect behavioral sleep timing that can exacerbate perceived stress or daytime dysregulation. 
- Non-parametric circadian fragmentation is relatively elevated (intradaily variability = 0.67, z = 0.88), a metric that, in this sample, correlates positively with PSS; higher fragmentation suggests more frequent transitions between rest and activity and is often linked to higher perceived stress or poorer regulation. 
- Some wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated evening heart-rate departures from mesor (notably large positive deviations in the 6–9 PM window; z-scores up to ≈ 2.9 at 8–9 PM). Elevated evening physiological arousal can reflect evening activity or incomplete downregulation before sleep and may contribute to sleep complaints and higher perceived stress in some individuals.
- Behavioral social engagement is low relative to the study population (short daily socializing time, z ≈ -1.41). Reduced social interaction can be a psychosocial vulnerability that, depending on context, is associated with higher perceptions of stress for some people.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Symptom measures of mood and trait anxiety are low (CES-D = 7, z = -0.66; STAI–Trait = 33, z = -0.82), which is a robust signal that the participant does not report elevated depressive or chronic anxiety symptoms—factors that typically co-occur with higher perceived stress. 
- Self-esteem and current happiness are comparatively high (Rosenberg self-esteem z ≈ 0.82; current happiness z ≈ 1.64), both of which are protective characteristics that are associated in this sample with lower PSS or better psychological resilience.
- Health and lifestyle factors that tend to buffer stress are present: low resting heart rate (53 bpm, z ≈ -0.61), regular exercise frequency (exercising alone three times a week or more, z ≈ 1.07), minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use reported, negative z-scores), and an objectively pronounced circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ 1.64). In this dataset, greater amplitude and greater day-to-day stability/autocorrelation (interdaily stability z ≈ 0.5; autocorrelation at 24h z ≈ 0.64) are associated with lower PSS and indicate a relatively robust day–night physiological rhythm.
- Objective nocturnal heart-rate pattern shows a clear nightly decline (substantial negative deviations from mesor during the early-morning hours; large negative values ~ -20 to -26 bpm and negative z-scores in the 3:00–8:00 AM window), which is consistent with physiologic sleep-related downregulation. This intact nocturnal dip is generally a favorable sign of typical autonomic recovery overnight.

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement:
Taken together, the profile shows a mixture of protective psychological traits and healthy physiological markers alongside notable sleep complaints and some markers of circadian/behavioral fragmentation. The strongest protective signals are low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, higher self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate, and a strong circadian amplitude—all features that, in this sample, are associated with lower perceived stress. Conversely, the most salient risk signals for elevated perceived stress are the participant’s self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI), late sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability, and limited socializing, which could increase subjective stress or reduce buffering resources over time.

On balance, weighting the relatively strong protective psychological and physiological signals against the single prominent subjective sleep disturbance and circadian fragmentation, the overall pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level close to the study population mean or modestly below it. In comparative terms, the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best characterized as near to slightly below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62), rather than clearly above it. 

Caveats:
- This inference is probabilistic and rests on cross-sectional associations and aggregated wearable metrics rather than a directly reported PSS score. Correlations reported in the dataset are modest and do not imply causation. 
- The combination of objective signs of physiological robustness (e.g., low resting heart rate, high amplitude) with subjective sleep disturbance suggests a potential target for intervention or monitoring—improving sleep timing/quality and increasing social or restorative activities could further reduce perceived stress if desired."
95374,"Summary of higher perceived-stress indicators
Multiple self-report measures and behavioral markers point toward a relatively elevated level of perceived stress for this participant. Depressive symptom burden is elevated (CES-D = 28, z = +1.53), and trait anxiety is above average (STAI = 47, z = +0.56); both scales show positive correlations with PSS in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.31), indicating these elevations are likely to coincide with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is also poor (PSQI = 9, z = +1.05), and objective sleep is characterized by a very large night-to-night variability in duration (sleep duration SD = 219 minutes, z = +2.68) and a highly variable/late sleep onset (median sleep start ≈ 03:11 AM with start-time SD z = +1.43). These sleep disturbances and irregular timing have modest positive correlations with PSS (sleep variability and start-time variability r ≈ +0.15–0.18) and are commonly associated with higher stress. Self-reported current happiness is low (current happy = 2.0, z = −1.61), which also correlates negatively with PSS in the sample (i.e., low happiness associates with higher perceived stress). Taken together, affective symptoms, disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, and elevated sleep variability form a coherent cluster of signals that support a conclusion of greater-than-average perceived stress.

Summary of lower perceived-stress indicators
Several physiological and behavioral signals are more typically associated with lower stress or resilience. The participant’s wearable-derived resting heart rate is relatively low (RHR = 51.4 bpm, z = −0.80), which is often seen with better cardiovascular fitness and—within this sample—does not strongly indicate higher PSS (RHR correlation with PSS ≈ +0.14, small effect). Circadian structure indices are mixed but include protective features: a relatively high amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm (amplitude z = +2.06) and above-average 24-hour autocorrelation (z = +1.06) and modestly positive interdaily stability (z = +0.42). These circadian metrics correlate negatively with PSS in the sample (amplitude r ≈ −0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ −0.17), suggesting that strong, regular circadian organization is a potential buffer against perceived stress. Behaviorally, the participant reports little or no substance use, substantial evening socializing (3–4 hours, z = +1.74), and a median nightly sleep duration that is near the sample average (≈7 h 15 min, z ≈ +0.09). Self-esteem (RSES z ≈ +0.96) is relatively high and shows a modest negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), which also suggests some protective psychological resources.

Physiological time-of-day patterning and its implications
Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced evening and late-night elevations relative to the participant’s mesor (notably large positive deviations from ~7–12 PM and a marked positive spike at 12–1 AM; many of these hourly values have high positive z-scores). These elevations imply greater physiological arousal across evening hours and into late night; evening heart-rate elevation could reflect evening activity patterns, social engagement, or delayed circadian phase and may contribute to late sleep onset. By contrast, early-morning hourly deviations are strongly negative (large negative deviations across ~5–9 AM), consistent with consolidated sleep during those hours on days when the participant does sleep. The cosinor acrophase at ~7:41 PM and the high amplitude indicate the heart-rate rhythm is robust but shifted later into the evening, which aligns with the late median sleep start and suggests a delayed daily schedule that may increase conflict with daytime demands and thereby amplify perceived stress.

Integration and balanced interpretation
Evidence for elevated perceived stress is substantial and comes from affective symptom measures (elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety), poor subjective sleep quality, low reported happiness, and objective markers of highly irregular and late sleep timing—each of which is positively associated with PSS in the study sample. Counterbalancing this are physiological and lifestyle signals that tend to reduce stress risk: low resting heart rate, a pronounced and regular heart-rate circadian amplitude and autocorrelation, near-average median total sleep time, limited substance use, and relatively higher self-esteem and social time. The wearable circadian indicators suggest intact physiological regularity, but the timing of that rhythm is shifted later and accompanied by high night-to-night variability in sleep duration—this combination plausibly produces internal tension (regular rhythm but misaligned with conventional daytime demands), which can coexist with the protective features and still yield elevated perceived stress.

Overall conclusion relative to the study population mean
Weighing the evidence, the balance of indicators supports an inference that this participant’s overall perceived stress is above the study sample mean. Multiple self-report measures that correlate with PSS (CES-D, STAI, PSQI, low happiness) and objective markers of late and variable sleep provide convergent evidence pointing toward above-mean perceived stress. Therefore, relative to the study population mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), this participant’s pattern of data is most consistent with perceived stress that is above the population mean."
71985,"Summary and overall comparison to the study sample:
Taking the available self-report and wearable-derived indicators together, the participant’s profile contains a mix of signals but leans toward somewhat lower perceived stress than the study sample mean. Using the study population PSS mean of 21.61 as a reference point, the pattern of physiological and behavioral markers (particularly strong circadian regularity, a low resting heart rate, and generally adequate sleep duration) is most consistent with an inferred PSS that is near to slightly below the population mean rather than well above it. This inference is probabilistic and should be interpreted in the context of uncertainty from mixed psychosocial indicators (see below).

Features consistent with relatively greater perceived stress:
- Trait anxiety and subclinical mood symptom burden: The participant reports a STAI–Trait score of 41 (near the sample mean) and a CES-D score of 14 (classified “not depressed” but nonzero symptoms). Both STAI and CES-D have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28 respectively). The participant’s scores therefore provide modest evidence for stress vulnerability or a tendency to experience anxiety-related symptoms, which aligns with higher perceived stress risk.
- Lower self-evaluations of physical health and self-esteem: Health satisfaction is relatively low (z ≈ -1.2), and self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES z ≈ -0.59). Lower health satisfaction and lower self-esteem are psychosocial factors that tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress (self-esteem correlates with PSS in the sample at r ≈ -0.15).
- Variability in sleep timing and some intra-individual variability: Sleep start time variability and sleep-duration standard deviation are slightly above the sample mean (z ≈ 0.35 and 0.17). In the sample, greater sleep variability shows small positive correlations with PSS (e.g., sleep variability r ≈ 0.14), so the participant’s modest sleep timing variability provides a small contribution toward higher perceived stress risk.
- Behavioral pattern signals: High reported time spent playing video games (z ≈ 2.47) and elevated solitary screen time could reflect coping or avoidance patterns. While these behaviors are not direct measures of stress, they appear in the participant’s profile alongside anxiety-related scores and lower health satisfaction.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Strong circadian regularity and rhythm robustness: Wearable-derived circadian metrics are notably supportive of regularity—interdaily stability is high (value 0.66, z ≈ 2.07), autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (z ≈ 1.74), and amplitude is above average (z ≈ 1.01). In the study sample these measures correlate negatively with PSS (e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17; amplitude r ≈ -0.17), so the participant’s strong rhythm measures point toward lower perceived stress.
- Resting physiology consistent with lower tonic arousal: Resting heart rate is low (50 bpm, z ≈ -0.97) and the hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (nighttime deviations down to ~-24 bpm from the mesor). Lower resting HR and clear nocturnal parasympathetic-dominant periods are typically associated with lower baseline physiological arousal and, in this sample, are weakly associated with lower PSS (resting HR correlates modestly with PSS at r ≈ 0.14 but here the participant is well below the mean).
- Sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality: Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 18 min (z ≈ 0.14), and PSQI score is 5 (z ≈ -0.8, classified “Good Sleep”). Adequate objective sleep duration and relatively good subjective sleep quality are features commonly associated with lower perceived stress and better daytime functioning.
- Regular activity peaks and acrophase within expected range: The heart-rate acrophase (≈4:37 PM) and daytime elevations (notably mid-day and late-afternoon peaks) indicate predictable, consolidated daytime activity rather than irregular fragmentation. Intradaily variability is near the sample mean (z ≈ 0.03), suggesting the participant does not show markedly fragmented activity rhythms that are often associated with higher stress.

Integrated interpretation and conclusion:
Overall, psychosocial self-report items produce some cautionary signals (trait anxiety, modest depressive symptoms, lower health satisfaction, and lower self-esteem) that are associated in the sample with higher perceived stress. However, the wearable-derived physiology and behavioral-regularity indicators are comparatively strong and point toward lower chronic physiological arousal and a well-entrained daily schedule—features that are, in the study data, associated with lower PSS. Balancing these multimodal signals, the net pattern is most consistent with perceived stress that is at or slightly below the sample mean (i.e., modestly lower than a PSS = 21.61), rather than substantially elevated.

Caveats and suggestions:
This inference is probabilistic and integrates correlational patterns rather than providing a direct PSS score. The psychosocial indicators that trend toward higher perceived stress (trait anxiety, lower self-esteem, and low health satisfaction) warrant monitoring or targeted assessment, particularly because physiological markers can be resilient even when subjective distress is present. If the study’s goal is precise classification of PSS for this participant, obtaining the participant’s self-reported PSS score or repeated ecological momentary measures of stress would reduce uncertainty and allow direct validation of these inferences."
43125,"Summary of self-report and trait measures: The participant’s self-report profile contains multiple markers that commonly co-occur with elevated perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden is markedly high (CES-D = 37, Z = +2.47) and trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 53, Z = +1.16). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = +1.52) despite a report of adequate sleep duration. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are below the study mean (RSES Z ≈ −0.73; happiness Z ≈ −0.53), and health satisfaction is lower than average. Behavioral risk factors that align with higher stress include frequent beer consumption (≈ three times/week, Z = +1.72) and relatively frequent recreational drug use (1–2 times/week, Z = +5.44). Social and physical-activity engagement is low (no reported exercise, low socializing), which further aligns with the elevated mood and anxiety symptoms.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian data: Objective sleep duration is within a typical range (median 7 h 28 min, Z = +0.35) and night-to-night variability in duration and start time is relatively low (sleep duration SD Z ≈ −0.66; sleep start SD Z ≈ −0.82). However, the participant’s median sleep onset is late (around 02:00), and subjective sleep quality is nonetheless poor, suggesting a mismatch between duration and perceived restorative sleep. Circadian heart-rate features show a pronounced amplitude (Z ≈ +1.36) with an acrophase in the early evening (≈ 6:29 PM) and modest interdaily stability (Z ≈ +0.25). Resting heart rate is on the lower side (54.8 bpm, Z ≈ −0.40). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations indicate relatively elevated heart rate late at night (notably 12–1 AM, Z ≈ +1.67) and elevated evening/late-night deviations (multiple evening hours Z > +1), with large overnight dips in the early morning—consistent with a physiologic profile of evening arousal followed by robust nocturnal reduction.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher perceived stress: The strongest signals indicating elevated perceived stress come from self-report affective measures: very high depressive symptoms (CES-D) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI), both of which correlate positively with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32). Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI Z ≈ +1.52) also typically tracks with higher perceived stress. Behavioral correlates (frequent alcohol use, high recreational drug use, lack of exercise, limited social engagement, and lower self-esteem/happiness) further support an elevated-stress interpretation. Physiological indicators that are concordant with stress include evening increases in heart rate and modest positive correlations between some circadian disruption measures (e.g., intradaily variability, sleep start variability) and higher PSS in the sample; the participant shows small positive associations in those metrics with PSS (intradaily variability r ≈ +0.16; sleep start time SD r ≈ +0.17).

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress or potential resilience: Several objective markers temper a strong inference of extreme physiological stress. The participant has a relatively low resting heart rate (Z ≈ −0.40), which can reflect better cardiovascular fitness and is not typical of sustained high sympathetic tone. Sleep duration is objectively sufficient and night-to-night variability is low, and interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are modestly positive—reflecting a reasonably stable daily structure. The relatively low intradaily variability (Z ≈ −0.39) indicates less fragmentation of activity across days, which is generally associated with better circadian organization. These wearable-derived regularities and adequate sleep quantity are features that, all else equal, would be more consistent with lower physiological stress or some preserved behavioral regularity.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study sample mean PSS: Integrating self-report and wearable evidence yields a mixed but interpretable picture. The subjective and behavioral data (especially very elevated depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, poor subjective sleep, substance use, and low social/exercise engagement) provide a robust signal that the participant’s perceived stress is likely above the study population mean. Objective wearable metrics provide partial counterpoints—adequate and consistent sleep duration, low resting heart rate, and reasonable circadian stability—but they do not outweigh the strong psychosocial signals. Given the magnitude of the self-report elevations (CES-D Z > +2, PSQI and STAI > +1) and their established associations with PSS, the most defensible conclusion is that this participant’s overall perceived stress level is above the population mean (study mean PSS = 21.62). This inference is probabilistic and should be treated as provisional; the wearable physiology suggests some preserved behavioral regularity and physical conditioning that may moderate but does not eliminate the elevated subjective stress signal."
98117,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows multiple converging signals associated with elevated perceived stress, alongside a smaller set of features that could mitigate or complicate that interpretation. Self-report measures indicate notably elevated depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 33; Z = +2.05) and trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z = +1.16), both of which are positively correlated with PSS in the study sample (CES-D correlation 0.28; STAI correlation 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is also disturbed (PSQI = 8, above the usual clinical cutoff), and self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are below the sample mean (happiness Z = −1.61; health satisfaction Z = −0.95). Taken together, these survey measures provide strong and consistent psychological evidence that aligns with higher perceived stress.

Features that point toward higher perceived stress: several behavioral and wearable indicators compound the psychological signal. The participant has a very late and highly irregular sleep schedule (median sleep start 04:03, sleep start SD = 280 minutes, Z = +4.33) and highly variable total sleep duration (SD = 234 minutes, Z = +3.02). Both forms of sleep irregularity have modest positive correlations with PSS in the dataset and are known, in aggregate, to be associated with greater perceived stress and poorer mood. Low daytime social engagement (socializing 15 minutes or less; Z = −2.20), high recreational internet use (more than 4 hours; Z = +2.19), and minimal exercise are additional behavioral factors that typically co-occur with elevated stress and poorer psychological functioning. The combination of elevated depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, high sleep timing variability, low social contact and low physical activity constitutes a strong cluster of signals consistent with above-mean perceived stress.

Features that point toward lower perceived stress or complicate the picture: a few wearable-derived circadian metrics are either neutral or move opposite to the high-stress indicators. Intradaily variability is relatively low (value 0.3, Z = −1.73), which indicates less fragmentation of activity across the day; lower fragmentation in this metric in the sample is not strongly associated with higher PSS (correlation = +0.16) and could be interpreted as an element of preserved daily structure. Interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.4, Z = −0.08), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is near average (Z = +0.06), suggesting the participant retains some day-to-day regularity in circadian patterning. The participant also reports no substance use (beer, wine/liquor, recreational/non-prescribed drugs all “not at all”), which is a protective behavioral factor that tends to be associated with lower risk for stress-related complications in the sample. These elements moderate the interpretation but are smaller in magnitude than the elevated psychological symptom signals.

Physiological circadian and heart-rate profile interpretation: wearable heart-rate metrics show a modestly elevated resting heart rate (66.4 bpm, Z = +0.98) and a mesor that is above the sample mean (mesor 80.99, Z = +0.96), which are physiologically consistent with higher sympathetic tone or lower fitness and have a small positive correlation with perceived stress in the sample. Amplitude of the circadian heart-rate rhythm is slightly reduced (amplitude 9.49, Z = −0.42); lower amplitude correlates with higher PSS in the study (corr ≈ −0.17 because higher amplitude relates to lower PSS), so this pattern is compatible with elevated perceived stress. Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show the expected overnight troughs and evening peaks; the participant’s evening heart-rate elevation (peak deviations in late afternoon/early evening) and only modest daytime elevations could reflect atypical activity timing and late sleep/wake behavior rather than a clearly adaptive diurnal rhythm.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSS: weighing the evidence, the balance favors an inference that this participant’s perceived stress level is above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61). The strongest and most salient contributors to that inference are the markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D), elevated trait anxiety (STAI), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), and very large irregularity in sleep timing and duration — all of which have established associations with greater perceived stress and which are large deviations from the sample mean (multiple Z-scores > +2 or near that threshold). Protective signals (no substance use, lower intradaily variability, some day-to-day circadian stability) are present but smaller in magnitude and do not counterbalance the robust self-report symptom cluster.

Caveats and interpretation limits: these inferences are probabilistic and correlational. Correlations between individual wearables and PSS in the sample are generally modest, and causality cannot be inferred from cross-sectional associations. The participant’s profile suggests elevated perceived stress relative to peers in this sample, but an exact PSS score cannot be determined from the available data. If the goal is intervention planning, the most salient targets based on these data would be sleep timing regularity, subjective sleep quality, social engagement, and mood/anxiety symptoms."
24883,"Overview: The participant’s data present a mixed profile of behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived physiological indicators relevant to perceived stress. Key objective markers include a late habitual sleep onset (median sleep start time 03:00), moderately short nightly sleep (median 6 h 53 m; Z = -0.38), a PSQI score of 6 (classified as disturbed sleep), and altered circadian heart-rate structure (reduced amplitude and interdaily stability). Self-report measures show relatively low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 9; Z = -0.45) alongside a modestly elevated trait-anxiety score (STAI = 42; Z = 0.07) and comparatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.52). Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.2 bpm; Z = -0.71). Taken together, these multimodal features suggest both risk factors and protective factors with respect to perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several signals point toward processes often associated with increased stress. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and a very late habitual sleep onset (3:00 AM) indicate disrupted sleep timing and poorer sleep quality, both of which are commonly linked to elevated perceived stress. Wearable heart-rate patterns show pronounced evening and late-night elevations relative to the participant’s mesor (notably large positive deviations around midnight and early AM; 12–2 AM deviations Z = 1.95–2.82) and reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -1.11) and interdaily stability (Z = -0.99), a pattern consistent with blunted day–night physiological separation and circadian irregularity that has been associated with higher stress and poorer recovery. Trait anxiety (STAI) correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31) and the participant’s STAI is at or slightly above the sample mean (Z = 0.07), supporting a possible contribution of anxiety-proneness to perceived stress. Behavioral factors that can increase stress exposure or reduce buffering—low frequency of exercise (exercised alone 1–2 times/month; Z = -0.43), minimal socializing (social time Z = -1.41), and low reported health satisfaction (Z = -0.70)—also incline the profile toward greater perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: The participant also shows several signals that tend to be protective or incompatible with a very high PSS. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 9; Z = -0.45), and academic performance is strong (GPAs near 3.9–4.0), which may reflect functional coping and competence in the academic domain. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.2 bpm; Z = -0.71), a marker often associated with cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic physiological arousal. Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES Z = 1.52), which is typically associated with lower perceived stress (sample correlation r ≈ -0.16). Substance and drug use are minimal beyond occasional alcohol (beer/wine 1–2×/week), which reduces one common source of stress-related dysregulation. Some circadian metrics (autocorrelation at 24 h near the sample mean, Z = 0.06; intradaily variability actually lower than average, Z = -1.31) could reflect fewer rapid within-day transitions in activity/heart rate, which may be protective against momentary arousal spikes.

Physiological timing and associations with perceived stress: The participant’s circadian heart-rate profile is shifted and damped: an acrophase in the evening (≈7:01 PM), low amplitude, and relatively unstable day-to-day timing (interdaily stability Z = -0.99). The hourly aggregated deviations reveal elevated heart rate in the late evening and around midnight (Zs up to ~2.8) with pronounced negative deviations during typical morning hours; several of the early-morning hourly deviations (3–6 AM) show modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.19–0.21), suggesting that altered nocturnal/early-morning cardiovascular patterns in this participant are linked in the cohort to higher perceived stress. These timing features align with the self-reported late sleep onset and PSQI disturbance and suggest the physiological substrate of arousal is shifted later into the night.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample PSS: Balancing the evidence, the participant’s profile contains meaningful indicators both for and against elevated perceived stress. The combination of disturbed sleep timing/quality, evening physiological arousal, some anxiety-proneness, limited socializing and exercise, and circadian dampening are factors that tend to increase perceived stress; conversely, low depressive symptoms, high self-reported self-esteem, low resting heart rate, and strong academic functioning are protective. Considering the magnitude of these signals and their established associations with perceived stress in the sample (e.g., STAI and CES-D correlations with PSS ≈ 0.28–0.31; certain nocturnal HR features correlating ≈ 0.19–0.21), the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s perceived stress level is near the study population mean, with a reasonable possibility of being modestly above the mean. In other words: near the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61), leaning slightly toward above-average perceived stress given the nocturnal arousal and sleep disturbance indicators.

Caveats: This assessment integrates cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable summaries and does not substitute for a direct measured PSS score or clinical evaluation. Correlations reported here are sample-level associations and do not prove causation for this individual. If a primary concern is elevated perceived stress or sleep-disruption, targeted assessment focused on sleep timing/intervention, anxiety symptoms, and daytime activity/social support would help clarify risk and guide interventions."
66815,"Summary: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived measures yields a mixed but overall coherent picture in which physiological and behavioral markers predominantly point toward relatively low perceived stress, while a few trait and rhythm-related indicators suggest some vulnerability to stress. Objective cardiovascular and sleep metrics (low resting heart rate, a robust day–night heart rate amplitude, and stable sleep duration) and positive self-reports (higher-than-average happiness, good sleep quality, and no elevated depressive symptoms) are the strongest signals consistent with lower perceived stress. Counterbalancing these are modest elevations on a trait anxiety measure and several circadian fragmentation signals that have modest associations with higher PSS in the study sample. On balance, the constellation of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress is below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61), likely closer to or below the lower half of the distribution rather than above it.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: 
- Trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score of 41 (z ≈ -0.03) is near the sample mean but classified as “anxious” and the STAI shows a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31). This suggests a baseline disposition toward anxiety that could elevate perceived stress even if current mood is positive. 
- Some circadian fragmentation indicators: Intradaily variability (value 0.60, z = 0.39) is modestly elevated and correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), and the 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively low (0.23, z = -0.78; correlation with PSS ≈ -0.17), which can reflect weaker 24-hour regularity. These features point to some within-day irregularity or reduced day-to-day rhythmic repetition that in this sample is associated with higher perceived stress. 
- Behavioral leisure/social indices: Several self-reported daily recreation metrics are very low (e.g., little TV, video games, reading, or extended socializing; socializing reported only 16–30 minutes), which could reflect limited restorative leisure or social downtime; limited solitary exercise frequency (less than 1–2 times per month) could also reduce individual stress-coping opportunities. While some of these have small correlations with PSS in the dataset, their combination may contribute to vulnerability.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Sleep and sleep regularity: Median nightly sleep of ~7 h 6 min (z ≈ -0.11) with a relatively low night-to-night sleep duration standard deviation (40 minutes, z ≈ -1.38) and a PSQI score of 5 (z ≈ -0.8, classified here as “Good Sleep”) indicate adequate and consistent sleep—robust sleep duration and low variability are generally associated with lower perceived stress.
- Cardiovascular fitness and diurnal amplitude: Resting heart rate is notably low at 45.8 bpm (z ≈ -1.47), and cosinor amplitude of the heart rate rhythm is relatively high (amplitude = 15.84, z = 1.64). In this sample, greater amplitude correlates with lower PSS (r ≈ -0.17). A pronounced nocturnal dip (large negative deviations overnight relative to the mesor, e.g., −26 to −28 bpm during early morning hours) further supports good nighttime recovery. These physiological signs point to good cardiovascular fitness and intact sleep-related autonomic downregulation—both protective against perceived stress.
- Regular daily structure and active social exercise: Interdaily stability is above average (0.51, z = 0.83), consistent with a reasonably regular day-to-day schedule, which is associated with lower PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.12). The pronounced evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., 38 bpm above mesor around 5–6pm, z = 4.07) combined with self-reported frequent exercise with others (three times/week or more; z = 1.23) suggest regular evening physical and social activity that likely contributes to well-being rather than to stress—these episodes plausibly explain the evening HR peaks rather than indicating distress.
- Positive mood and low depressive symptoms: Current happiness is high (score 5, z = 1.64) and CES-D score is low (11, z = -0.24; classified as not depressed). Self-esteem is above average (z ≈ 0.54). These subjective measures have inverse or small correlations with PSS in the sample and collectively support lower perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study population mean: When weighting the relative magnitude and consistency of these indicators, the preponderance of both objective (low resting HR, robust amplitude, stable sleep) and subjective (higher happiness, low depressive symptoms, good sleep quality) signals favor a perceived stress level below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). The participant’s risk-elevating indicators—trait anxiety near the sample mean and modest circadian fragmentation—are real but smaller in magnitude and more equivocal than the protective signs. Thus the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s PSS is below the population mean (i.e., lower perceived stress than average in this sample), though not necessarily at a minimum: there are identifiable vulnerabilities (anxiety proneness and some within-day rhythm irregularity) that could increase stress in certain circumstances.

Uncertainty and caveats: This inference synthesizes cross-sectional survey scores and aggregated wearable metrics; the heart-rate measures are temporally aggregated and cannot identify acute stress episodes or day-specific events. Some circadian metrics show mixed signals (e.g., high interdaily stability but low 24-hour autocorrelation), underscoring heterogeneity in rhythm regularity that would benefit from epoch-level inspection. Finally, trait anxiety’s positive relationship with PSS suggests monitoring of stress reactivity over time even though current objective and subjective indicators are generally favorable."
89161,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the profile shows a mixture of protective psychological indicators and a few physiological/behavioral signals that can be interpreted as stress-related. Self-report scales (CES-D = 4, STAI-Trait = 31) and positive well-being indicators (high self-esteem, high momentary happiness, above-average health satisfaction) point toward relatively low symptom burden and adaptive functioning. Wearable-derived physiology (low resting heart rate, normative median sleep duration with low night-to-night variability) further supports comparatively low physiological arousal. In contrast, objective circadian fragmentation (elevated intradaily variability), some late-evening heart rate elevations, a late habitual sleep onset (~01:56), and conspicuous weekly recreational drug use are features that could reflect behavioral patterns or physiological states associated with higher perceived stress for some individuals. Balancing these sources, the overall pattern is more consistent with perceived stress below the study sample mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several wearable circadian metrics suggest less-regular daily structure, which in the literature and in the study correlations is linked to higher perceived stress. Intradaily variability is elevated (z ≈ 1.3; positive correlation with PSS ≈ 0.16), indicating more frequent transitions between activity/rest states across the day and potential circadian fragmentation. Autocorrelation at 24 hours and interdaily stability are slightly below the sample mean (small negative z-scores), suggesting reduced day-to-day regularity. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 01:56 AM), and while overall sleep duration is adequate, a pattern of late nights can be associated with evening physiological arousal or social/behavioral demands that may accompany higher perceived stress. Finally, recreational drug use reported at 1–2 times per week (z ≈ 5.44) is an outlying behavioral feature; even though its direct correlation with measured PSS in this sample is small, frequent recreational substance use is a plausible marker of coping behavior or lifestyle factors that can accompany stress for some people and therefore merits attention.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Self-report measures show consistently low affective symptom burden: CES-D and STAI-Trait scores are well below the study mean (z ≈ -0.97 and -1.02 respectively), and momentary happiness and health satisfaction are well above average (happiness z ≈ 1.64; health satisfaction z ≈ 1.38). Self-esteem is elevated (z ≈ 1.52), which is negatively correlated with PSS in this sample and is typically protective against perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5) and objective sleep metrics (median sleep ~7 h 26 min, low night-to-night SD) indicate generally adequate and relatively stable sleep duration. Resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than the sample mean (resting HR z ≈ -0.51; MESOR z ≈ -0.86), consistent with lower tonic cardiovascular arousal. Social and recreational engagement is high (more than 4 hours socializing; high listening-to-music), which often functions as social support or restorative behavior and can be associated with reduced perceived stress in many contexts.

Physiological and temporal patterning: Heart rate cosinor results show a modest circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -0.33) with an acrophase around early evening (≈5:38 PM), and hourly aggregated deviations indicate expected nocturnal troughs and daytime peaks. The pronounced negative deviations in the early morning hours and a relatively low mesor reflect low average cardiac activity overnight and lower overall cardiac tone. There are notable positive deviations in the late morning–early afternoon (12–1 PM peak) and an above-average late-evening deviation at 10–11 PM (z ≈ 1.65). While some of these late-evening heart rate elevations might suggest evening arousal, the correlations between specific hourly deviations and PSS are small and mixed in sign; therefore these hourly features should be interpreted as possible contributors rather than strong determinants of perceived stress in this individual.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample mean: Taking the totality of evidence into account—particularly the low self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms, elevated self-esteem and happiness, adequate and regular sleep duration, and low resting heart rate—the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is most consistent with being below the population mean PSS score (population mean = 21.62). This inference is tempered by circadian fragmentation (elevated intradaily variability), a late habitual sleep onset, and notable recreational drug use, which are potential risk or coping indicators that could increase perceived stress or vulnerability in specific contexts. Overall, the balance of psychological and physiological indicators favors lower-than-average perceived stress, but the circadian irregularity and behavioral risk behaviors warrant monitoring and, if clinically relevant, discussion.

Limitations: These inferences combine cross-sectional self-report snapshots with aggregated wearable summaries and do not replace direct assessment of perceived stress. Correlations provided in the dataset are modest in magnitude, and some behavioral features (e.g., high socializing, listening to music, or internet use) can have different implications depending on context. Interpretations about causality or clinical states are therefore limited; follow-up assessment focused on temporal dynamics of stress, coping strategies, and substance use context would clarify risk."
14847,"Summary of indicators consistent with higher perceived stress:
The self-report profile contains multiple signals that align with elevated perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 24, Z = 1.11) are both above the study mean and have positive correlations with PSS in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28), which increases the likelihood that perceived stress is elevated. Subjective sleep disturbance is also prominent (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52), and poor sleep quality commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress. Wearable-derived circadian metrics further reflect instability in daily physiology: intradaily variability is unusually high (0.83, Z = 2.01; PSS correlation ≈ 0.16) and interdaily stability is relatively low (0.35, Z = -0.49; correlation ≈ -0.12), indicating fragmented and irregular day‑to‑day rhythms—a pattern that has been associated with higher stress. The participant’s sleep timing is late and variable (median sleep start ~02:24, sleep start SD ≈ 104 minutes) with a shorter-than-average nocturnal sleep duration (median 6 h 38 min, Z = -0.69) and elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps 0.24, Z = 1.90). These objective and subjective sleep irregularities and the higher nap rate are consistent with the profile of increased perceived stress.

Summary of indicators consistent with lower perceived stress:
Several features point toward resilience or lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate and overall mesor are near the population mean (RHR = 58.4 bpm, Mesor ≈ 74.7, Z-scores ≈ 0), suggesting no evidence of chronically elevated cardiovascular tone at rest. The participant reports relatively frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more, Z = 1.07), which is generally associated with better stress regulation (exercise frequency here shows a small, non-significant correlation with PSS). Self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are above average (happiness Z ≈ 0.55; health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.97), which may buffer stress perceptions. Social activity reported (socializing 2–3 hours/day, Z ≈ 0.95) and engagement with music (2–3 hours/day, Z ≈ 1.13) are other potentially protective lifestyle factors. Additionally, amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is modestly lower than average (Amplitude Z ≈ -0.41), but the overall mesor and resting rate do not show the elevations that would indicate sustained physiological hyperarousal.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
Weighing the evidence, the balance of salient indicators supports an inference of perceived stress above the study population mean. The strongest contributors to this conclusion are the elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI and CES-D both well above mean and moderately correlated with PSS), marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10), and objective circadian/behavioral instability (high intradaily variability, low interdaily stability, late and variable sleep timing, and elevated nap frequency). Protective features—regular exercise frequency, positive health satisfaction, normal resting heart rate, and substantial social/leisure time—reduce the likelihood of extreme PSS elevations but do not fully offset the multiple converging indicators of stress. Therefore, relative to the study sample mean PSS (21.61), the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress is above the population mean.

Magnitude and uncertainty:
The available correlations between individual measures and PSS are modest, indicating that any quantitative prediction of the exact PSS score would be uncertain. However, the convergence of clinically elevated affective symptoms (CES-D, STAI) together with disturbed subjective sleep and objectively measurable circadian irregularity increases confidence that perceived stress is meaningfully higher than average, rather than only minimally different from the mean."
43382,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals. Self-report symptom measures (notably elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety) and sleep timing/quantity suggest greater perceived stress, while several objective behavioral and circadian metrics (relatively regular day-to-day rhythms, low intraday fragmentation, low substance use) and high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction point toward resilience or lower stress. On balance, the pattern is most consistent with a moderately elevated perceived stress level relative to the study sample (see final paragraph for comparison to the sample mean).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Mood and anxiety symptom burden: The CES-D score is 28 (Z = 1.53; classified “Depressed”), and the STAI–Trait is 46 (Z = 0.46; “anxious”). Both scales have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), so these elevated symptom scores are among the strongest indicators favoring higher perceived stress in this participant.
- Self-concept and vulnerability: Rosenberg self-esteem is below the sample mean (score = 32; Z = –0.87) and correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ –0.16). Lower self-esteem in this context supports greater perceived stress risk.
- Sleep quantity and timing: Wearable-derived median nightly sleep is short (6 hr 10 min; Z = –1.27), and the participant’s median sleep start is late (about 01:28). Short and late sleep are frequently associated with poorer stress recovery and may contribute to higher perceived stress even though the direct correlation with PSS in the study is small.
- Physiological baseline features modestly aligned with stress: Resting heart rate and MESOR are above the study mean (RHR = 63.4 bpm, MESOR = 83.2; Zs ≈ 0.6–1.3) and have small positive correlations with PSS, which is consistent with slightly higher tonic cardiovascular arousal.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Robust circadian organization: Circadian summary metrics indicate relatively stable daily structure — interdaily stability is above average (0.45; Z = 0.33) and intradaily variability is lower than the sample mean (0.44; Z = –0.74). Autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (Z = 0.73). In this sample these rhythm regularity metrics trend toward lower PSS (negative correlations), so preserved rhythmicity favors lower perceived stress.
- Low substance use and low daytime napping: Self-reported minimal alcohol and drug use and a low mean daily nap frequency (0.07) are behaviors that, in this study, do not align with elevated PSS and can be considered protective or neutral.
- Positive self-reported well-being and health satisfaction: Current happiness is relatively high (score = 5; Z = 1.64) and health satisfaction is above average (Z = 1.22). Both variables correlate negatively (though modestly) with PSS in the sample and support lower perceived stress.
- Low behavioral fragmentation on wearables: Hourly heart rate deviations show expected nocturnal decreases and daytime elevations with clear peaks, and measures of intraday variability are low—these patterns suggest orderly activity-rest separation rather than chaotic, stress-linked dysregulation.

Physiological and temporal detail (integration): Hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions (largest negative deviations around 3–5 AM) and midday/evening elevations (notable positive deviations around midday and late evening), consistent with a preserved circadian amplitude and acrophase near late afternoon (acrophase ≈ 4:54 PM). The participant’s amplitude is near the cohort mean, while MESOR is elevated; this combination suggests a somewhat higher baseline cardiovascular tone but intact daily modulation. Sleep timing is late and somewhat variable (sleep onset SD ≈ 101 minutes), which may interact with mood symptoms to maintain perceived stress despite otherwise stable rhythms.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSS: Considering the relatively strong indicators of psychological symptom burden (CES-D and STAI), together with short/late sleep and somewhat elevated resting cardiovascular tone, balanced against protective features (high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, low substance use, and robust circadian regularity), the preponderance of evidence points to perceived stress that is above the study sample mean (sample mean PSS = 21.62). The elevation appears to be moderate rather than extreme: mood symptom scores are the primary drivers of higher stress risk, while preserved daily regularity and positive self-reported well-being partially offset that risk."
75438,"Summary and overall inference
Based on the combination of self-report trait measures, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived physiology, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant’s perceived stress is likely below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68). Trait measures of mood and anxiety (CES‑D = 7, Z = −0.66; STAI‑Trait = 36, Z = −0.52) and self‑esteem (RSES = 33, Z = −0.73) are all lower than the sample average in directions typically associated with lower perceived stress. Objective cardiovascular markers (resting heart rate 53 bpm, Z = −0.61; mesor 69.5, Z = −0.61) and non‑parametric circadian features (low intradaily variability, Z = −1.09) further align with a physiological profile that, on average, corresponds to lower stress in this cohort. Taken together, these signals suggest perceived stress that is below the population mean rather than substantially above it.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Several stable trait and physiological indicators point toward lower perceived stress. The participant reports relatively few depressive symptoms and lower trait anxiety (both z < −0.5), and reports higher-than-average self‑esteem (z ≈ −0.73), each of which are commonly associated with lower PSS scores in this sample. Regular physical activity (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07) and reasonable social engagement (socializing 2–3 hours, Z = 0.95) are behavioral supports for stress resilience. Wearable physiology is concordant: a comparatively low resting heart rate and a mesor below the sample mean (both Z ≈ −0.6) typically indicate lower baseline autonomic arousal. Low intradaily variability (Z = −1.09) reflects fewer large within‑day shifts in activity/heart rate and, given the small positive correlation between intradaily variability and PSS in this dataset, is more consistent with lower perceived stress.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Counterbalancing those protective signals, several sleep and circadian behavioral markers point toward stress‑related risk. The participant’s PSQI score is 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”), and wearable sleep shows a short median nightly sleep duration of ~6 hours 2 minutes (Z = −1.43) with a late median sleep onset (~1:43 AM). Short sleep, late bedtimes, and subjective sleep disturbance are commonly associated with higher perceived stress and poorer daytime functioning. Interdaily stability of the heart‑rate rhythm is reduced (value 0.33, Z = −0.66), which—though the correlation with PSS is modest—can reflect less consistent day‑to‑day scheduling and has been linked to greater stress in some samples. The participant also reports somewhat lower momentary happiness (current = 3.0, Z = −0.53), which in this sample shows a modest inverse relation to stress. It is notable that many of the correlations between these specific wearable metrics and PSS are small in magnitude in the study dataset, so these associations should be interpreted cautiously.

Integrated interpretation and caveats
When weighing the evidence, the stronger and more consistent indicators (low depressive and trait anxiety scores, higher self‑esteem, regular exercise, low resting heart rate, and low intradaily variability) collectively favor an inference of perceived stress below the study mean. The primary sources of potential elevation in stress are sleep‑related (disturbed subjective sleep, short objective sleep duration, and late sleep timing) and reduced interdaily rhythm stability; these suggest specific behavioral targets for improvement but do not, in this set of measures, outweigh the broader pattern of lower‑stress signals. Therefore the most defensible summary is that this participant’s perceived stress is likely below the population mean PSS (i.e., lower than average in this sample), though sleep behaviors represent a notable risk factor that could increase perceived stress if they persist or worsen.

Limitations and recommendations
This inference is probabilistic and constrained by the available measures: correlations between many wearable features and PSS are small in this sample, the dataset provides aggregated hourly physiology rather than day‑specific context, and no direct PSS score for the individual was provided. Practical next steps would be to monitor and target sleep timing and duration (e.g., earlier consistent bedtime, sleep hygiene interventions) and to reassess perceived stress directly (PSS) alongside sleep improvement efforts. Tracking day‑to‑day schedule regularity would also help clarify whether reduced interdaily stability is behavioral (scheduling variability) or situational."
99733,"Summary/holistic impression:
Across modalities the profile is mixed. Self-report trait and symptom measures (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, above-average self-esteem, good subjective sleep quality, and relatively high health satisfaction) point toward relatively low perceived stress. In contrast, wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics (notably elevated intradaily variability, modestly elevated resting heart rate, reduced circadian amplitude, and reduced 24-hour regularity) point toward physiological signatures that are, on average, associated with greater perceived stress. Integrating these signals, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is near the study sample mean (21.62), with physiological markers suggesting a modest upward deviation from the subjective-report profile rather than a clear, large departure from population average.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Circadian/heart-rate structure: Intradaily variability is relatively high (value 0.70; Z = +1.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (value 0.26; Z = −0.53). High intradaily fragmentation and low day-to-day rhythm stability are commonly associated with elevated perceived stress (here intradaily variability correlation with PSS ≈ +0.16; autocorrelation correlation ≈ −0.17).  
- Circadian amplitude and mesor: Circadian amplitude is lower than the study mean (amplitude Z = −0.43), and mesor/resting HR are modestly elevated (resting HR = 62.6, Z = +0.53). Lower amplitude and higher resting heart rate have small positive associations with PSS in this sample (amplitude correlation −0.17 implies lower amplitude co-occurs with higher PSS; resting HR correlation ≈ +0.14). These findings together suggest relatively greater physiological arousal and blunted day–night cardiovascular variation, which are consistent with stress-related autonomic patterns.  
- Night/morning HR deviations: The aggregate hourly deviations show pronounced negative deviations through the pre-dawn and early morning hours (e.g., 3–7am values −15 to −17 bpm) with small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS (hourly correlations in the 0.19–0.22 range for several early-morning hours). That pattern suggests the participant’s nocturnal-to-morning cardiovascular transitions are atypical in ways that, in this dataset, align modestly with higher perceived stress.  
- Variability in sleep timing and duration: Sleep start time SD (≈65 minutes) and sleep duration SD (≈86 minutes) are non-trivial and have small positive correlations with PSS (sleep start SD corr ≈ +0.17; duration SD corr ≈ +0.14), indicating irregular sleep timing/amounts that can accompany increased perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Self-report symptom and trait measures: Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5; Z ≈ −0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31; Z ≈ −1.02) are low relative to the study sample, and self-esteem is above average (RSES = 33; Z ≈ −0.73 in the favorable direction). Low symptom burden and higher self-esteem are robustly associated with lower perceived stress and suggest the participant does not report strong psychological distress.  
- Subjective sleep quality and behaviors: PSQI = 4 (classified as “good sleep”) and mean nightly sleep duration is only mildly below the study mean (median 6 h 43 min; Z ≈ −0.58). Napping is rare and substance use is minimal or absent — both of which reduce common behavioral contributors to stress in student samples. Health satisfaction is above average (score = 5; Z ≈ +0.55), which tends to track with lower perceived stress.  
- Low-reported anxiety-provoking behaviors and social habits: The participant reports little alcohol or non-prescribed drug use and limited engagement in time-consuming sedentary or high-stimulus leisure (short durations of internet, TV, video games). Although reduced socializing can be a risk factor in some contexts, the overall behavioral footprint suggests relatively few external stressors tied to substance use or disrupted sleep hygiene.

Integrated conclusion comparing to the study population mean:
Taken together, subjective reports and health-behavior items point toward lower perceived stress, while wearable physiology and circadian fragmentation point toward modestly increased physiological stress signaling. Given the relative magnitudes (notably the intradaily variability Z ≈ +1.09 and resting HR Z ≈ +0.53 versus pronounced negative Z-scores on symptom inventories), the overall balance is best characterized as near the population mean PSS score of 21.62, with a plausible—but not definitive—tilt toward slightly higher perceived stress when physiological signals are weighted. In short: inferred perceived stress is near the study mean (neither clearly much above nor much below), with wearable-derived autonomic/circadian markers indicating some physiological stress-related burden that is not strongly corroborated by self-reported mood or sleep disturbance.

Notes and caveats:
- Correlations reported here are associative and modest in magnitude; no metric alone provides definitive classification of perceived stress.  
- The physiological features are aggregated across days and hours and reflect typical patterns rather than acute episodes. Discordance between subjective reports (low symptoms) and physiological markers (greater fragmentation/higher resting HR) can reflect subclinical or early-stage physiological burden, situational factors not captured in the survey window, or individual differences in interoceptive awareness.  
- If the research aim is to target intervention or monitoring, the combination of circadian irregularity and modestly elevated resting HR suggests sleep-timing regularization and behavioral strategies that reduce autonomic arousal could be reasonable next steps to evaluate impact on perceived stress."
27407,"Summary of multimodal profile
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant shows a mixed profile of behavioral and physiological patterns. Key signals from self-report include elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52), together with generally intact mood and functioning (CES-D = 13, near sample mean; current happiness somewhat above average). Wearable data show relatively short and late nocturnal sleep (median 6 h 14 m, Z = -1.17; median sleep start ≈ 02:02), low resting heart rate and low mesor (RHR = 46.3, Z = -1.41; mesor = 65.18, Z = -1.20), reasonably preserved circadian structure (interdaily stability and intradaily variability near the sample mean), and pronounced evening increases in heart-rate deviation (largest positive deviations aggregated around 7–9 pm). These features together point to competing influences on perceived stress.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Elevated trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score (50; Z = 0.86) is meaningfully above the study mean and has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31). This indicates a dispositional tendency toward anxiety that is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.  
- Poor subjective sleep quality and timing: A PSQI of 10 (Z = 1.52, classified as disturbed sleep) together with short median sleep duration (≈6 h 14 m, Z = -1.17) and a very late habitual sleep onset (≈ 02:02) are consistent with sleep-related vulnerability. Poor subjective sleep and late, shortened sleep are frequently linked to elevated perceived stress and poorer daytime coping.  
- Irregular sleep variability: The standard deviation of sleep duration (≈120 minutes) is relatively high and sleep start time variability, while somewhat below average, together indicate occasional inconsistency; greater variability in sleep timing and duration is often associated with higher stress and worse subjective sleep.  
- Behavioral social/recreational indicators: Modest time spent socializing and limited engagement in leisure activities (e.g., not listening to music, low TV/video time) could reduce buffering resources that typically mitigate stress; these behaviors are neutral-to-modestly associated with PSS in the sample.  
- Small negative self-esteem signal: Rosenberg self-esteem is slightly below the sample mean (score = 36, Z = -0.31); lower self-esteem has a modest negative association with stress-buffering capacity in the cohort.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Low resting heart rate and low mesor: The participant’s RHR (46.3 bpm, Z = -1.41) and mesor (65.18, Z = -1.20) are substantially below the sample mean, a pattern commonly seen in individuals with higher aerobic fitness or lower baseline sympathetic tone. In this dataset higher resting heart rate correlates modestly with higher PSS, so the participant’s low RHR tends to point toward lower perceived stress.  
- Preserved circadian regularity: Interdaily stability (≈0.40, Z ≈ -0.08) and relatively low intradaily variability (0.51, Z ≈ -0.25) indicate circadian structure that is not markedly disrupted; more regular rhythms are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is slightly above average (Z = 0.39), consistent with stable day-to-day rhythmicity.  
- Evening physiological activation with otherwise low daytime baseline: Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the largest positive deviations in the evening (7–9 pm); in this sample those evening increases are either weakly or negatively correlated with PSS, which suggests the participant’s cardiovascular arousal is concentrated in the evening rather than showing sustained elevation across the day—this pattern could reflect engagement or activity rather than chronic physiological hyperarousal.  
- Functional indicators of competence and wellbeing: Academic performance is consistently high (GPAs 3.74–3.94), current happiness is modestly above average (Z = 0.55), and substance use is low; these behavioral/functional markers are usually associated with better perceived coping and lower stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean
Balancing the evidence, the strongest single signal for elevated perceived stress is the relatively high trait anxiety combined with subjectively disturbed and shortened sleep—both robust predictors of higher PSS in this sample. Countervailing evidence—especially the low resting heart rate and generally preserved circadian stability, plus markers of functional success (high GPA) and modestly elevated current happiness—moderates the interpretation and argues against a profile of severe or pervasive stress-related physiologic dysregulation.

Taking the full multimodal pattern into account, the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best characterized as modestly above the study population mean. In other words, their likely PSS level would be above the sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61) but not at an extreme elevation relative to the cohort. This conclusion emphasizes elevated dispositional anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep as the principal contributors to higher perceived stress, with physiological markers (low resting HR, preserved circadian structure) and functional indicators (academic performance, reported happiness) acting to attenuate the overall burden.

Practical implications (data-driven)
If the goal is to understand drivers of this participant’s elevated perceived stress relative to peers, the most actionable targets would be (1) addressing sleep quality and timing (shift earlier and stabilize schedule; cognitive-behavioral approaches for insomnia or sleep hygiene may help), and (2) exploring strategies to reduce baseline anxiety (psychological skills training, stress management interventions). Monitoring changes in subjective sleep (PSQI) and trait-state anxiety together with wearable markers (sleep duration/timing and RHR) would provide convergent evidence for intervention effects."
43794,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of signals but overall leans toward elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Several converging indicators—higher trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35), objectively elevated resting heart rate (70.8 bpm, Z = +1.50), disturbed self-reported sleep (PSQI = 8, Z = +0.59), late and variable sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:03; sleep start SD = 122 min, Z = +0.86), and low regularity of circadian heart-rate rhythms (interdaily stability = 0.20, Z = −1.73; amplitude Z = −1.76)—are consistent with greater physiological and psychological arousal and with behavioral patterns that commonly accompany higher perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress: Trait anxiety is notably elevated (STAI Z = +1.35), and this measure has a positive correlation with PSS in the study, making it one of the strongest self-report indicators pointing toward higher perceived stress. Sleep-related signals amplify that concern: although median nightly sleep duration is near seven hours (6 h 59 m, Z = −0.24), subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8), and night-to-night sleep timing is highly variable (sleep duration SD = 156 min, Z = +1.25; sleep start SD Z = +0.86). Wearable-derived circadian metrics show blunted amplitude and low interdaily stability (amplitude Z = −1.76; interdaily stability Z = −1.73) and slightly elevated intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability value 0.55), a pattern that often reflects irregular schedules and physiological dysregulation linked to stress. The relatively high resting heart rate (Z = +1.50) provides a physiological correlate of elevated autonomic arousal. Lower self-reported happiness and self-esteem (Happy Z = −0.53; Self-Esteem Z = −0.87) add psychosocial weight toward elevated perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress or mitigating factors: Several behavioral and symptom measures temper the picture. Depressive symptom burden is low–moderate (CES-D = 10, Z = −0.34; classified as not depressed), which argues against high global symptom severity that commonly co-occurs with extreme perceived stress. The participant reports low use of recreational and non-prescribed drugs and only modest alcohol use (wine 1–2×/week, Z = +0.94 but with negligible correlation to PSS), and engagement in social exercise (exercising with others 1–2×/week) and frequent music listening (>4 hours, Z = +2.06) could represent available coping or leisure activities. Median sleep duration near seven hours and absence of daytime naps (mean daily naps = 0, Z = −0.86) are not strongly indicative of chronic sleep deprivation. Some objective circadian and heart-rate measures (MESOR ~77 bpm, Z = +0.41; acrophase around 5:00 PM) remain within expected bounds for the sample, suggesting the participant does not show extreme deviation on every physiological axis.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSS: Taken together, the balance of evidence (notably high trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep with large night-to-night variability, blunted circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability, and elevated resting heart rate) points toward a level of perceived stress that is above the study population mean. Using the provided population context (PSS mean = 21.6, SD = 3.67), the participant’s profile is most consistent with being above the mean PSS score—likely moderately elevated rather than extremely high—though the lack of a direct PSS value for this participant and some mitigating features (low depressive score, near-normal sleep duration, limited substance use) introduce uncertainty. In sum: evidence favors “above the population mean” for perceived stress, with moderate confidence and with the caveat that the participant also exhibits several protective or non-elevating features.

Key uncertainties and considerations: The inference is probabilistic. Some wearable–PSS correlations in the dataset are small in magnitude, and several protective behaviors (limited substance use, normal BMI, near-seven-hour median sleep) or low depressive symptoms reduce the likelihood of extreme PSS elevation. Conversely, high trait anxiety and circadian irregularity are robust signals that merit attention. If clinical or research decisions depend on an individual-level PSS estimate, direct administration of the PSS or repeated momentary assessments would reduce uncertainty and provide a definitive participant score."
51437,"Summary: The available multimodal data show a mixed pattern: self-report trait measures and behavioral habits generally indicate lower psychological symptom burden and several resilience-related behaviors, whereas wearable-derived physiological and sleep/circadian metrics point to elevated physiological arousal and circadian disruption that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. Below I summarize the most salient features that pull in each direction and then provide an integrated statement about where this participant likely falls relative to the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68).

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Objective cardiovascular tone: Resting heart rate is elevated (73 bpm, Z = +1.77), and the participant’s MESOR (mean of the fitted circadian rhythm) is also above average (Z = +1.29). Elevated resting heart rate and higher mesor are modestly positively correlated with PSS in this dataset, suggesting greater tonic physiological arousal.
- Circadian irregularity and fragmentation: Intradaily variability is high (value 0.76, Z = +1.51), indicating a more fragmented within-day pattern of activity/heart rate; interdaily stability is low (Z = -0.82), indicating less consistent day-to-day timing. High intradaily variability and low interdaily stability are patterns that have been associated with elevated stress and poorer regulation.
- Blunted circadian amplitude and atypical nightly physiology: Circadian amplitude is low (Z = -1.59), consistent with a relatively flat daily heart-rate rhythm; aggregated hourly deviations show a pronounced positive deviation around midnight (12–1am value 25.6, Z = +3.91) and elevated values late at night, suggesting elevated physiological activation during late-night hours rather than a clear nocturnal decline.
- Sleep timing and subjective sleep quality: The median sleep duration is short (6 h 15 min, Z = -1.16) and the PSQI classifies sleep as disturbed (score = 6), which are both features commonly linked to greater perceived stress. Sleep onset is very late on average (median start time ≈ 2:14 AM), which can be associated with social- or stress-related evening arousal and with misalignment between social demands and circadian timing.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Low reported depressive and trait anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 4 (Z = -0.97; classified as not depressed) and STAI–Trait = 35 (Z = -0.62; classified as not anxious). Both instruments are positively correlated with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so low scores here are meaningful evidence for lower perceived stress.
- Self-esteem and functioning: Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z ≈ +0.96), and academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.69–3.72). Higher self-esteem and solid academic functioning are generally protective for perceived stress.
- Health behaviors and substance use: Frequent exercise (exercising alone and sports three times a week or more; Zs +1.07 and +1.58), minimal recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and only modest alcohol use are all behaviors associated with better stress management and are not consistent with high chronic perceived stress for most individuals.
- Social and health satisfaction: Moderate social activity (1–2 hours socializing) and above-average health satisfaction (Z ≈ +0.3) provide additional context suggesting adequate social resources and perceived physical well-being.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSS
- The pattern is mixed, but the most directly relevant self-report indicators of perceived stress (trait anxiety, depressive symptom scores, and self-esteem) point toward lower perceived stress relative to peers, while wearable physiology and sleep/circadian markers indicate elevated physiological arousal and circadian disruption that could either reflect subclinical stress-related physiology or behavioral patterns (late-night schedule) that increase physiological strain.
- Given that the strongest direct correlates of PSS in this dataset are the self-report symptom measures (CES-D and STAI) and those measures are low, and given that protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use, good academic function) are prominent, the overall balance of evidence favors an inferred perceived stress level that is at or modestly below the study population mean. Therefore the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best characterized as near to slightly below the population mean PSS (i.e., around or modestly under 21.62), rather than substantially above it.
- That said, the physiological and sleep/circadian signals are nontrivial and suggest a physiological profile (elevated resting heart rate, blunted amplitude, high intradaily variability, late and short sleep with disturbed subjective sleep quality) that could, over time or under increased psychosocial demands, push perceived stress upward. These wearable-derived indicators warrant attention even in the presence of low self-reported symptoms.

Clinical/scientific implications (brief)
- The combination of low self-reported affective symptoms and concordant positive behaviors alongside physiological/circadian markers of dysregulation suggests an opportunity for targeted behavioral interventions (sleep timing regularization, sleep extension, late-evening arousal reduction) that may reduce nocturnal physiological activation and improve circadian amplitude. Monitoring resting heart rate and intradaily variability over time would help determine whether the physiological pattern is stable or responsive to behavioral change.
- In summary: self-report and behavioral data point to relatively low perceived stress; physiological and sleep/circadian data point to elevated arousal and circadian disruption. Overall inference: perceived stress is likely near to slightly below the study population mean PSS, but the physiological profile indicates risk factors that could increase perceived stress if left unaddressed."
21932,"Summary: The multimodal profile shows a mixture of objectively healthy physiological patterns and a few subjective or circadian markers that could reflect episodic arousal or sleep disturbance. Trait symptom measures are low (CES-D = 4, z = -0.97; STAI-Trait = 28, z = -1.31) and self-esteem is relatively high (RSES z = 1.66). Wearable-recorded physiology shows a low resting heart rate (54.1 bpm, z = -0.48), a fairly regular circadian structure by interdaily stability (0.49, z = 0.67) and a robust sleep duration (median 8 h 14 min, z = 1.31) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD z = -1.15). These objective indicators and trait inventories generally point toward lower ongoing perceived stress. At the same time, the participant reports poorer subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep) and the heart-rate circadian pattern shows elevated heart-rate deviations at specific daytime and late-evening hours (notably 12–1 pm, z = 2.59; 1–2 pm, z = 2.11; 10–11 pm, z = 3.14), as well as relatively elevated intradaily variability (0.68, z = 0.95). Those latter features introduce some evidence for episodic physiological arousal or misalignment that may relate to higher perceived stress for portions of the day.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: 
- The PSQI score is 8 (z ≈ 0.59) which meets a common threshold for clinically meaningful sleep disturbance; subjective poor sleep quality is often associated with higher perceived stress even when objective sleep duration is adequate. 
- Intradaily variability from heart-rate data is elevated (0.68, z = 0.95) and correlates modestly positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17), suggesting more fragmented or irregular within-day physiology associated with higher stress. 
- Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced daytime and late-evening peaks (especially around midday and 10–11 pm; z-scores 2.11–3.14), which could indicate episodes of higher physiological arousal during those hours; several of these hourly deviations have weak positive correlations with PSS in the sample. 
- Self-reported momentary affect is somewhat muted (Happy score = 3, z = -0.53), and lower positive affect is associated with higher perceived stress in the study correlations (r ≈ -0.20).

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Low trait symptom scores: CES-D = 4 (z = -0.97) and STAI-Trait = 28 (z = -1.31) are both well below the study mean and are protective indicators against high perceived stress. 
- High self-esteem (RSES z = 1.66) and strong academic performance (GPA consistently high) are psychosocial resources that typically relate to lower perceived stress. 
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity are strong protective signals: median sleep of ~8 h 14 min (z = 1.31) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD z = -1.15) suggests reliable restorative sleep opportunity. 
- Resting heart rate is comparatively low (54.1 bpm, z = -0.48), and overall circadian regularity measures (interdaily stability z = 0.67) indicate a structured daily pattern; these patterns are generally associated with lower stress burden.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population: Integrating self-report and wearable-derived data, the balance of evidence favors a perceived stress level that is below the study population mean. Trait inventories and several objective physiological indicators (low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self-esteem, long and consistent nocturnal sleep, low resting heart rate, and above-average circadian stability) point toward lower perceived stress. Countervailing signals—disturbed subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8), elevated intraday variability, and distinct midday and late-evening heart-rate peaks—suggest intermittent physiological arousal and some subjective sleep complaints that could elevate perceived stress episodically. Given the relative strengths of the low trait symptom scores and robust objective recovery indicators, the most likely inference is that this participant’s perceived stress would be below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.64). This conclusion is probabilistic and qualified: small-to-moderate within-day physiological arousal and reported poor sleep quality flag opportunities for targeted follow-up (e.g., assessing evening routines, sleep quality, and midday stressors) because these could influence perceived stress even when trait measures appear low.

Uncertainty and cautions: Many wearable–PSS correlations in the dataset are small, so physiological signatures should be interpreted cautiously and in context with self-report. The apparent discrepancy between objective sleep duration and subjective sleep quality is notable and warrants further assessment before making strong inferences about the participant’s stress trajectory over time."
36385,"Summary and overall impression
The participant’s multi-modal profile presents a mixture of signals, with stronger indicators pointing toward greater perceived stress than the study population average but also several protective features. Elevations on self-report measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29, Z = 1.63) and trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76), together with relatively low self-esteem (RSES = 31, Z = −1.01) and a PSQI score indicating disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), represent the most salient psychosocial signals that typically covary with higher perceived stress. Objective physiology and behavioral patterns from the wearable device (moderately elevated resting heart rate, increased variability in sleep timing, and modest intraday fragmentation of the circadian heart‑rate rhythm) provide converging, though less strong, support for elevated stress-related arousal. Taking the totality of evidence into account, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is most consistent with being above the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.61).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Several features favor an interpretation of higher perceived stress. The CES‑D score is substantially elevated (29, Z = 1.63), and the STAI trait score is above average (49, Z = 0.76); both of these measures show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES‑D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so higher values on these scales are predictive of higher perceived stress. Low self‑esteem (RSES Z = −1.01) is also relevant because lower self‑esteem is modestly associated with higher PSS (r ≈ −0.15). Wearable-derived physiology shows a resting heart rate that is somewhat elevated relative to the sample (64.05 bpm, Z = 0.70); resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), consistent with greater physiological arousal. Sleep timing is irregular (sleep start time SD ≈ 140 minutes, Z = 1.26) and intradaily variability of the heart-rate rhythm is slightly elevated (IV = 0.56, Z = 0.10); both sleep timing variability and intradaily fragmentation have modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample (sleep‑start SD r ≈ 0.17; IV r ≈ 0.16), which is consistent with stress‑related disruption of daily structure. Subjective sleep difficulty (PSQI = 6) further supports the presence of sleep‑related complaints often accompanying higher stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
There are several countervailing signals that point toward lower perceived stress or resilience. Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is long (median = 8 h 47 min, Z = 2.00), and longer sleep duration has a weak negative association with PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.05), which could buffer stress effects. Interdaily stability of the circadian heart‑rate rhythm (IS = 0.44, Z = 0.25) and an average amplitude (Z ≈ 0.0) indicate a reasonably preserved 24‑hour structure rather than gross circadian disruption; higher interdaily stability tends to associate with lower PSS (r ≈ −0.12). Behavioral and contextual supports are also present: low recreational drug use, limited alcohol frequency beyond modest social drinking, regular though moderate exercise, active socializing (1–2 hours, Z ≈ 0.16), high trust (Z ≈ 0.83), above‑average self‑reported current happiness (4.0, Z ≈ 0.55), and strong academic performance (GPA in the upper range) are all factors that can mitigate perceived stress or reflect functioning despite strain. These features reduce the likelihood that stress is uniformly severe across domains.

Physiological and temporal pattern nuances
Wearable hourly heart‑rate deviations reveal a normal nocturnal trough and larger relative heart‑rate elevations in the evening hours (notably 7–8 pm: deviation ≈ +16.9, Z = 0.94). The acrophase (~5:23 PM), mesor (≈77 bpm, Z = 0.41) and moderate amplitude suggest an identifiable daily rhythm with somewhat elevated mean cardiovascular tone. Correlations between many hourly deviations and PSS are small and mixed; the strongest wearable‑based relationships with PSS in this profile were for metrics reflecting rhythm regularity and sleep timing variability rather than single‑hour elevations. Thus physiological data point toward modestly increased arousal and some circadian instability rather than profound dysregulation.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean
Balancing the strong self‑reported affective signals (elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms) and objective markers of irregular sleep timing and mildly elevated resting heart rate against protective factors (long total sleep duration, reasonable interdaily stability, social engagement, low substance use, and good academic functioning), the overall pattern is most consistent with perceived stress that is above the population mean. In other words, the participant’s inferred PSS is likely above the study sample average (population mean = 21.61), driven primarily by elevated mood‑symptom burden and anxiety proneness, with wearable signals providing supporting but more moderate evidence.

Clinical/research implications (brief)
For research or monitoring, the combination of elevated CES‑D/STAI scores and sleep‑timing variability suggests prioritizing follow‑up measures that track perceived stress over time and examine whether sleep‑timing stabilization or interventions targeting mood/anxiety (behavioral or counseling resources) reduce PSS. Objective long sleep duration alongside subjective sleep disturbance suggests disentangling sleep quality versus quantity in future questionnaires or sleep diaries."
54030,"Summary of self-report indicators (lower perceived stress): The participant’s self-report profile shows multiple strong signals that would ordinarily be associated with lower perceived stress. Scores on symptom measures are low — CES-D = 3 (z = -1.07, classified “not depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 27 (z = -1.41, “not anxious”) — while positive psychological resources are elevated (Rosenberg self‑esteem z = +1.52; self‑reported current happiness z = +1.64). Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, z = -0.8) is at the threshold typically interpreted as “good” rather than disturbed. The participant also reports limited substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non‑prescribed drugs) and moderate social engagement (socializing 2–3 hours daily, z ≈ +0.95). Taken together, these self‑report measures and lifestyle items point toward lower perceived stress relative to typical student samples.

Wearable-derived circadian and sleep features (higher perceived stress signals): In contrast to the protective self‑report profile, the wearable data show several physiologic and behavioral patterns that are often associated with greater perceived stress or circadian dysregulation. The participant’s sleep/wake timing is late and irregular: median sleep start ≈ 02:56 AM and median nightly sleep duration ≈ 6 h 18 min (z = -1.09), with relatively large night‑to‑night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 143 minutes, z ≈ +0.96) and elevated mean daily naps (0.22 naps/day, z = +1.75). Circadian rhythmicity derived from heart rate is flattened and unstable: intradaily variability is high (0.88, z = +2.36) and interdaily stability is low (0.28, z = -1.07), with a low autocorrelation at 24 h (0.18, z = -1.20) and reduced amplitude (6.78, z = -1.29). High intradaily variability and irregular sleep timing are risk signals because they index fragmented activity/rest structure and have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset.

Physiological heart‑rate timing and arousal pattern: Aggregate hourly heart‑rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir but also a pronounced positive deviation late in the evening (10–11 PM deviation = +14.19, z = +1.22). Resting heart rate is within the sample typical range (58.4 bpm, z ≈ 0). The combination of a relatively normal resting HR with reduced circadian amplitude and an elevated late‑evening heart‑rate deviation could reflect elevated physiological arousal in the pre‑sleep period or a shifted activity schedule, both of which are compatible with greater subjective strain even when daytime mood reports are positive.

Behavioral and psychosocial context (protective and mixed signals): Several behavioral factors are protective for perceived stress — limited substance use, consistent social contact, regular (albeit modest) sport/exercise with others, and above‑average health satisfaction (z ≈ +0.72). Conversely, limited solitary exercise and a lean body mass index (BMI = 17.76) are neutral-to-mixed with respect to stress in this sample. The participant’s pattern of using socializing and structured group activity (sports/exercise with others) may act as a buffer against perceived stress despite disrupted sleep and circadian markers.

Holistic synthesis and relative position versus the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most direct indicators of lower perceived stress come from self‑report affect and symptom measures (low CES‑D and STAI, high self‑esteem and happiness), while the wearable data point to circadian instability, shortened and irregular sleep, and elevated late‑evening physiological arousal — factors that tend to associate with higher PSS. Considering both domains, the overall pattern is most consistent with a participant whose perceived stress is at or modestly below the study sample mean rather than markedly elevated. Using the study population PSS mean (21.61, SD = 3.68) as context, the balance of protective self‑report signals against physiological risk signals supports an inference that this participant’s perceived stress is below the population mean (i.e., somewhat lower than average), but not by a large margin. This conclusion carries moderate confidence: self‑reported affect and symptoms strongly favor lower stress, but the objective circadian and sleep markers introduce meaningful uncertainty and suggest targets (sleep timing, regularity, pre‑sleep arousal) that could increase perceived stress over time if they persist."
34062,"Overall summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals. Trait and mood self-reports indicate relatively low levels of negative affect and stronger psychosocial resources (lower depressive and anxiety symptom scores, higher self‑esteem and happiness), while wearable-derived sleep quality and circadian regularity metrics show features more commonly associated with elevated stress or fragmented rhythms. Weighing both sets of information, the pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level that is at or slightly below the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.6), rather than distinctly above it. Below I summarize the evidence that argues for higher versus lower perceived stress, and then provide an integrated interpretation.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The participant reports poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 10, Z ≈ +1.52, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which is a robust correlate of elevated perceived stress. Wearable circadian metrics point to reduced day‑to‑day regularity and a blunted rhythm: interdaily stability is below the sample average (0.36, Z ≈ −0.41) and the autocorrelation at 24 hours is substantially low (Z ≈ −0.87), while amplitude is slightly reduced (Z ≈ −0.40). Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z ≈ +0.17), consistent with more fragmented activity/physiology across the day. Sleep start times are somewhat variable (SD ≈ 95 minutes, correlation with PSS positive), and mean daily naps are infrequent but slightly elevated (Z ≈ +0.82). These wearable-derived rhythm disruptions and subjective sleep disturbance are the main indicators that would predict increased perceived stress relative to peers.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Multiple self-report trait measures and behavioral factors point toward lower perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 7, Z ≈ −0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI Trait = 36, Z ≈ −0.52) are below the study mean. Self‑esteem is elevated (Rosenberg-like score Z ≈ +1.38) and current self-reported happiness is high (Z ≈ +1.64); health satisfaction is also high (Z ≈ +1.80). The participant exercises regularly (exercising alone/with others three times/week or more), reports moderate social time, has no recreational or non-prescribed drug use, and maintains generally adequate sleep duration (median ≈ 7 h 6 min, Z ≈ −0.11). Wearable cardiovascular markers point toward good fitness/low tonic arousal (resting heart rate = 45.7 bpm, Z ≈ −1.48; mesor low, Z ≈ −2.08), which typically associate with lower perceived stress. Academic performance (GPAs) and low substance use are additional behavioral supports for lower stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to population mean: The subjective sleep disturbance and indicators of circadian irregularity are notable risk signals for higher perceived stress, but they are counterbalanced by consistent evidence of low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem and happiness, regular exercise, low resting heart rate, and functional social/academic functioning. Given the relative magnitude of these signals, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s overall perceived stress is likely near or slightly below the study population mean (i.e., not markedly elevated). If expressed relative to the provided population statistics (mean PSS = 21.6, SD = 3.67), the profile would be interpreted as “near the mean, leaning modestly below the mean” rather than clearly above it.

Notes and implications: Because sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity are the strongest physiological/behavioral signals that point toward higher stress, these are the most actionable targets: improving sleep continuity and regular bed/wake timing could reduce physiological fragmentation even when mood and trait measures are favorable. Limitations include that PSS was not provided directly in this dataset and that correlations in the dataset are small to moderate; wearable and self‑report signals can reflect multiple processes (fitness, activity patterns, scheduled obligations) and do not by themselves establish causal relations with perceived stress. Monitoring sleep quality and circadian regularity alongside repeated PSS assessment would clarify whether the sleep/circadian signals precede or follow fluctuations in perceived stress."
18111,"Summary and overall impression:
The participant’s multimodal profile shows a pattern of elevated internalizing symptoms and disturbed sleep-related functioning alongside preserved fitness-like physiology and some adaptive behaviors. Self-report measures most strongly indicative of psychological strain include a CES-D score of 27 (z = +1.42, classified “Depressed”), an STAI–Trait score of 48 (z = +0.66, “anxious”), and a PSQI of 8 (z = +0.59, “Disturbed Sleep”). Wearable-derived circadian features show reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude = 6.21; z = -1.48) and low interdaily stability (0.24; z = -1.40), together with elevated evening heart-rate deviations (notably 8–9pm mean deviation = +20.14, z = +1.85). Taken together, these indicators are most consistent with greater perceived stress than the study population average. Relative to the study sample mean PSS (21.6), the available evidence supports an inference that this participant’s perceived stress is above the population mean.

Factors in the data that point toward relatively higher perceived stress:
- Elevated self-report symptom burden: The participant’s CES-D and STAI scores are well above sample averages and these measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), which is consistent with higher perceived stress. Current self-rated happiness is low (score = 2; z = -1.61), further aligning with elevated stress risk.  
- Subjective and objective sleep irregularity: PSQI = 8 indicates subjectively disturbed sleep. Although median sleep duration (7 h 16 m; z ≈ +0.10) is near average, sleep timing is late (median start ≈ 01:19) and night-to-night variability is substantial (sleep SD ≈ 113 minutes). High mean daily naps (0.27; z = +2.27) suggests daytime sleepiness or fragmented sleep, which often accompanies stress.  
- Blunted and irregular circadian/physiological rhythms: The circadian amplitude is notably low (z = -1.48) and interdaily stability is low (z = -1.40). Lower amplitude and greater intraday fragmentation have been associated with poorer mood and stress-related outcomes. The wearable hourly heart-rate profile shows pronounced evening increases (8–9pm and 9–10pm substantially above the mesor), which can reflect elevated evening physiological arousal or activity that parallels subjective stress.  
- Behavioral correlates: Moderate reductions in leisure activities typically associated with restoration (e.g., little reading, low music listening) and elevated internet usage may reflect coping or time-use patterns that co-occur with higher stress.

Factors in the data that point toward relatively lower perceived stress (protective or neutral signals):
- Physiological baseline and fitness indicators: Resting heart rate is within the typical range (58.2 bpm; z ≈ 0.01), suggesting no chronic sympathetic over-activation at rest. The participant’s BMI is in a healthy range, and GPAs are high, indicating functional academic performance and basic health.  
- Limited substance and drug use and some social activity: Alcohol use is modest (1–2 times/week) and non-prescribed drug use is not reported. Socializing with friends is present (1–2 hours), which can be a protective resource. These behaviors have small or mixed correlations with PSS in the sample.  
- Adequate average sleep duration: Although sleep timing and variability are concerns, median nightly sleep duration is within a typically adequate range (~7+ hours), which can buffer against stress-related impairment when maintained.  
- Small or inconsistent wearable-PSS associations: Several circadian metrics have weak correlations with PSS in the study sample (many r values are small), meaning wearable signals should be interpreted cautiously and are not determinative on their own.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the sample mean:
Balancing the evidence, the strongest signals indicating elevated perceived stress are the elevated depression and trait anxiety scores, subjective sleep disturbance, low self-reported happiness, and wearable indicators of reduced circadian amplitude with prominent evening heart-rate elevation. Protective signals (normal resting heart rate, adequate average sleep duration, modest substance use, intact academic performance) mitigate but do not outweigh the symptom and rhythm-related indicators. Considering the pattern and the magnitude of the self-report elevations, the most parsimonious inference is that this individual’s perceived stress is above the population mean PSS (study mean = 21.6). The data do not provide a definitive numeric PSS for the participant, but the constellation of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms plus sleep/circadian irregularity strongly suggest perceived stress higher than “near the mean.”

Limitations and uncertainty:
Conclusions are probabilistic. Correlations between specific wearable metrics and PSS in the sample are generally modest, and the hourly heart-rate values are temporally aggregated (so they indicate typical diurnal shape but not specific day-level reactivity). Self-report measures and wearables converge on disturbed sleep and elevated internalizing symptoms, strengthening confidence in the above-mean inference, but additional direct PSS measurement and event-level longitudinal data would refine the estimate and clarify causal direction."
59097,"Summary overview: The data show a mixed profile in which self-report measures point toward elevated internalizing symptoms and disturbed subjective sleep, while wearable-derived behavioral and circadian metrics indicate relatively stable daily rhythms and objectively long sleep duration. When these sources are weighed together, the self-report symptom burden (notably depressive and trait-anxiety scores) carries substantial signal for higher perceived stress; the wearable metrics, particularly measures of circadian regularity and sleep quantity, are more characteristic of lower perceived stress. Taking both modalities into account, the balance of evidence supports an overall perceived stress level that is above the study population mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Self-reported symptom scores are the most salient indicators favoring elevated perceived stress. The CES-D score of 28 (z = 1.53) is substantially above the sample mean and the CES-D → PSS correlation (r ≈ 0.29) suggests this depressive symptom burden is meaningfully associated with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 47, z = 0.56) also correlates with PSS (r ≈ 0.31) and adds convergent evidence for higher stress-proneness. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed; z = 0.59), which typically aligns with higher perceived stress. Low momentary happiness (current = 2.0, z = -1.61) and slightly below-average self-esteem (RSES z = -0.31) further support a profile in which the participant reports more negative affect and vulnerability—factors that are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. In sum, multiple self-report indices that correlate positively with PSS are elevated, which strongly suggests above-mean perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several objective wearable-derived measures point in the opposite direction. Circadian regularity metrics are robust: interdaily stability is high (value 0.57, z = 1.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (z = 1.23), while intradaily variability is low (z = -1.52). These patterns—greater day-to-day stability and lower fragmentation—are associated in this sample with lower PSS (small negative correlations or protective interpretation). The heart rate amplitude (z = 1.28) is relatively large, and amplitude in this dataset correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.16), consistent with healthier circadian organization. Median nightly sleep duration is long (8 h 23 m, z = 1.50) with low night-to-night variability and very few naps; consistent, sufficient objective sleep quantity likewise tends to be protective against perceived stress. Behavioral habits that may reduce stress risk are present as well: social time is higher than average (socializing 2–3 hours, z = 0.95) and engagement in sports (1–2×/week, z = 0.91) are features often linked to better coping or social support.

Integrated interpretation and weighting: The strongest and most direct signals for elevated perceived stress come from self-reported affective symptoms (depression, trait anxiety), subjective sleep disturbance, and low reported happiness—each of which shows meaningful correlations with PSS in the study sample. By contrast, the wearable-derived indicators (stable circadian rhythm, high amplitude, long objective sleep) are protective but their correlations with PSS in this dataset are smaller in magnitude. Resting heart rate is near the sample mean (z ≈ 0) and therefore does not materially shift the balance. Taken together, the larger effect sizes and clinical magnitude of the self-report symptom elevations outweigh the modest protective signal from circadian stability. It is therefore most consistent to infer that this participant experiences perceived stress that is above the population mean PSS score, despite relatively preserved objective sleep quantity and regular daily rhythms.

Explicit comparison to the study population mean: Based on the combined evidence, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is above the population mean (study mean PSS = 21.62). This conclusion is principally driven by elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) plus disturbed subjective sleep and low reported happiness, which are more strongly associated with higher PSS in this sample than the wearable indicators are associated with lower PSS.

Limitations and caveats: This assessment is probabilistic and correlational. Self-report elevations and wearable markers provide complementary information but do not establish causality. The wearable heart-rate aggregation is temporally averaged and cannot reveal acute stress reactivity or episode-level fluctuations. If more precise estimation of current perceived stress is required, a contemporaneous PSS score or repeated PSS sampling would reduce uncertainty and help reconcile modality differences."
24833,"Summary of salient multimodal findings:
The participant’s self-report and wearable data show a mixed profile. Key objective deviations from the study sample are in circadian regularity (notably low interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, and reduced circadian amplitude), a late and somewhat variable sleep schedule (median sleep start ~02:10 AM), and an elevated resting heart rate. Subjective measures show a PSQI score consistent with disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7) but relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 33) and low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 10). Self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average. These patterns produce partly opposing signals about perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Circadian irregularity is pronounced. Interdaily stability is very low (value 0.17, Z = -1.98) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is also markedly low (Z = -1.79); circadian amplitude is reduced (Z = -1.58). These wearable-derived circadian features have modest correlations with PSS in the sample (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12, amplitude r ≈ -0.17, autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17), and their magnitudes here are large relative to the study population, which suggests a meaningful association with higher perceived stress. 
- Sleep timing and subjective sleep quality are consistent with stress-related disruption. Median sleep start is late (≈ 02:10 AM) and sleep quality is rated as disturbed (PSQI = 7), both factors often associated with increased perceived stress. Although median sleep duration (≈ 6 h 55 min, Z = -0.32) is only modestly below the sample mean, late timing and the disturbed PSQI increase the likelihood of higher perceived stress.
- Physiological arousal indicators show elevation. Resting heart rate is above the sample mean (64.7 bpm, Z = 0.78) and has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14). Early-morning hourly heart-rate deviations (e.g., correlations at 3–6 AM ranging ~0.19–0.22) also modestly align with higher PSS in the sample, suggesting nocturnal physiological signatures that co-vary with stress.
- Intradaily variability (Z = 0.46) indicates somewhat fragmented day–night patterns; this metric correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16), consistent with a link to higher perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Trait affective measures are comparatively low-risk. Trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) are below the study mean and classify as low/non-clinical in this dataset; both measures are positively correlated with PSS in the sample, so relatively low scores argue for lower perceived stress. 
- Self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average (self-esteem Z ≈ 0.82; health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.8), and these measures have negative or weak correlations with PSS in the sample, which is consistent with lower perceived stress.
- Behavioral supports for stress regulation are present at modest levels: the participant reports regular physical activity (exercising 1–2 times per week), some socializing (1–2 hours), and no use of recreational/non-prescribed drugs. These habits and low levels of substance use are not strongly associated with higher PSS in the sample and therefore provide some protective context.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSS:
Putting the multimodal signals together, the strongest objective deviations are circadian irregularity and reduced circadian amplitude (z-scores near or below -1.5 to -2.0), together with disturbed subjective sleep timing/quality and a modestly elevated resting heart rate. These objective and sleep-related features have consistent, if modest, associations with higher perceived stress in the study correlations and are relatively large departures from sample norms, which weight the overall inference toward greater perceived stress. By contrast, trait affective measures (STAI, CES-D), self-esteem, and health satisfaction provide countervailing evidence consistent with lower perceived stress.

Overall, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is near the study population mean PSS but leaning somewhat above the mean (i.e., slightly higher than average). This conclusion reflects the combination of pronounced circadian/sleep irregularities and physiological arousal that tend to associate with elevated PSS, tempered by relatively low trait anxiety/depressive symptoms and higher self-esteem that counterbalance those effects. Quantitatively, the study sample PSS mean is 21.62 (SD 3.68); available measures do not provide a direct observed PSS score for this individual, so the statement above is an inferred placement relative to that distribution rather than a measured PSS value.

Limitations:
Interpretation relies on cross-sectional associations and sample correlations that are modest in magnitude. Wearable-derived circadian metrics and sleep timing are aggregated across the recording period and cannot establish temporality or causation. Individual PSS would be needed for a definitive placement; the synthesis above emphasizes relative magnitudes, z-scores, and known sample correlations."
84502,"Summary of multimodal patterns
The participant’s dataset shows a mixture of subjective reports and objectively measured behavioral/physiological patterns. Self-report instruments indicate elevated sleep disturbance (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52) and measurable depressive symptoms (CES-D = 18, Z = 0.49), alongside relatively low current happiness (self-rated 3.0, Z = -0.53). Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a generally stable and regular daily rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.55, Z = 1.16; 24-hour autocorrelation Z = 0.81) with a relatively low overall heart-rate level (MESOR = 67.0, Z = -0.94; resting HR = 52.6, Z = -0.66). Median objectively-measured sleep duration is adequate (7 h 31 min, Z = 0.41) but night-to-night variability in total sleep time is nontrivial (SD ≈ 109 min). Hourly heart-rate deviations indicate pronounced daytime increases (notably 4–6 pm with very high positive deviations and Z-scores) and substantial nocturnal decreases relative to the mesor.

Features suggesting relatively higher perceived stress
Several indicators in the data align with patterns typically associated with higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = 1.52), and PSQI elevations are commonly linked to greater perceived stress; the participant also reports lower happiness and modest depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 18, Z = 0.49), both of which correlate positively with PSS in the study sample (CES-D correlation with PSS ≈ 0.28; STAI correlation with PSS ≈ 0.31). Although trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) is not elevated, the positive correlations of mood-related measures with PSS suggest that the participant’s subjective distress and sleep complaints are relevant risk signals for higher perceived stress. Additional modest risk signals include increased intradaily variability in activity/HR (IV = 0.55, correlation with PSS ≈ 0.16) and elevated variability in total sleep time (SD ≈ 109 minutes), both of which can reflect irregularity or fragmentation associated with stress. Finally, some early-morning HR deviations show small positive correlations with PSS, consistent with greater physiological arousal for a subset of hours.

Features suggesting relatively lower perceived stress
Other data elements point toward behavioral and physiological factors that are typically protective or associated with lower perceived stress. Objectively-measured median nightly sleep duration is adequate (≈7.5 hours, Z = 0.41), and the participant reports no daytime naps (Z = -0.86) and relatively low substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs reported; Z-scores well below the sample mean), all of which reduce common stress-related risk exposures. The participant engages in social exercise frequently (exercised with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23), a behavior that is associated with lower stress and better mood in the cohort. Cardiovascular indicators also favor resilience: resting heart rate and MESOR are both lower than the sample mean (resting HR Z = -0.66; MESOR Z = -0.94), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower baseline physiological arousal. Circadian regularity metrics (high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation) indicate a structured daily rhythm, a characteristic that tends to be protective against stress-related dysregulation.

Holistic synthesis and comparison to the study population mean PSS
Taken together, the profile is mixed. Subjective distress markers—particularly disturbed sleep (high PSQI) and elevated depressive symptom score—are important signals that point toward greater perceived stress. Conversely, objective behavioral and physiological markers—adequate median sleep duration, strong circadian regularity, low resting heart rate, limited substance use, and frequent group exercise—suggest resilience and lower day-to-day stress exposure. Weighing the relative magnitudes and typical predictive value of these signals, the balance favors a modest elevation in perceived stress relative to the study sample. Therefore, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level is best characterized as slightly above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68). This judgment is driven largely by the high PSQI (Z = 1.52) and presence of depressive symptoms (CES-D Z ≈ 0.49), which in this dataset are reasonably associated with higher PSS scores.

Practical implications and measurement caveats
The pattern suggests two actionable focal points for monitoring or intervention: subjective sleep quality and mood-related symptoms. Given the discrepancy between adequate objective sleep duration and poor subjective sleep quality, further assessment of sleep fragmentation, nocturnal awakenings, sleep-related cognitions, or stressors that affect perceived sleep may be informative. Similarly, depressive symptomatology—while not extreme—warrants attention as a contributor to perceived stress. Interpretations should account for limitations: several correlations with PSS in the dataset are modest in magnitude, and some wearable signals (e.g., late-afternoon HR elevations) may reflect physical activity (e.g., exercise with others) rather than stress per se. Overall, the multimodal profile supports a conclusion of slightly elevated perceived stress relative to the cohort mean, with clear protective factors that could be leveraged clinically or in further research."
78783,"Summary: The multimodal profile shows a mixture of behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived signals. Several features (notably trait anxiety, disturbed and irregular sleep, increased intraday variability of rhythms, low current happiness and health satisfaction) point toward elevated perceived stress, while other features (regular exercise, relatively high circadian amplitude, low resting heart rate, moderate self-esteem and modest depressive symptom score) point toward relative resilience or lower stress. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress is likely above the study sample mean (sample mean PSS = 21.62), though not extreme.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety and mood: The STAI–Trait score of 43 (z = +0.17) is characterized as “anxious” and correlates positively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31), indicating a disposition toward greater perceived stress. Current happiness is low (score = 2.0; z = −1.61), which in this dataset is negatively correlated with lower PSS (r ≈ −0.19), consistent with higher stress. Depressive symptoms are not elevated (CES-D = 13, z ≈ 0), but CES-D correlates moderately with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), so any increase would amplify perceived stress risk.
- Sleep disturbance and irregular timing: Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8; z ≈ +0.59), a known correlate of higher stress. Wearable measures show a late median sleep start time (~02:51) and large variability in sleep start times (SD ≈ 173 minutes, z ≈ +1.99), plus elevated mean daily naps (z ≈ +2.23). The sleep timing irregularity and frequent napping align with reported associations to higher PSS (sleep variability r ≈ +0.17; naps r ≈ +0.14) and suggest fragmented or misaligned sleep that can sustain perceived stress.
- Circadian fragmentation: Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (value 0.58; z ≈ +0.24) and interdaily stability is relatively low (value 0.36; z ≈ −0.41). In this sample intradaily variability shows a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ +0.16) and lower interdaily stability is linked to higher stress (r ≈ −0.12). These patterns indicate less-regular physiological rhythms, which are commonly associated with greater perceived stress.
- Subjective health and well-being: Low health satisfaction (z ≈ −1.11) and limited engagement with some traditionally restorative hobbies (e.g., no reading; sedentary hobby low) further reinforce behavioral patterns that, in this dataset, co-occur with higher PSS.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Physical fitness and heart-rate circadian amplitude: Resting heart rate is low (52.8 bpm; z ≈ −0.64) and mesor is lower than average (z ≈ −0.58), which often reflect cardiovascular fitness and are generally not markers of high chronic stress. Amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is above average (12.31; z ≈ +0.49), and amplitude in this sample correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.17), suggesting stronger day–night differentiation that is associated with lower perceived stress.
- Active lifestyle and social engagement: The participant reports exercising alone ≥3 times/week (z ≈ +1.07) and socializing 2–3 hours/day (z ≈ +0.95); these behaviors are typically protective and have small associations with lower PSS in the sample. Recreational substance use is low (infrequent alcohol, no recreational or non-prescribed drugs), which is not contributing to elevated stress here.
- Self-esteem and depressive symptoms: Rosenberg self-esteem is relatively high (39; z ≈ +0.11) and CES-D is not elevated (13; z ≈ −0.03). Self-esteem has a small negative association with PSS (r ≈ −0.15), and the absence of marked depressive symptoms reduces the likelihood that PSS would be strongly elevated solely on mood grounds.
- Behavioral leisure: Some higher-engagement leisure behaviors (video game time high, z ≈ +1.71) have negative or small correlations with PSS in this dataset (video games r ≈ −0.14), consistent with possible stress-buffering through these activities for this individual.

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement
Weighing both sides, the profile leans toward elevated perceived stress relative to the sample mean. The most influential indicators are the participant’s anxious trait, poor subjective sleep quality combined with late and irregular sleep timing and high nap frequency, and measurable circadian fragmentation—each of which has consistent, positive associations with PSS in this dataset. These stress-promoting signals outweigh protective signals such as frequent exercise, relatively robust heart-rate amplitude, and low resting heart rate, which mitigate but do not fully offset the stress-related pattern. Therefore, relative to the study population mean PSS of 21.62, the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best described as above the population mean.

Practical implications to consider (data-driven)
- Sleep regularity and timing appear to be prominent modifiable targets: reducing night-to-night variability and shifting sleep timing earlier or more consistently could reduce physiological fragmentation that associates with higher PSS.
- Addressing trait anxiety through evidence-based strategies (e.g., cognitive-behavioral techniques, stress-management practices) may lower perceived stress given the strong correlation between STAI and PSS.
- Existing strengths (regular exercise, social time, low resting heart rate) may be leveraged as protective resources in interventions aimed at reducing perceived stress."
25197,"Indicators consistent with relatively greater perceived stress
The participant shows several self-report and behavioral features that, in this sample, are associated with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 50, Z = 0.86) is elevated relative to the cohort and has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31), making it one of the stronger individual signals here. Subjective sleep quality is also flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 7), and wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration is below the sample average (6 h 34 min, Z = -0.77), both of which are commonly linked to greater perceived stress and poorer coping. The participant reports below-average momentary happiness (Current Happy = 3.0, Z = -0.53), which is negatively correlated with wellbeing measures and modestly associated with higher PSS in the study (r ≈ -0.19). Late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:45) further aligns with profiles that can amplify daytime stress or difficulties with sleep-related recovery. Together, these features (elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, shortened sleep duration, late sleep timing, and lower self-reported happiness) point toward psychosocial strain that would tend to increase perceived stress relative to peers.

Indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Several physiological and behavioral characteristics point in the opposite direction—toward resilience or lower perceived stress. The participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68), which often reflects higher cardiovascular fitness and lower baseline autonomic arousal. Circadian-structure metrics derived from heart rate are generally coherent: amplitude is above average (Amplitude Z = 0.64), intradaily variability is lower than average (Intradaily Variability Z = -0.53), and interdaily stability is near the cohort mean (Interdaily Stability Z = 0.09). This pattern — robust amplitude with lower fragmentation — indicates a consolidated, regular daily rhythm rather than one characterized by fragmentation or large day-to-day instability, a profile that is typically associated with better physiological regulation and lower stress vulnerability. Self-report indices of functioning also contain protective signals: low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34, classified as not depressed), high self-esteem (Rosenberg score reported above sample mean, Z ≈ 0.82), and relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 1.63). Behavioral habits such as absence of recreational drug use, modest alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week) and low nap frequency further suggest relatively adaptive lifestyle patterns that do not strongly indicate elevated stress.

Physiological timing and activity-related features (nuanced)
The aggregated hourly heart rate deviations show a pronounced afternoon activity peak (notably 3–4 pm, deviation Z = +5.3) and large positive deviations across midday and afternoon hours. This is consistent with a relatively strong daytime activity bout (exercise, class/work demands, or other scheduled activity) in the mid-afternoon; the pattern is accompanied by strong nocturnal heart rate reductions (large negative deviations overnight) indicating physiological down-regulation during sleep. These features support the interpretation of an organized daily schedule and preserved nocturnal recovery. Importantly, most hourly heart-rate deviations show little to no positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (many hourly correlations near zero), suggesting these activity-timing signals are more reflective of routine behavior than direct markers of perceived stress for this sample.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population
Taken together, the evidence is mixed but leans toward a modestly elevated level of perceived stress relative to the study sample. The strongest single stress-related signal is elevated trait anxiety (STAI), accompanied by disturbed subjective sleep and shortened sleep duration — factors that, in this dataset, are meaningfully associated with higher PSS. Counterbalancing those signals are objective indicators of physiological resilience and behavioral regularity (low resting heart rate, preserved circadian amplitude, low intradaily variability), plus low depressive symptoms and high self-rated health, all of which predict lower perceived stress. On balance, the profile is most consistent with a participant whose perceived stress is near-to-slightly-above the sample mean rather than clearly below it. Using the study population PSS context (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), the pattern of elevated anxiety and sleep disturbance paired with physiological resilience suggests the participant would likely fall within approximately one standard deviation above or near the mean PSS (i.e., in the general vicinity of the central tendency rather than markedly lower). This conclusion emphasizes relative risk factors (anxiety, disturbed/insufficient sleep) that could push perceived stress upward despite several protective physiological and psychosocial assets."
23270,"Summary — overall pattern:
The available multimodal data depict a student with a mixed set of risk and protective features for perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = +0.56) and modest depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11, Z = −0.24) are the most salient psychological risk signals that typically track with higher perceived stress in this sample. At the same time, multiple behavioral and physiological indicators point to relatively strong restorative factors (long, regular sleep; frequent exercise; low substance use; low resting heart rate). Taking the full pattern together, the participant’s data are most consistent with a perceived stress level that is near to, and perhaps slightly above, the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). The data do not converge on a profile suggesting substantially elevated perceived stress well above the sample mean.

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress:
- Elevated trait anxiety: The STAI score is above the sample mean (47, Z = +0.56) and this measure shows a positive correlation with PSS in the cohort (r ≈ 0.31). Higher anxiety proneness is a robust correlate of higher perceived stress and is the single strongest psychological risk signal in these data.  
- Circadian fragmentation / within-day variability: Non‑parametric circadian metrics show somewhat elevated intradaily variability (value = 0.60, Z = +0.39) and reduced interdaily stability (0.38, Z = −0.24). Intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16), and reduced day-to-day rhythm stability is also associated with stress-related outcomes in prior work. These metrics suggest more fluctuation in activity/heart rate across the day and less stable daily structure, which can accompany higher perceived stress.  
- Daytime heart-rate elevations relative to mesor: Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced positive deviations in late morning (e.g., 9–11am: +19.7 to +18.3 bpm, Z-scores ~ +1.9–2.1). While the correlations with PSS for individual hourly deviations are small, the pattern indicates substantial daytime physiological activation during working/academic hours, which could reflect sustained daytime demand or arousal consistent with higher perceived stress.  
- Limited social/recreational downtime: Self-reported time socializing and on sedentary/recreational activities is low (socializing 16–30 minutes, large negative Z), which may reflect constrained leisure time or lower social buffering — factors that can be associated with higher perceived stress.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress:
- Good subjective sleep quality and long sleep duration: PSQI = 4 (Z = −1.26; classified as “Good Sleep”) and median wearable sleep duration ≈ 8 h 49 min (Z = +2.03). These are strong protective signals: good subjective sleep and objectively long typical sleep are usually linked to lower perceived stress and better daytime functioning. The sleep timing is also relatively consistent (median sleep start ≈ 22:50 with modest variability).  
- Regular exercise and low substance use: The participant reports frequent exercise/sports (exercise alone ≥3×/week; sports ≥3×/week; Z-scores positive) and no alcohol or recreational drug use. Frequent physical activity and absence of substance use are both associated with lower perceived stress and better mood regulation.  
- High functioning and positive self-evaluations: Strong academic performance (GPAs ≈ 3.9–4.0), a relatively high happiness rating (current happy = 4, Z = +0.55), and above‑average health satisfaction (5 on a 1–7 scale, Z = +0.55) are consistent with effective functioning and resources that buffer perceived stress. Resting heart rate and mesor are relatively low (RHR = 54.9 bpm, mesor ≈ 69.5 bpm; both slightly below sample mean), a pattern often seen in physically fit individuals and not typically indicative of chronic sympathetic over-arousal.

Physiology and circadian summary (integration of wearable signals):
Cosinor-derived metrics show a modest mesor and modest amplitude (mesor Z = −0.61; amplitude Z ≈ −0.02) with an acrophase in mid-afternoon (≈ 2:42 PM). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderate-low (0.32), and intradaily variability is somewhat elevated; together these suggest that while there is a recognizable circadian pattern, day-to-day regularity and within-day smoothness are reduced compared with some peers. The large nocturnal heart-rate drops (strong negative deviations overnight) and low resting heart rate point toward good nocturnal recovery and cardiovascular fitness, which are protective. The most notable physiological concern relative to stress is the combination of higher within-day variability plus pronounced daytime HR elevations during mid-morning—consistent with recurrent daytime arousal without evidence of nocturnal hyperarousal.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the population mean PSS:
Balancing the evidence, the strongest single risk signal is elevated trait anxiety (STAI), supported by some circadian fragmentation and daytime physiological activation. Counterbalancing these are robust protective factors — good subjective and objective sleep, frequent exercise, minimal substance use, strong academic functioning, and positive health and happiness ratings. Overall, this mixed but generally resilient profile suggests perceived stress that is near the study sample mean but with a modest tendency toward elevated stress relative to the group. In succinct terms: the participant is most consistent with a PSS level “near to slightly above the population mean” rather than substantially above or below it. This conclusion aligns with the relative magnitudes and directions of the primary measures (notably STAI Z ≈ +0.56 and strong sleep/exercise protective signals).

Notes and caveats:
- These inferences use cross-sectional summary metrics and population correlations; they do not substitute for a direct PSS score or clinical assessment.  
- Several correlations with PSS in the dataset are small in magnitude; therefore, individual-level interpretation should weigh the strongest, consistent signals (here, trait anxiety and sleep/exercise behaviors) more heavily."
70125,"Summary and overall impression:
Across self-report and wearable-derived metrics the participant shows a mixed profile with stronger signals pointing toward elevated perceived stress than toward low stress. Key symptom measures that most strongly predict higher perceived stress in the study sample — depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) — are meaningfully elevated (CES-D = 24, Z = 1.11, classified as “Depressed”; STAI = 50, Z = 0.86, “anxious”) and both have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28 and 0.31). Sleep disturbance is also present (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep) together with late and irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:44) and high night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 159 minutes, Z = 1.32). Circadian rhythm measures derived from heart rate (reduced interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, low 24-hour autocorrelation) indicate weaker day-to-day rhythmicity. Taken together, these features (elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms, disturbed and irregular sleep, and reduced circadian regularity) are the most salient indicators in the dataset that align with relatively higher perceived stress.

Factors indicating relatively higher perceived stress (evidence and relative weight):
- Elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores: The CES-D and STAI elevations are the strongest and most proximate psychosocial predictors of higher PSS in the sample (both positive correlations with PSS ≈ 0.28–0.31), and their Z-scores (>0.8–1.1) indicate values well above the study mean.  
- Sleep disturbance and variability: PSQI >5 and a large sleep-duration SD (Z = 1.32) indicate poor and inconsistent sleep, which correlates positively (albeit modestly) with PSS in the sample (sleep variability r ≈ 0.13). Late median sleep onset (~01:44) suggests circadian misalignment that commonly co-occurs with higher stress.  
- Reduced circadian regularity: Lower interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.57), lower amplitude (Z ≈ -0.52), and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z ≈ -0.70) indicate a less robust heart-rate rhythm. Disrupted circadian structure is conceptually and empirically associated with elevated stress and poorer mood; these metrics collectively point toward that pattern in this participant.  
- Low reported social trust and modest health satisfaction: Trust (Z = -1.74) and health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.95) are below sample averages and can be contextually relevant to stress vulnerability.

Factors indicating relatively lower perceived stress (evidence and relative weight):
- High self-esteem and moderate positive affect: Rosenberg self-esteem is high (39/40, Z ≈ 0.11) and self-reported current happiness is above average (Z ≈ 0.55). In the sample these traits correlate negatively with PSS (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15; happiness r ≈ -0.20), suggesting protective psychological resources.  
- Engagement in exercise and low resting heart rate: The participant reports exercising alone three or more times per week (Z ≈ 1.07) and shows a relatively low resting heart rate (53 bpm, Z ≈ -0.61). Both factors are plausibly protective against chronic perceived stress — exercise confers resilience and low resting HR is commonly a marker of cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic physiological arousal.  
- Evening physiological activation pattern that may index active/social time: Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated values in the evening (particularly 7–9 pm), which in the study are modestly associated with lower PSS (negative correlations for those evening hours). If those deviations reflect regular evening activity or social engagement, they could be stress-buffering for this individual.  
- Low use of recreational/non-prescribed drugs and only moderate alcohol consumption: Substance use patterns are not elevated in ways that would clearly amplify stress in this sample.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
Balancing the evidence, the strongest and most directly relevant indicators (clinically meaningful elevations in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety; disturbed, late, and irregular sleep; reduced circadian rhythm robustness) point toward higher perceived stress for this participant. Protective factors (high self-esteem and happiness, regular exercise, low resting heart rate) are present and may moderate the overall level of perceived stress, but they do not fully offset the magnitude of mood-symptom elevations and circadian/sleep disruption. Therefore, when placed into the context of the study sample (population PSS mean = 21.6, SD = 3.66), the overall pattern is most consistent with a PSS level above the population mean. The combination of symptom-level elevations and disrupted sleep/circadian markers suggests a moderate upward deviation from the sample mean rather than a marginal or negligible difference.

Limitations of inference:
This conclusion is probabilistic and based on correlational associations and relative z-scores in the study sample rather than a direct PSS score for the participant. Some wearable correlations with PSS in the sample are small, and multiple features point in opposite directions; thus the assessment reflects an integrated, weighted interpretation rather than a definitive measurement."
67192,"Summary of multimodal profile
The participant’s multimodal data show a mixed but overall stress-prone profile: self-report measures of mood and anxiety are notably elevated, subjective sleep quality is disturbed, and several wearable-derived cardiovascular indices indicate relatively high tonic and evening arousal. At the same time, objective sleep duration is within a normative range and several circadian-regularity metrics are relatively strong, and the participant reports substantial social time and low substance use. Considering the strengths and limitations of each data source and the provided correlations with PSS, the balance of evidence points toward a perceived stress level that is above the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.59).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Affect and trait risk markers: The participant scores highly on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32; Z = 1.95; CES-D–PSS correlation = 0.27) and on trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z = 1.65; STAI–PSS correlation = 0.31). Both of these self-report scores are among the stronger predictors of higher PSS in the study sample and therefore strongly suggest elevated perceived stress. Low self-esteem (RSES = 33; Z = -0.73; correlation with PSS = -0.15) and low reported happiness (current = 2.0; Z = -1.61; correlation = -0.18) further align with increased perceived stress in this dataset. 
- Subjective sleep disturbance and sleep-timing irregularity: The PSQI score of 7 (classified as disturbed sleep) indicates poorer subjective sleep quality, which is commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Sleep start time is late (median ≈ 01:15 AM) with a large night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 110 min; Z = 0.59), and sleep-duration variability is substantial (SD ≈ 108 min). These timing irregularities and subjective disturbance are consistent with patterns that correlate positively with higher PSS in the sample (sleep variability correlations are modestly positive in the dataset).
- Elevated tonic and evening physiological arousal: Wearable-derived cardiovascular measures show elevated baseline cardiac measures (Mesor = 88.67, Z = 2.01) and a higher resting heart rate (71.8 bpm; Z = 1.62). There are pronounced positive deviations from the mesor in late evening hours (notably 10–11 pm: +16.3 bpm, Z = 1.55; 9–10 pm and 11–12am also elevated), suggesting higher evening physiological activation. Although the direct correlations of mesor and resting HR with PSS are modest (0.04 and 0.12 respectively), the combination of high depressive/anxiety symptoms and elevated cardiac tone supports inference of greater perceived stress.
- Low health satisfaction and underweight BMI: Self-reported health satisfaction is very low (1.56; Z = -2.03), which, though only weakly correlated with PSS in the sample, adds to the overall signal of distress. BMI is low (17.8), which may reflect health or nutritional vulnerability that can co-occur with stress-related symptomatology.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Adequate objective total sleep and limited napping: Median objectively-measured sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 16 minutes (Z = 0.10), which is within the typical recommended range and may attenuate stress effects. Mean daily naps are rare (0.13/day; Z = 0.7), arguing against pervasive daytime somnolence that sometimes accompanies chronic high stress.
- Circadian regularity and activity structure: Non-markers of circadian disruption provide a protective signal. Interdaily stability (0.52; Z = 0.91) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47; Z = 1.23) are relatively high, and intradaily variability is not elevated (IV = 0.50; Z = -0.32). In this sample, higher interdaily regularity and stronger 24-hour autocorrelation are associated with lower PSS (correlations ≈ -0.13 to -0.18), so the participant’s relatively strong regularity metrics are a countervailing sign of lower perceived stress. Amplitude of the rhythm is moderately positive (12.27; Z = 0.48), also consistent with a preserved circadian rhythm.
- Behavioral supports and low substance risk: The participant reports extensive socializing (more than 4 hours; Z = 2.53), limited use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs, and only modest alcohol consumption. These lifestyle factors can be protective or indicative of social resources; in this dataset their correlations with PSS are small, but they nevertheless provide behavioral context that could buffer perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the population mean
Balancing these elements, the strongest, most PSS-relevant signals are the high depressive symptoms (CES-D) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI), both of which are established correlates of higher perceived stress in this study (correlations 0.27 and 0.31). These large psychological signals are supported by disturbed subjective sleep and by elevated evening and baseline heart-rate metrics, together creating a coherent pattern consistent with elevated perceived stress. Countervailing evidence—adequate objective sleep duration, relatively strong circadian regularity, frequent social interaction, and low substance use—moderates but does not outweigh the high internalizing symptom burden and physiological arousal. On balance, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is above the study sample mean PSS of 21.59.

Degree of confidence and caveats
This inference is based on convergent signals from self-report and wearable measures and on the provided correlations between those measures and PSS in the sample, but it is not a direct PSS score and should be treated as probabilistic. Several correlations in the dataset are modest in size; therefore, while the psychological symptom scores (CES-D and STAI) strongly push the inferred PSS upward, the precise magnitude relative to the mean cannot be determined without the actual PSS value. Additionally, some physiological markers (e.g., high interdaily stability) point in an opposite direction, highlighting the heterogeneity of behavioral and physiological adaptations to stress.

If desired, I can (a) provide a brief prioritized list of the most influential features driving this inference, or (b) estimate a likely PSS range (e.g., approximate z-range) with stated uncertainty based on the available correlational structure."
97448,"Summary — overall inferred stress level:
Taken together, the multimodal profile (questionnaires, wearable physiology, and sleep/behavior measures) is most consistent with a perceived stress level at or modestly below the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). Several robust indicators (low self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety scores, low resting heart rate, and relatively high circadian regularity) point toward lower perceived stress, while a few features (subjective sleep disturbance, late habitual sleep onset, and elevated evening heart-rate deviations) suggest pockets of physiological or behavioral arousal that could elevate perceived stress situationally. Given the balance of evidence and the generally small correlations between many features and PSS in this dataset, the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is near to slightly below the sample mean.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress:
Self-report measures associated with lower stress are prominent: CES-D = 3 (Z = -1.07, classified “Not depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 33 (Z = -0.82, “not anxious”), both substantially below population averages. Self-esteem and interpersonal trust are relatively elevated (self-esteem Z = 0.4; trust Z = 1.47), and the participant reports regular exercise alone three or more times per week (exercise Z = 1.07) — a behavioral pattern often linked to reduced perceived stress. Physiologically, resting heart rate is low (50.8 bpm, Z = -0.87), which commonly reflects higher cardiovascular fitness and is modestly associated with lower stress in this sample (correlation with PSS ~ +0.14 but absolute level here is low). Circadian/actigraphic rhythm metrics indicate strong daily structure: interdaily stability = 0.53 (Z = 1.0) and 24‑hour autocorrelation = 0.46 (Z = 1.15). The cosinor amplitude is relatively large (amplitude = 14.78, Z = 1.29), and the acrophase occurs in late afternoon (≈ 5:00 PM); these features together imply coherent, stable daily heart-rate rhythms that are generally associated with lower stress in this sample (amplitude and stability correlate negatively with PSS).

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress:
There are also signals that could reflect elevated or situational stress. The PSQI score is 6 (Z ≈ -0.33) and crosses the common clinical threshold for disturbed sleep, indicating poorer subjective sleep quality despite objectively adequate median sleep duration (7 h 12 min). The participant’s median sleep onset is late (≈ 01:44), which may reflect eveningness, social/work schedule strain, or nighttime arousal that can relate to higher perceived stress in some contexts. Wearable hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced relative elevations across afternoon and evening hours (notably large positive deviations around mid-afternoon and 8–10 PM, with Z-scores up to ~2.2), suggesting higher physiological activation in the later part of the day; evening heart-rate elevations could reflect late activity, caffeine/alcohol use, or psychological arousal. Alcohol use at a frequency of 1–2 times per week (beer/wine/liquor) is slightly above average (Z ≈ 1.0) and could be a behavioral coping correlate. Finally, self-reported current happiness is somewhat lower than average (Z ≈ -0.53), which, although modest, can co-occur with increased perceived stress.

Sleep/regularity and circadian physiology interpretation:
Objectively, sleep quantity is adequate and relatively consistent (median duration ~7h12m; sleep-duration SD ≈ 63 minutes, Z = -0.86), and daily napping is minimal (mean daily naps 0.13, Z = 0.7). The participant’s heart-rate circadian profile is well structured (high interdaily stability, high amplitude, and a clear acrophase), which tends to be protective with respect to perceived stress in this dataset. The late median sleep onset indicates a shifted sleep schedule, but low variability in sleep timing (SD Z ≈ -0.43) suggests that the participant maintains that late schedule consistently rather than irregularly; consistent late timing has different implications than highly irregular sleep for stress and functioning. The combination of good rhythm regularity, low resting HR, and consistent sleep duration supports resilience to chronic perceived stress despite the late timing and some subjective sleep complaints.

Uncertainty and magnitude of effects:
Most associations between individual variables and PSS in the study are modest (correlations generally small in absolute value), so inferences carry uncertainty. Several protective and risk indicators coexist for this participant; protective signals (low depression/anxiety scores, high circadian stability, low resting heart rate, regular exercise) are comparatively stronger and more coherent than the risk signals (PSQI slightly above threshold, late sleep onset, evening HR elevations). Therefore the aggregate interpretation favors a perceived stress level near or slightly below the population mean rather than markedly above it.

Concise conclusion:
Balancing all available evidence, the participant’s profile is best described as having perceived stress near to modestly below the study sample mean (i.e., not elevated relative to peers). The participant shows physiological and behavioral characteristics consistent with resilience (stable circadian rhythm, low resting HR, low affective symptoms, regular exercise), but there are actionable indicators — subjective sleep disturbance, late sleep timing, and evening physiological arousal — that could contribute to situational increases in perceived stress and which may warrant monitoring or targeted behavioral adjustments."
67177,"Summary and overall impression
The combined self-report and wearable data portray a participant with several concurrent signals of elevated affective distress alongside robust, regular physiological rhythms. Trait measures of anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) and depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28) are above the study mean and correlate positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28 respectively), indicating these stable symptom elevations would tend to track with higher perceived stress. At the same time, heart-rate–based circadian metrics (high interdaily stability Z = 1.24, high 24-h autocorrelation Z = 1.40, modest amplitude Z = 0.82, low intradaily variability Z = −0.74) indicate a well-structured day–night physiological rhythm, which in this sample correlates negatively with PSS and therefore represents a feature that would tend to be associated with lower perceived stress. Because a direct PSS score for the individual is not provided, the inference below integrates these converging and diverging signals to place the participant relative to the sample mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Several behavioral and self-report indicators point toward higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are elevated relative to the study sample (STAI Z = 0.46; CES-D Z = 0.28), and both measures show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (≈0.31 and 0.28), meaning higher values on these scales tend to accompany higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is also rated as disturbed (PSQI = 7, above common clinical cutoffs; Z = 0.13), and median nightly sleep duration is slightly below average (6 h 54 min, Z = −0.35) with a fairly large night-to-night start-time variability (sleep start SD = 87 min), which can impair recovery and increase perceived stress. Self-reported happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = −1.61) and self-esteem is comparatively low (RSES = 31, Z = −1.01); in the sample these constructs are associated with PSS in the expected directions (lower self-esteem and happiness linked to higher perceived stress). Physiologically, resting heart rate is elevated relative to peers (65.2 bpm, Z = 0.84), which may reflect higher baseline autonomic arousal; resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.13). Lifestyle data (minimal exercise, low socializing, limited recreational diversification, BMI ≈ 30, and low health-satisfaction) may further compound subjective stress through reduced social/physical coping resources.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Several wearable-derived circadian features argue for lower perceived stress or for resilience factors that can buffer stress. Interdaily stability (Z = 1.24) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.40) indicate a highly regular daily heart-rate rhythm and consistent timing of activity/rest across days; in this sample both measures correlate negatively with PSS (r ≈ −0.12 and −0.18), suggesting regularity is protective. Low intradaily variability (Z = −0.74) implies limited fragmentation of activity across the day, which is generally associated with better sleep–wake consolidation and lower stress levels. The participant reports no use of alcohol, recreational, or non-prescribed drugs (Z-scores strongly negative), and no daytime napping; abstinence from these substance and sleep-behavior risk factors removes common contributors to elevated stress and sleep disruption. Wearable amplitude of the circadian heart-rate rhythm is moderate-to-high (Z = 0.82) and negatively correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.17), consistent with a robust day–night physiological contrast that tends to align with lower perceived stress.

Synthesis and comparative statement relative to the study mean
Weighing the evidence, the participant exhibits a mixed profile: affective symptom measures (anxiety and depressive symptoms), poorer subjective sleep quality, low happiness and self-esteem, elevated resting heart rate, low physical activity, and limited social/recreational engagement each point toward a higher perceived stress burden. Counterbalancing those factors are strong, regular circadian physiology and the absence of substance use or habitual napping, features that are associated with lower PSS in this sample. Taken together, the balance of psychological symptom signals (particularly the elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores) suggests that the participant’s overall perceived stress is likely above the study population mean (Population PSS mean = 21.61). The elevation is not of an extreme magnitude based on the modest Z-scores of several measures, so the participant is best characterized as likely modestly above the study mean rather than an extreme outlier.

Uncertainty and practical implications
This inference is probabilistic: no direct PSS score for the participant was provided and several physiological indicators moderate the symptom-based signals. If the goal is to reduce perceived stress, the data identify actionable targets that would be coherent with both physiological and psychological findings—improving subjective sleep quality and consistency, increasing daytime physical activity and social/recreational engagement, and addressing elevated anxiety/depressive symptoms—while leveraging the participant’s existing strong circadian regularity as a resilience resource."
87328,"Summary — overview of available multimodal evidence:
The participant’s profile shows a mixture of behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived physiological features. Trait and affective self-reports are largely in the low-symptom / positive range (very low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, elevated self‑esteem and self‑reported happiness), while objective physiology and circadian metrics indicate a pronounced and regular daily rhythm with relatively low resting cardiovascular tone. Sleep quantity is within a typical range (median 7 h 25 min, Z = 0.30) but subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed (PSQI = 7). Taken together, these cross-domain features point to more evidence for lower perceived stress than for higher perceived stress, with some specific behavioral and sleep-related elements that could elevate perceived stress.

Features that align with higher perceived stress:
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7; classified as “Disturbed Sleep,” Z = 0.13) is the single self-report metric most directly associated with greater perceived stress. Poor subjective sleep quality commonly amplifies daily stress reporting even when total sleep time is adequate.  
- The participant’s median sleep start time is relatively late (01:26 AM) and there is a modestly elevated mean daily nap rate (0.18 naps/day; Z = 1.21), both of which correlate weakly in the dataset with higher PSS (nap correlation ~0.15). Late-night timing and use of naps can reflect or contribute to evening arousal, schedule pressure, or compensatory sleep, each of which can increase perceived stress for some people.  
- Evening heart rate elevation is relatively pronounced: aggregate hourly deviation peaks in the early evening (notably 6–7 PM: deviation 27.64, Z = 2.62). Elevated evening cardiovascular activation can reflect sustained arousal or social/behavioral activity late in the day; some hourly deviations (e.g., small positive correlations at early morning hours) also have modest positive correlations with PSS in the study sample.  
- Lower health satisfaction (score 2.67; Z = -1.20) is a personal appraisal that, although weakly correlated with PSS here, can contribute to higher perceived stress when present.

Features that align with lower perceived stress:
- Low symptom burden on mood and anxiety measures: CES-D = 0 (Z = -1.38) and STAI‑Trait = 23 (Z = -1.81) indicate very low recent depressive symptoms and low trait anxiety — both robust indicators typically associated with lower perceived stress.  
- High self‑esteem and self‑reported happiness (RSES Z = 1.66; Happiness Z = 1.64) are protective psychosocial resources that tend to buffer perceived stress.  
- Strong and regular circadian structure: high amplitude (amplitude Z = 1.78), above‑average interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and high 24‑hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.57) indicate a pronounced, consistent rhythm in heart‑rate patterns across days. In this dataset these circadian regularity measures are associated with lower PSS (negative correlations, e.g., amplitude r ≈ -0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11). A consistent rhythm and larger amplitude generally reflect consolidated activity-rest cycles and are linked here to lower perceived stress.  
- Relatively low resting heart rate (54.4 bpm, Z = -0.45) and low night-time heart-rate deviations (large negative deviations overnight) are physiological markers consistent with lower baseline autonomic activation; in the study sample higher resting heart rate modestly correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.14), so this participant’s lower resting rate points away from high perceived stress.  
- Health-promoting behaviors: no reported alcohol or recreational drug use, substantial social time (socializing >4 hours; Z = 2.53), and high academic performance (GPA consistently high) are behavioral markers that tend to associate with lower perceived stress or provide coping resources.

Integration and holistic interpretation:
Most strong indicators in this multimodal profile point toward relatively low perceived stress. The clearest exceptions are subjective sleep disturbance and a late sleep timing with notable evening physiological activation; these elements could elevate daily perceived stress or reflect evening activity patterns that interact with stress perception. However, the participant’s very low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, high self‑esteem/happiness, regular and high‑amplitude circadian rhythm, low resting heart rate, absence of substance use, and stable sleep duration collectively suggest greater resilience and lower stress reactivity than the average study participant. Correlations between individual features and PSS in the sample are generally modest, and several of the participant’s strongest signal magnitudes (e.g., STAI Z = -1.81; CESD Z = -1.38; amplitude Z = 1.78) favor a lower perceived stress interpretation.

Overall comparison to the study population mean PSS:
Considering the balance of evidence, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is most consistent with being below the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.63). The combination of very low depressive and trait anxiety scores, positive affect and self‑esteem, robust circadian regularity, and low resting heart rate make it likely that this individual’s PSS would fall below the sample mean rather than near or above it, although subjective sleep disturbance and late sleep timing represent notable risk factors that could push stress higher in certain contexts.

Limitations and caveats:
This inference synthesizes cross-sectional survey responses and aggregate wearable summaries and relies on modest correlations between features and PSS in the study sample. Single metrics such as PSQI and evening physiological activation point to potential stress-relevant targets, so conclusions are probabilistic rather than definitive."
49497,"Summary of data sources and approach: The following interpretation integrates self-report trait and symptom measures, reported lifestyle behaviors, and wearable-derived sleep and heart-rate/circadian metrics collected across an academic semester. Where available I note standardized (z) scores and the direction/magnitude of correlations with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Correlations reported in the dataset are generally modest in size; I therefore weigh large-magnitude self-report indicators (CES-D, STAI, PSQI) and large z-score deviations more heavily while using wearable circadian and heart-rate features to refine inferences about daily arousal and schedule regularity.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several strong self-report indicators align with elevated perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden is very high (CES-D = 49, z ≈ +3.7) and trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 64, z ≈ +2.2); both measures show positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, z ≈ +1.05) and median nightly sleep duration is modestly short (6 h 30 min, z ≈ -0.85) with very large inconsistency in sleep timing (sleep start SD ≈ 204 min, z ≈ +2.65) and elevated variability of sleep duration (SD ≈ 148 min, z ≈ +1.06); the dataset also shows a positive correlation between sleep-timing variability and PSS (r ≈ 0.17). Recreational and non-prescribed drug use stand out (z-scores very large, especially for non-prescribed drugs), and self-reported happiness and trust are below the study mean (happiness z ≈ -1.61; trust z ≈ -1.42). Several wearable circadian features point to circadian irregularity and fragmentation—low interdaily stability (0.21, z ≈ -1.65), elevated intradaily variability (0.63, z ≈ +0.6), and reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -1.56)—a pattern that is commonly associated with stress, disrupted sleep, and mood disturbance. Taken together, the relative magnitudes of the depressive/anxiety scores, sleep disturbance and timing irregularity, substance use, and circadian disruption form a coherent set of signals that are typically associated with higher perceived stress.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress (or mitigating factors): A small set of measures suggest some behavioral or physiological buffers. Academically the participant’s GPA history is solid (multiple semesters >3.2, some >3.7), which can reflect maintained functioning despite symptom burden. Self-reported physical health satisfaction is modestly above the study mean (z ≈ +0.55). The participant reports regular solo exercise (three times per week or more, z ≈ +1.07), which is typically protective against stress and correlates weakly in the sample with lower PSS. Wearable resting heart rate and MESOR are near the study mean (resting HR ≈ 60.6 bpm, MESOR z ≈ +0.23), without pronounced chronic tachycardia, and daily naps are rare—both of which reduce the likelihood that there is sustained, high autonomic activation across days. Some daytime heart-rate deviations (elevated around mid-morning) suggest consolidated daytime activity rather than pervasive daytime blunting. These factors are relevant but smaller in magnitude compared with the prominent negative indicators listed above.

Physiological/behavioral patterning and probable mechanisms: The wearable-derived pattern—reduced interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability, and lowered amplitude—indicates a circadian rhythm that is less regular and less robust than the sample mean. Practically this is reflected in late and highly variable bedtimes (median start ≈ 01:14 AM; start-time SD large) and variable sleep durations; aggregated heart-rate hour-by-hour deviations show relatively low nocturnal HR and stronger activity-related HR increases in late morning (9–10 AM) and an unusual elevated deviation at 10–11 PM (Z ≈ +1.29), which could reflect intermittent evening activation. These physiological signatures align with the self-reported disturbed sleep and with behaviors (substance use, late sleep timing) that can perpetuate stress and mood symptoms. Correlations between circadian fragmentation metrics and PSS are modest (for example intradaily variability r ≈ +0.16; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11), so these features add convergent evidence but do not by themselves predict extreme PSS.

Balanced conclusion about perceived stress relative to the study sample: Considering the full multimodal profile—very high depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, poor subjective sleep with pronounced irregularity in timing, high levels of recreational/non-prescribed drug use, low self-reported happiness and trust, and wearable indications of circadian disruption—the overall pattern points to a level of perceived stress that is above the study population mean. The strongest contributors to this inference are the high CES-D and STAI scores (both large positive z-scores and positively correlated with PSS) together with sleep disturbance and behavioral risk indicators. Physiological measures present mixed evidence (some buffering via normal resting HR and exercise) but do not offset the magnitude of the self-report risk signals. Therefore the most parsimonious interpretation is that this participant’s perceived stress is above the population mean (population PSS mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), with several markers suggesting the participant may be meaningfully elevated relative to peers.

Uncertainty and caveats: Correlations with PSS in the dataset are generally small-to-moderate, and wearable features are aggregated across days and cannot specify momentary events or causality. Substance-use self-reports and sleep irregularity may both be contributors to higher stress and also coping responses to stress; directionality cannot be inferred here. The inference above privileges high-magnitude, clinically relevant self-report scores together with convergent wearable indicators; additional longitudinal or clinical interview data would reduce uncertainty."
33785,"Summary overview:
The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of clear psychological risk indicators alongside several behavioral and physiological markers that are plausibly protective with respect to perceived stress. Self-report measures show elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 27, Z = +1.42) and trait anxiety (STAI = 56, Z = +1.45), both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (CES-D r = +0.29; STAI r = +0.32). Subjective sleep quality is also mildly disturbed (PSQI = 7), a known correlate of elevated perceived stress. In contrast, wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively regular and robust daily heart-rate rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.48, Z = +0.58; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = +1.06; amplitude Z = +0.54) and low intradaily variability (0.25, Z = −2.08), and the participant reports regular exercise (exercised alone three times/week, Z = +1.07) and reasonable health satisfaction (4.78/7, Z = +0.38). Taken together, the pattern points toward higher perceived stress driven principally by mood and anxiety symptoms, partially offset by regular routines and health behaviors.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Elevated depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety: The CES-D (27; Z = +1.42) and STAI-T (56; Z = +1.45) are both well above the study mean and each correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ +0.29 and +0.32). These are the most salient predictors in the dataset and strongly suggest greater perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep problems: The PSQI of 7 (above the common clinical cut-off of 5; Z = +0.13) indicates poorer subjective sleep quality, which is associated here and elsewhere with higher stress.  
- Small physiological indicators of elevated arousal: Resting heart rate is near the study mean (58.7 bpm, Z = +0.07) and the MESOR is slightly elevated (76.8, Z = +0.39); both show small positive correlations with PSS in this sample (RHR r = +0.14, MESOR r = +0.06), consistent with modestly greater physiological arousal among more stressed participants.  
- Evening/night heart-rate pattern: The aggregated hourly deviations show elevated evening heart-rate deviations (e.g., 10–11 pm deviation = +14.0, Z = +1.19), which may reflect later-day physiological activation that can be linked to stress or behavioral arousal in the evening.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Regular, stable circadian organization: Low intradaily variability (0.25, Z = −2.08) and above-average interdaily regularity/autocorrelation (autocorrelation at 24 h Z = +1.06, interdaily stability Z = +0.58) indicate consistent daily structure and low fragmentation of activity, features that are associated here with lower PSS (interdaily stability r = −0.12; autcorrelation r = −0.17; intradaily variability has a small positive r with PSS). The participant’s median sleep start time is relatively consistent (00:39, SD Z = −0.75), further supporting behavioral regularity.  
- Adequate sleep duration and low nap frequency: Median nightly sleep is within a normative range (7 h 20 min, Z = +0.18) and mean daily naps are minimal (0.07, Z = −0.08), which are not signals typically associated with high perceived stress.  
- Health behaviors and subjective well-being: Regular solitary exercise (three times/week, Z = +1.07), moderate self-reported health satisfaction (4.78/7), and a moderately positive current happiness rating (4/7, Z = +0.55) are all factors that typically buffer perceived stress. Recreational substance use is low. Some leisure activities that correlate negatively with PSS (e.g., reading, video game time) are relatively high, which could reflect coping behaviors that align with lower reported stress in this sample.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean:
Balancing the strong self-reported affective signals (notably elevated CES-D and STAI scores) against the protective behavioral and circadian features, the overall pattern is most consistent with perceived stress above the study population mean. The magnitude of depressive and anxiety scores (both Z ≈ +1.4) are substantive predictors of higher PSS in this cohort and outweigh the modest protective effects of circadian regularity and exercise. In the absence of a direct PSS value for this participant, the convergent evidence suggests an inferred perceived stress level that is above the population mean PSS (study mean = 21.62). This inference is probabilistic: mood and anxiety symptom burden provide the primary basis for an above-mean placement, while stable daily rhythms and regular exercise likely moderate but do not fully offset that elevation.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation limits:
- The hourly heart-rate data are aggregated across days and cannot be used to make date-specific inferences about acute stressors.  
- Correlations provided are sample-level associations and do not establish causality for this individual.  
- The most robust indicators here are the self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms; physiological and behavioral markers should be interpreted as moderating information rather than definitive evidence that perceived stress is high or low.

If helpful, I can produce a brief list of the top three actionable targets (e.g., interventions or monitoring priorities) that align with the features most strongly associated with elevated perceived stress in this profile."
33009,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several wearable-derived circadian features point toward a pattern associated with greater perceived stress. Interdaily stability is low (0.35, Z = -0.49) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (0.27, Z = -0.45), indicating weaker day-to-day regularity of heart rate rhythms; intradaily variability is elevated (0.62, Z = 0.53), indicating greater fragmentation of activity/physiology within days. Amplitude from the cosinor fit is relatively low (7.95, Z = -0.92) and mesor is modestly low (68.76 bpm, Z = -0.71); in this dataset those lower-amplitude and lower-regularity circadian features have correlations with PSS in directions consistent with higher stress (amplitude r ≈ -0.17, intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16, autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17). Subjective sleep quality is also impaired: PSQI = 7 (classified as disturbed sleep), which independently is commonly associated with higher perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 40, classified “anxious”) and reduced self-reported current happiness (3.0, Z = -0.53) further align with elevations in psychological strain. Taken together, the combination of objectively detected circadian fragmentation/flattening and subjective sleep disturbance provides a coherent signal that is commonly seen with increased perceived stress.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Other parts of the profile are protective or inconsistent with high stress. Objective sleep duration is ample and regular: median nightly sleep ~7 h 54 min (Z = 0.89) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 55 minutes, Z = -1.03), and the participant reports essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 9, Z = -0.45, classified “Not depressed”), and self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40, Z = 0.26), both of which are factors that tend to relate to lower reported stress. Resting heart rate is reasonably low and unremarkable (58.1 bpm, Z ≈ -0.01), substance use is limited, social activity is present at moderate levels, and academic performance (GPA history) is strong—each of these behaviors and outcomes typically mitigate perceived stress or its impact.

Integrated interpretation and relative placement versus the study population: The dataset presents a mixed picture with meaningful signals on both sides. Physiological circadian markers and subjective sleep disturbance point toward elevated perceived stress, whereas objective sleep quantity, stable night-to-night sleep duration, low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, and generally healthy behaviors point toward lower perceived stress. Given the balance of evidence—particularly the presence of circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = +0.53), low amplitude (Z = -0.92), reduced interdaily stability/autocorrelation (Z ≈ -0.45) and a PSQI > 5—I infer the participant’s perceived stress is likely modestly elevated relative to the study sample mean. Stated against the sample statistic (population mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the profile is most consistent with a PSS somewhat above the population mean but not extreme (i.e., above the mean within about one SD rather than far outlying).

Clinical/behavioral implications to prioritize: If reducing perceived stress is the objective, the most actionable targets suggested by these data are improving circadian regularity and subjective sleep quality—strengthening daily timing cues (consistent sleep/wake and activity schedules, morning light exposure, limiting evening stimulants/electronic light) may reduce intradaily fragmentation and increase amplitude, and could lower perceived stress. The participant’s good objective sleep duration, high self-esteem, and absence of significant depressive symptoms are strengths to build on when designing behavioral interventions."
96184,"Summary: The available multimodal data indicate a mixed profile in which behavioral and physiological markers of circadian disruption and sleep insufficiency are prominent and point toward elevated perceived stress, while several self-report and behavioral indicators (low depressive symptoms, relatively high self-esteem, low substance use, and sustained academic performance) act as countervailing signals that would be expected to reduce perceived stress. When synthesizing these signals and weighting the most strongly deviant features (notably extreme sleep restriction and sleep-timing irregularity), the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is most consistent with being above the study sample mean PSS score (population mean = 21.61).

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: 
- Sleep quantity and timing show large departures from the sample: median nightly sleep duration is 5 h 27 min (Z = -2.16), and sleep start-time is extremely late (median ~04:42) with very high night-to-night variability (sleep-start SD Z = +7.44; sleep-duration SD Z = +5.88). Both the magnitude and the variability of sleep are among the most extreme values in the sample and are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. 
- Subjective sleep difficulty (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep) is above the clinical cutoff and aligns with the objective sleep deficits. PSQI correlates positively with PSS in the sample, supporting its relevance.
- Circadian and heart-rate rhythm metrics indicate reduced 24-h regularity: interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -1.79), and amplitude is reduced (Z = -1.48). These nonparametric and parametric rhythm disruptions are commonly associated with poorer stress-related regulation.
- Trait anxiety is elevated relative to the scale midpoint (STAI = 42, Z = +0.07) and the STAI has one of the higher positive correlations with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31), suggesting trait anxiety likely contributes to higher perceived stress.
- Several wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations during early-morning hours (e.g., 2–7 AM) show relatively large negative deviations from the mesor and modest positive correlations with PSS (some hourly correlations up to ~0.21). In context with short sleep, these patterns are consistent with fragmented/irregular sleep and physiological stress-related dysregulation.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55; classified as not depressed). The CES-D correlates positively with PSS, so a low CES-D score argues for lower perceived stress relative to someone with higher depressive symptoms.
- Self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg score = 40, Z = +0.26), and self-esteem correlates negatively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ -0.15), which would be protective against high perceived stress.
- Health-related behaviors and risk factors that often increase stress are minimal: almost no reported alcohol or recreational drug use (Z-scores strongly negative), and BMI is in the normal range (19.13). These low-risk lifestyle indicators favor lower perceived stress.
- Academic performance (GPA ~3.5–3.6 across semesters) is strong, which can reflect competence or resources that may buffer perceived stress.
- Resting heart rate is somewhat low (55.5 bpm, Z = -0.32), a physiological characteristic that does not point toward sympathetic overactivation in resting conditions and thus does not by itself signal high perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the sample mean:
- Weighting the evidence toward the most deviant and theoretically relevant signals (extremely short and inconsistent sleep, marked sleep timing irregularity, and disrupted circadian metrics) suggests that the participant’s perceived stress is likely higher than the study population mean (i.e., above 21.61). The combination of severe sleep restriction/irregularity and modestly elevated trait anxiety—both of which correlate positively with PSS—are the principal drivers of this inference.
- Protective factors (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, minimal substance use, and preserved academic functioning) moderate the inference and argue that perceived stress is not necessarily extreme, but the magnitude of the sleep- and rhythm-related deviations makes “above the population mean” the most consistent categorization.

Limitations and uncertainty:
- This inference is based on cross-sectional/aggregated associations and correlations in the dataset rather than a direct PSS score for this participant. Correlations do not establish causality, and some individual signals (e.g., low resting HR, high GPA) may reflect resilience or compensatory mechanisms.
- Wearable-derived metrics are aggregated across days and do not provide context for situational stressors (exams, deadlines). The strong night-to-night variability in sleep suggests that stress may be episodic and tied to specific demands, but that cannot be determined precisely from the aggregated data.
- Given these limitations, the conclusion is probabilistic: the participant most plausibly exhibits perceived stress above the study mean, driven principally by severe sleep insufficiency and circadian irregularity, with mitigating influences from low depressive symptoms and other protective behavioral features."
79395,"Summary: The participant’s data show a mixed profile with clear signals of psychological distress on self-report measures alongside physiological and behavioral patterns that are, in several respects, relatively well-regulated. Self-report indices most strongly suggest elevated perceived stress: a high depressive symptom score (CES-D = 32; z ≈ +1.95) and an elevated trait-anxiety score (STAI = 54; z ≈ +1.25). Low self-esteem (RSES = 25; z ≈ −1.85) and low current happiness (score = 2.0; z ≈ −1.61) further indicate negative affect and self-evaluation. The PSQI score of 6 (just above the typical cutpoint) denotes subjectively disturbed sleep. Taken together—especially given positive correlations of CES-D and STAI with PSS in the sample—these survey markers point toward higher perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: the strong elevations on depressive and anxiety measures are the most salient indicators that the participant is likely experiencing greater perceived stress than typical study participants (both scales show positive correlations with PSS in the sample: CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32). Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) and low self-rated happiness and health satisfaction also align with higher PSS. Behavioral patterns that may reflect stress-related functioning include a late habitual sleep onset (median sleep start ~01:21 AM) and marked evening cardiovascular elevation (notable positive deviations from mesor during the 9–11 PM hours, with particularly large z-scores at 9–11 PM), which together suggest elevated evening physiological arousal or late-night activity that can coincide with increased perceived stress. Alcohol use at the level reported (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; z ≈ +1.0) is slightly above average for this sample and, while not strongly correlated with PSS here, can be associated with coping-related use in higher-stress contexts.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress or resilience: objective wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate strong day-to-day regularity and structure—interdaily stability = 0.55 (z ≈ +1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 h (z ≈ +1.15)—which are typically associated with more stable routines and lower stress vulnerability (sample correlations here are small-to-moderate and in the expected directions). Intradaily variability is lower than average (z ≈ −0.53), indicating less fragmentation of activity across the day; resting heart rate is modestly below the study mean (56.7 bpm; z ≈ −0.17). Sleep quantity and consistency also show protective features: median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 15 m (z ≈ +0.09) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 88 min, z ≈ −0.29) and a small variance in sleep start time (SD ≈ 47 min, z ≈ −0.80). Behavioral supports that may mitigate perceived stress include frequent group exercise (exercising with others three+ times/week; z ≈ +1.23) and low rates of recreational or non-prescribed drug use. These objective and behavioral features represent plausible buffers against stress despite the elevated subjective distress.

Integrated interpretation and position relative to the study sample: weighing the evidence, the self-report indices that most directly predict perceived stress (notably CES-D and STAI) are markedly elevated and carry substantial weight in inferring PSS. Objective wearables show a well-structured circadian pattern, adequate and consistent sleep duration, low resting heart rate, and regular activity that likely reduce physiological vulnerability to stress. On balance, the data indicate a participant whose perceived stress is most plausibly above the population mean PSS for this sample, driven primarily by elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and reduced subjective well-being, with some physiological and behavioral resilience factors that may moderate the degree or consequences of that stress. Therefore, relative to the study mean PSS (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the participant’s profile is best characterized as above the population mean.

Implications for interpretation: the divergence between strong subjective distress and relatively organized physiological rhythms suggests the participant is experiencing substantial negative mood and anxiety that are not fully reflected in gross circadian dysregulation or poor sleep quantity. The late but consistent sleep schedule and elevated evening heart rate suggest evening arousal or activity may be a useful target for interventions or monitoring (e.g., strategies to reduce late-night arousal, improve subjective sleep quality, or address mood/anxiety symptoms). Continued multimodal monitoring (self-report plus wearables) would help clarify whether the objective resilience markers buffer functional impairment and whether targeted behavioral changes reduce perceived stress over time."
59863,"Summary and overall comparison: Integrating self-report, behavioral, and wearable-derived physiological data yields a profile that, on balance, is most consistent with a perceived stress level below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62). Multiple self-report indicators of mood and trait vulnerability to stress (CES-D = 5, z = −0.86; STAI-Trait = 24, z = −1.71) are well below sample averages, and positive psychosocial indicators (Rosenberg self-esteem z = +1.66; current happiness z = +1.64; health satisfaction z = +1.3) point toward relatively low subjective distress. Sleep quantity and quality are also near or better than the study mean (median sleep 7 h 24 m, z = +0.27; PSQI = 5, z = −0.8), and the participant reports regular physical activity and limited substance use — all factors that typically align with lower perceived stress. Given the relative magnitude and consistency of these psychological and behavioral signals, the inferred perceived stress level is below the population mean.

Indices and patterns that point toward relatively higher perceived stress: there are some physiological markers that could reflect elevated autonomic arousal. Resting heart rate is higher than the study average (RHR = 67.65 bpm, z = +1.13) and the heart rate mesor is markedly elevated (MESOR = 91.26, z = +2.36). Both of those metrics show small positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (RHR correlation ≈ +0.14; mesor correlation ≈ +0.07), suggesting that elevated cardiac tone could be associated with greater perceived stress in this sample. The cosinor amplitude is also above average (z ≈ +1.01), indicating larger day–night differences in heart rate; depending on context, a higher mesor combined with higher amplitude can reflect tonic elevation of cardiovascular activation rather than purely healthy fitness effects. A few hourly heart-rate deviations (early-morning and some daytime hours) show small positive correlations with PSS, which is consistent with the possibility of modest physiological arousal that is not fully concordant with self-reported low distress.

Indices and patterns that point toward relatively lower perceived stress: multiple domains converge on low subjective stress vulnerability. Depression and trait anxiety scores are well below the sample mean, and positive self-evaluations (high self-esteem, high reported happiness, good perceived health) are robust signals that typically accompany lower perceived stress (many of these measures have small negative correlations with PSS in the dataset). Behavioral patterns that protect against stress are prominent: frequent exercise (exercising alone three+ times/week, z ≈ +1.07), limited alcohol and no reported drug use, stable sleep timing (median start ~00:38, moderate variability) and low nap frequency (0.0, z = −0.86), and circadian metrics that indicate regularity — interdaily stability slightly above average (z ≈ +0.42), low intradaily variability (z ≈ −1.16), and reasonable 24-h autocorrelation (z ≈ +0.64). These circadian/wearable patterns generally have negative correlations with PSS in the study and therefore support a lower perceived stress inference.

Integrated interpretation and caveats: the most salient pattern is a strong and consistent set of psychological and behavioral protective factors (very low depression and trait anxiety, high self-esteem and happiness, regular sleep and exercise, limited substance use) that point toward perceived stress below the study mean. Physiological data introduce a countervailing signal — notably an elevated mesor and somewhat elevated resting heart rate — which could reflect mild sustained autonomic activation that is not reflected in self-report. Because the physiological deviations (z-scores and correlations) are moderate and not large in magnitude, they do not override the robust self-report and behavioral evidence; rather, they suggest either (a) subclinical or context-specific physiological arousal unrelated to current subjective distress, (b) fitness or metabolic factors influencing heart rate, or (c) a potential early-warning sign that would merit monitoring over time if concern about increasing stress arises. Limitations to note: cosinor and aggregated hourly heart-rate data are temporally summarized and cannot resolve transient stressors or day-to-day fluctuations; correlations with PSS in the dataset are generally small, so inferences about causality or magnitude should be cautious.

Bottom line: considering the full multimodal dataset, the participant’s profile most consistently aligns with perceived stress below the study sample mean (i.e., lower-than-average PSS), while showing some modest physiological markers of elevated cardiac tone that warrant contextual interpretation and potential follow-up if other indicators change."
22913,"Overview: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of behavioral and physiological signals but, on balance, more features point toward lower perceived stress than higher. Key objective markers include a long median nocturnal sleep duration (8 h 37 min; z = +1.79), a relatively regular circadian pattern (intradaily variability z = -1.8; interdaily stability z = 0.0) and a pronounced heart-rate amplitude (amplitude z = +0.84) with a clear daytime peak (acrophase 4:49 PM). Self-report measures of affective symptom burden and trait vulnerability to stress are low: CES-D = 0 (z = -1.38) and STAI–Trait = 34 (z = -0.72). Subjective sleep quality is at or slightly better than sample average (PSQI = 5; z = -0.8). These elements together suggest relatively preserved sleep, low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a structured day–night physiology—factors typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively low perceived stress: The absence of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0) and below-average trait anxiety (STAI z ≈ -0.7) are strong psychological indicators that the participant is not experiencing high chronic affective distress. Objective sleep is both long and reasonably consistent (median duration 8h37m, SD of sleep start ~83 minutes, few naps), and sleep quality by PSQI is at the “good”/borderline threshold (z = -0.8); better sleep generally corresponds to lower perceived stress. Circadian measures support behavioral regularity: notably low intradaily variability (z = -1.8) and a substantial circadian amplitude (z = +0.84), both patterns that are commonly associated with more stable daily functioning and lower stress in population studies (amplitude correlation with PSS ≈ -0.16). Low scores on depressive and anxiety screens, together with preserved sleep and circadian regularity, weigh strongly toward lower-than-average perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively high perceived stress: A few physiological and lifestyle features point in the opposite direction, though their associations with perceived stress are modest. Resting heart rate (64.6 bpm; z = +0.77) and a relatively high mesor of hourly-aggregated heart rate (mesor = 87.24; z = +1.81) indicate a higher baseline cardiovascular level, and both metrics show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (resting HR r ≈ +0.14). Lifestyle measures that could increase stress vulnerability include low physical activity (exercise reported 1–2 times a month; sports “not at all”; exercise z-scores negative) and a greater-than-average frequency of alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2 times/week; z ≈ +1.0). Self-reported current happiness is below the sample mean (z ≈ -0.53), which—given its small negative correlation with PSS—could reflect or contribute to higher perceived stress. Overall, these upward cues are present but smaller in magnitude and have weaker correlations with PSS than the stronger downward cues listed above.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Integrating survey, behavioral, and physiological data, the participant’s profile is most consistent with perceived stress that is below the population mean PSS score. The strongest evidence for a below-mean PSS is the absence of depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 0), below-average trait anxiety, good/long objective sleep, and well-structured circadian rhythms—features that, in this sample, are more predictive and larger in effect size than the modestly elevated resting HR/mesor and sedentary lifestyle indicators. Stated relative to the sample mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), the participant’s pattern suggests perceived stress “below the population mean,” though not extremely low; several small physiological and behavioral risk signals temper confidence that stress is very low.

Confidence and limitations: The inference above balances multiple sources but should be treated as probabilistic. Many of the correlations between individual metrics and PSS in this dataset are small (often |r| < 0.20), so single markers (e.g., mesor or alcohol use) carry limited predictive weight. Wearable-derived heart-rate elevations may reflect fitness, transient factors, or measurement bias rather than chronic stress. Self-report measures here were collected at a single time point; they reflect recent or trait states rather than continuous stress exposure. In summary, the preponderance of evidence favors a perceived stress level below the study sample mean, but modest contradictory signals and small effect sizes reduce certainty."
48969,"Summary of signals consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
The participant’s self-report profile contains several robust indicators that typically accompany elevated perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden is very high (CES-D = 42; Z = 2.99), and trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 59; Z = 1.75); both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in the study sample and are strongly suggestive of greater subjective stress. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 13; Z = 2.9), which often amplifies perceived stress and is commonly comorbid with mood and anxiety symptoms. Objective physiology also points toward greater autonomic arousal: resting heart rate is above the study mean (68.6 bpm; Z = 1.24), and several nighttime hourly heart-rate deviations show less pronounced nocturnal suppression than would be expected for a low-stress profile, consistent with elevated overnight arousal. Behavioral features that are plausibly stress-related include very low in-person socializing (≈15 minutes or less; Z = -2.20) and extensive sedentary screen-based leisure (TV/videos and video games both extreme positive Z-scores), patterns that are often associated with rumination, withdrawal, and reduced social buffering of stress.

Summary of signals consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
There are also several features that temper the interpretation of uniformly high perceived stress. Wearable-derived sleep duration is adequate on average (median sleep ≈7 h 51 min; Z = 0.84) and the participant reports essentially no daytime napping (Z = -0.86), which reduces one common source of daytime dysfunction. Circadian-structure metrics show some regularity: autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (0.44; Z = 0.98), and interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.40; Z ≈ -0.08), indicating a consistent day-to-day rhythm that can be protective for mood and stress regulation. The participant reports exercising alone three or more times per week (Z = 1.07), a behavioral factor often linked to lowered physiological and perceived stress. Substance use is minimal, and low alcohol/drug use removes a common exacerbating factor for stress and mood symptoms.

Integration and interpretation:
Balancing these streams of evidence, the profile indicates a mixed but overall concerning pattern: strong, convergent self-report indicators of elevated distress (high depression and trait anxiety scores, low self‑esteem) and objective signs of increased arousal (elevated resting HR and some blunting of nocturnal heart-rate decline) argue for higher perceived stress. Protective or non-elevating signals (adequate total sleep time, regular circadian timing, frequent exercise, minimal substance use) reduce the likelihood of the most extreme stress states but do not offset the magnitude of the affective symptomatology. The circadian amplitude is somewhat lower than average (amplitude Z ≈ -0.38), which, together with the very high PSQI, suggests that subjective sleep quality and rhythm robustness are not fully restorative despite sufficient sleep duration.

Comparison to the study population mean:
Taking the full multimodal profile into account, the participant’s overall perceived stress level is best characterized as above the population mean PSS score (study mean = 21.61). This conclusion is driven primarily by large elevations on depressive and anxiety scales (both of which correlate positively with PSS in the sample), elevated resting heart rate, and marked social withdrawal and high sedentary leisure time—factors that, in aggregate, are more typical of participants with PSS scores above the sample mean.

Caveats:
This is an inference from cross-sectional self-report and aggregated wearable data rather than a direct PSS score for the participant; correlations reported in the dataset are moderate and do not establish causation. Wearable-derived metrics are aggregated across days and cannot capture acute day-to-day spikes in stress. These limitations suggest cautious interpretation and, if clinical or programmatic decisions are being considered, direct assessment with the PSS and/or clinical interview would be advisable."
79731,"Summary statement
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant shows a pattern more consistent with elevated perceived stress than with low stress. High scores on trait anxiety and depressive symptom scales, poor subjective sleep quality, physiological indicators of increased autonomic arousal (elevated resting heart rate and elevated mesor), and markers of circadian instability/fragmentation each point toward greater stress burden. When considered against the study sample mean PSS of 21.61 (SD = 3.68), the overall constellation of data is best characterized as above the population mean for perceived stress.

Evidence indicating relatively higher perceived stress
Several self-report indices strongly favor an interpretation of elevated stress: the STAI–Trait score of 60 (Z = 1.85) and the CES-D score of 27 (Z = 1.42) indicate high trait anxiety and elevated depressive symptoms; both of these measures also show moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31 and 0.28 respectively). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11, Z = 1.98), which commonly co-occurs with and amplifies perceived stress. Wearable physiology aligns with these self-report signals: resting heart rate is elevated (71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55) and the mesor is above average (79.9, Z = 0.81), consistent with higher baseline cardiovascular activation. Circadian metrics show a blunted amplitude (Amplitude = 7.09, Z = -1.19) and reduced interdaily stability (0.34, Z = -0.57) together with increased intradaily variability (0.64, Z = 0.67). This combination—dampened day–night rhythmic amplitude and increased within-day fragmentation—has been associated in prior work with poorer stress regulation and higher perceived stress; intradaily variability here also shows a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16). Nighttime behavior is notable: the median sleep start time is very late (≈ 02:58 AM) and sleep duration, while long on average, is highly variable (SD ≈ 177 minutes, Z = 1.73). Large night-to-night sleep variability and delayed sleep timing are both linked with elevated perceived stress and mood symptoms. Together, elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep, physiological signs of increased autonomic tone, and circadian instability constitute convergent evidence for above-average perceived stress.

Evidence indicating relatively lower perceived stress or potential buffers
There are some features that temper the interpretation of uniformly severe stress. The participant reports some momentary positive affect (reported happiness score of 4.0, Z ≈ 0.55), and substance use is low to moderate (alcohol use 1–2 times/month, no recreational or non-prescribed drugs), which reduce confounds from substance-related stress. Time spent socializing (1–2 hours) is near sample average and may serve as a modest social buffer. High total median sleep duration (8 h 17 min, Z = 1.37) could be restorative in principle (longer sleep can sometimes protect against immediate fatigue), although here it co-occurs with poor subjective sleep quality and high variability—so any protective effect is likely limited. Some behavioral factors that are typically stress-protective (regular exercise, consistent daily schedules, and frequent social/physical activity) are absent or low for this participant (exercise “not at all,” low interdaily stability), which reduces the strength of potential buffering effects.

Integrated interpretation and relative placement vs. the sample mean
Balancing all modalities, the preponderance of evidence points to elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. High trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores, poor subjective sleep quality, elevated resting heart rate and mesor, and objective circadian disruption/fragmentation are the most salient and mutually reinforcing indicators of elevated stress. While some behavioral factors (limited substance use, modest social time, and long average sleep duration) could mitigate stress to a degree, they are outweighed by the magnitude of the anxiety/depression scores and the physiological/circadian signals. Therefore, the participant’s overall perceived stress is best described as above the population mean PSS score (sample mean = 21.61). The multimodal profile suggests a clinically meaningful cluster of increased stress-related symptomatology and physiological arousal that would merit monitoring and, if appropriate for the study context, follow-up assessment or targeted interventions addressing sleep timing/regularity, anxiety symptoms, and circadian stabilization."
64296,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively low perceived stress:
Multiple self-report measures point toward lower-than-average psychological distress. The participant’s depressive symptom score on the CES‑D is very low (score = 3, Z = -1.07) and trait anxiety on the STAI is below the sample mean (score = 35, Z = -0.62); both of these scales correlate positively with PSS in the study, so these low scores favor lower perceived stress. High self‑esteem (Rosenberg Z ≈ 0.96) and elevated momentary happiness (current = 5, Z = 1.64) also align with lower PSS (self‑esteem has a small negative correlation with PSS). Wearable-derived circadian metrics further support a lower-stress profile: interdaily stability (0.58, Z = 1.41) and 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.48, Z = 1.32) indicate a regular, stable day‑to‑day rhythm, and a large heart‑rate amplitude (19.12, Z = 2.7) suggests robust diurnal variation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (49.8 bpm, Z = -0.99), which physiologically tends to reflect lower baseline sympathetic activation. Taken together, psychological self‑reports and the pattern of strong, regular circadian physiology provide convergent evidence favoring a perceived stress level below the study population mean.

Evidence that could indicate relatively higher perceived stress (or raise caution):
There are a small number of features that could be interpreted as stress‑related risk factors. Median nightly sleep duration is somewhat short (6 h 52 min, Z = -0.4) and the participant’s habitual sleep onset is late (median start ≈ 01:07), which can, in some contexts, be associated with greater perceived stress or reduced recovery. The participant reports minimal solo exercise and relatively little socializing (social time 16–30 minutes, substantial negative Z), which—if persistent—can limit typical behavioral buffers against stress. These behavioral indicators are modest in magnitude and their correlations with PSS in this sample are small; they therefore suggest caution but do not by themselves provide strong evidence of elevated perceived stress.

Physiological detail and its interpretation:
The participant’s aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines (large negative deviations across roughly 1–7 AM with Zs often < -1.7) and pronounced daytime peaks, particularly in the mid‑ to late‑afternoon (e.g., 4–5 PM deviation Z = 2.14). The acrophase at ~4:23 PM and the large amplitude are consistent with a well‑entrained circadian pattern of rest and activity. Non‑parametric circadian measures (high interdaily stability, moderate intradaily variability) indicate a structured daily routine rather than chaotic timing. These physiological features are typically associated with better autonomic regulation and, in this dataset, trend toward lower PSS; the correlations between these metrics and PSS are modest but in the expected direction (e.g., amplitude correlation ≈ -0.16, interdaily stability ≈ -0.11).

Weighing the evidence and overall inference relative to the study sample:
Balancing self‑report and wearable data, the preponderance of evidence points toward lower perceived stress compared with the study sample. Psychological trait scores (low CES‑D and STAI, high self‑esteem and happiness), robust and regular heart‑rate circadian structure (high interdaily stability, large amplitude), and a relatively low resting heart rate provide multiple, convergent indicators of lower PSS. Behavioral cautionary signs (slightly short and late sleep, limited solo exercise and minimal social time) are present but modest and not strongly weighted by the available correlations. On balance, the participant’s overall perceived stress level is best characterized as below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). This conclusion reflects converging low‑distress self‑reports and well‑entrained physiological rhythms rather than any single metric.

Limitations and interpretive cautions:
Correlations between individual features and PSS in this study are generally small, so no single indicator provides definitive evidence. Some wearable correlations are counterintuitive or weak, and self‑report scales capture distinct constructs (momentary happiness vs. trait anxiety vs. depressive symptoms). The inference above should therefore be treated as probabilistic: the participant most likely reports perceived stress below the study mean, but modest risk factors (late/short sleep, limited exercise/social time) could change that profile under different circumstances (e.g., periods of acute academic pressure)."
17569,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of protective and risk-related indicators for perceived stress. Trait and symptom questionnaires (CES-D = 11; STAI-trait = 38) are in the non-clinical range and self-esteem and health-satisfaction scores are above the study mean, whereas subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8) and objectively short sleep duration (median 5 h 44 m, Z = -1.81) are notable concerns. Wearable-derived circadian measures show relatively high interdaily stability (0.55, Z = 1.16) and a pronounced circadian amplitude (13.6, Z = 0.91) alongside low resting heart rate (47 bpm, Z = -1.33). Taken together, the pattern is mixed but tilts modestly toward lower perceived stress compared with the study sample average.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: • Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8, classified as disturbed sleep) and objectively short nightly sleep duration (median 5 h 44 m, Z = -1.81) are both factors commonly associated with greater perceived stress; these features are salient and have direct relevance to daily functioning. • Intradaily variability in heart rate is elevated (0.61, Z = 0.46) and its correlation with PSS in this sample is positive (r ≈ 0.16), which suggests some fragmentation or irregularity of activity/rest within days that has been associated with higher stress in this cohort. • The participant reports lower current happiness (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53), which correlates negatively with PSS in the study and therefore aligns with greater perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: • Trait mood and anxiety indicators are generally favorable: CES-D (11) and STAI-trait (38) are both below the sample mean (Z-scores -0.24 and -0.33 respectively), indicating limited depressive symptoms and lower trait anxiety — features that typically predict lower PSS. • Self-esteem and health satisfaction are above the study mean (SelfEsteem Z = 0.68; Health Satisfaction Z = 1.13), and trust in others is relatively high (Z = 1.15); these psychosocial resources are associated with reduced perceived stress. • Circadian regularity is a clear strength: interdaily stability is high (Z = 1.16) and the cosinor amplitude is relatively large (Z = 0.91). Both interdaily stability and amplitude correlate negatively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ -0.12 and r ≈ -0.17 respectively), consistent with more robust daily rhythmicity and lower stress. • Objective physiology also points to lower arousal at rest: resting heart rate is low (47 bpm, Z = -1.33), which tends to track with better cardiovascular fitness and in this dataset is weakly associated with lower perceived stress.

Circadian and hourly heart-rate pattern interpretation: The hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal declines in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and clear daytime elevations, with peak deviations in mid-morning and early evening (notably 9–10 AM and 6–7 PM). The acrophase at ~4:14 PM and the large amplitude indicate a well-structured and relatively strong circadian rhythm. Because interdaily stability is elevated and nocturnal heart-rate suppression is robust, the wearable-derived circadian profile supports consistent daily structure — a factor inversely related to PSS in this sample. At the same time, some intraday variability suggests occasional within-day fragmentation (e.g., more variable heart-rate patterns during wake hours), which could correspond to episodic stressors or irregular activity patterns.

Holistic conclusion regarding perceived stress relative to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, protective psychosocial resources (lower trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction), robust circadian regularity, and low resting heart rate weigh more heavily than the risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, short sleep duration, modest intradaily variability, and reduced current happiness). Therefore, the overall pattern is most consistent with perceived stress near to or slightly below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68). In other words, the participant’s inferred PSS is likely not elevated relative to the sample average and is probably within one standard deviation below or close to the mean rather than substantially above it.

Key caveats: Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in this cohort are generally small-to-moderate, so no single metric is determinative. The strongest stress-relevant signals here are the poor subjective and objective sleep quantities (which can elevate perceived stress) versus the strong circadian regularity and positive psychosocial profile (which mitigate perceived stress). Interpretations would be strengthened by the participant’s actual PSS score, repeated subjective stress reports, and context about academic workload or temporally specific stressors."
77036,"Summary statement
The multimodal profile presents a mix of signals. Objective circadian and heart-rate structure are relatively robust (notably high interdaily stability and very strong 24-hour autocorrelation), subjective mood and affect are generally positive (moderate self-reported happiness, low depressive symptoms), and health behaviors show low substance use and some weekly sport participation. Countervailing indicators include self-reported disturbed sleep (PSQI = 6), a modestly elevated trait-anxiety score (STAI = 43), and limited daily social/recreational engagement. Taking all sources into account, the pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level near the study sample mean — with a modest tendency toward being slightly below the population mean PSS rather than substantially above it. (Population PSS mean = 21.61; this inference is based on integrating trait anxiety, sleep complaints, physiological arousal markers, and strong circadian regularity.)

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher perceived stress
Several measures support the possibility of elevated perceived stress. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is 6 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating subjective sleep problems despite objectively regular sleep timing; poor subjective sleep quality is correlated with higher PSS in the sample. Trait anxiety is above the sample average (STAI = 43, z ≈ 0.17) and STAI correlates positively with PSS in this cohort, which is a known contributor to higher perceived stress. Resting heart rate is modestly above average (61.2 bpm, z = 0.36) and shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample, consistent with slightly higher physiological arousal. Finally, the participant reports minimal daily social time and many “do not do” responses for leisure activities (socializing z ≈ -1.41; multiple sedentary/recreational activities with large negative z-scores), which could reduce buffering resources and is a contextual factor that can support higher perceived stress.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress
Several objective and self-report features indicate lower perceived stress risk. Circadian rhythm metrics from heart rate are notably regular: interdaily stability is elevated (value = 0.53, z = 1.00) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is very high (0.62, z = 2.49); both of these metrics correlate negatively with PSS in the sample, implying that strong day-to-day regularity in physiology is linked to lower perceived stress. Intradaily variability is low (0.36, z = -1.31), indicating limited fragmentation of rhythms, which is also consistent with lower stress. Self-reported depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 8, z = -0.55), self-esteem is near the sample mean (RSES = 38), and current happiness is above average (happiness z ≈ 0.55) — all factors that typically associate with lower PSS. Health behaviors that are protective include very low substance use and participation in sports 1–2 times per week (sports z ≈ 0.91), which may support resilience.

Sleep and circadian physiology: reconciliation of objective versus subjective sleep
Wearable sleep metrics show a fairly consistent sleep schedule (median start ~00:47, sleep start SD ≈ 58 minutes, sleep-duration SD ≈ 67 minutes) and median nightly duration of ~6 h 51 m (z ≈ -0.41). Those objective markers suggest reasonably regular sleep timing but slightly short sleep on average. In contrast, the PSQI indicates subjective disturbance. This discordance is important: objective circadian regularity (strong interdaily stability and autocorrelation) is protective for perceived stress, but the participant’s subjective experience of poor sleep quality may still contribute to higher perceived stress via distress about sleep or non-restorative sleep. The evening acrophase (~4:14 PM) and typical daytime heart-rate elevations are within expected patterns and do not by themselves indicate dysregulated circadian timing.

Daily heart-rate profile and physiology
The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal nadir (early-morning deviations down to ~-21 bpm relative to the mesor) and daytime elevations of ~+8–11 bpm in the late afternoon — a classic diurnal pattern. MESOR (78.5 bpm) and amplitude are near-sample average, and the clear 24-hour structure (especially autocorrelation z = 2.49) indicates stable cardiovascular rhythmicity. These physiological hallmarks align with lower perceived stress in the sample (negative correlations between circadian regularity measures and PSS) and argue against pervasive sympathetic hyperarousal across days.

Behavioral and psychosocial context
The participant reports limited alcohol, no recreational/non-prescribed drug use, and only occasional solitary exercise but participates in sports 1–2 times weekly. Academic performance (GPA ~3.0–3.2 across terms) is within a moderate range. Self-rated health satisfaction is somewhat below average (z ≈ -0.53), and social/recreational engagement is low — factors that can reduce coping resources and modestly elevate perceived stress. The combination of low depressive symptoms and above-average happiness suggests relatively preserved positive affect, which mitigates stress vulnerability.

Integrated conclusion about perceived stress relative to the study population
Balancing the evidence — subjective sleep disturbance and modest trait anxiety that push toward higher perceived stress versus strong, objective circadian stability, low depressive symptoms, low substance use, and above-average happiness that push toward lower perceived stress — the overall profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level near the study sample mean, with a modest lean toward being slightly below the population mean PSS rather than clearly above it. In plain terms: this participant does not present the strongest set of indicators for high PSS in the cohort, but there are meaningful risk signals (subjective sleep problems, some trait anxiety, limited social/leisure engagement) that could elevate perceived stress and merit monitoring.

Key caveats
This inference integrates cross-sectional trait measures, subjective reports, and aggregated wearable summaries rather than a direct PSS score for the participant. Correlations provided in the dataset are modest in magnitude and do not imply determinism for an individual. The most actionable uncertainty stems from the mismatch between objective stability and subjective sleep complaints; resolving that discrepancy would materially refine the stress estimate."
82986,"Summary: The participant’s dataset shows a mixed profile. Self-report measures of mood, trait anxiety, and self-regard are on the favorable side of the study distribution (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and happiness), whereas wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics point to short sleep duration, late and irregular sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude, and a modestly elevated resting heart rate. These objective markers are consistent with physiological strain or circadian disruption even when subjective mood measures are relatively positive. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress level is likely not markedly elevated relative to the study sample; a conservative inference is that perceived stress is near to slightly below the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.62). This conclusion is qualified by the presence of objective signals associated with physiological stress and disrupted sleep that could increase perceived strain over time.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Sleep quantity and timing: Median nightly sleep is 5 hours 6 minutes (Z = -2.6), and the median sleep start time is late (02:24). The PSQI score is 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”), indicating subjectively poorer sleep. Short, late, and disturbed sleep are well-established contributors to increased stress burden and may amplify daily perceived stress even when mood ratings are low.
- Circadian fragmentation and reduced amplitude: Interdaily stability is below average (0.33, Z = -0.66) and intradaily variability is modestly higher than average (0.61, Z = 0.46). Cosinor-derived amplitude is reduced (7.55, Z = -1.04) while MESOR is elevated (79.73, Z = 0.79). Reduced amplitude and lower day‑to‑day stability indicate a less-robust circadian pattern and greater rhythm fragmentation—features linked to higher stress and poorer recovery.
- Elevated resting cardiovascular tone: Resting heart rate is relatively high for the sample (66.8 bpm, Z = 1.03). Higher resting heart rate and some daytime elevations in aggregate heart-rate deviations are modestly associated with higher PSS in the study (resting HR correlation with PSS ≈ 0.14). These physiological signals point toward increased autonomic arousal or reduced recovery.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 4 (Z ≈ -0.97) and STAI-Trait = 25 (Z ≈ -1.61) are both well below the sample mean, indicating low current depressive symptoms and low trait anxiety—strongly protective for lower perceived stress (CES‑D and STAI show positive correlations with PSS in the sample).
- Positive psychosocial indicators: Self‑esteem (Rosenberg) is high (Z = 1.66), self-reported happiness is high (Z = 1.64), and trust scores are elevated (Z = 1.79). These social and self‑evaluative resources are negatively correlated or uncorrelated with PSS in the sample and generally predict lower perceived stress or greater resilience to stressors.
- Low behavioral risk: The participant reports essentially no recreational substance use and only moderate solitary exercise (1–2 times/week). Absence of substance use and some physical activity reduce behavioral contributors to perceived stress in this dataset.

Integrated interpretation and uncertainty
- The most salient conflict in the profile is the divergence between subjective self-reports (low distress/high positive resources) and objective physiology/behavior (markedly short sleep, late timing, circadian irregularity, and elevated resting HR). Perceived stress (PSS) is a subjective construct, so the participant’s low symptom reporting and high self‑esteem/happiness point toward a PSS at or below the study mean. However, the objective signals—especially the combination of very short sleep (Z = -2.6) plus circadian fragmentation and higher resting HR—represent physiological risk factors that often accompany or precede increases in perceived stress. Correlations between many wearable metrics and PSS in this sample are modest, so the physiological indicators increase concern but do not deterministically imply high perceived stress.
- Practical interpretation: at the time of measurement the participant appears to experience relatively low self-reported emotional distress and resources that tend to buffer perceived stress, so their inferred PSS is likely near or slightly below the population mean (i.e., not substantially above 21.62). That said, the objective pattern of sleep deprivation, late timing, and circadian irregularity constitutes an area of concern for future or situational increases in perceived stress and physiologic strain if those patterns persist.

Comparison to the study population mean PSS
- Based on the combination of strong subjective indicators of low distress and the countervailing objective signs of physiological strain, the best-supported inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near to slightly below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). This judgment carries uncertainty: objective wearable metrics suggest elevated physiological stress exposure that could raise perceived stress over time, while self-report measures indicate current low perceived stress."
11402,"Summary: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a mixed but coherent picture in which trait-level anxiety and some objective physiological indicators point toward elevated perceived stress, while several behavioral and subjective sleep measures point in the opposite direction. On balance—given the relatively large positive associations between trait anxiety/depressive symptoms and PSS in the study sample and this participant’s elevated scores on those instruments—the participant’s inferred perceived stress is most consistent with being above the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). Below I describe the specific signals that support higher versus lower perceived stress and then synthesize them into a contextualized conclusion.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait) is elevated (score = 54, Z = 1.25) and this measure is positively correlated with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.31). High trait anxiety is one of the strongest survey-based predictors of higher perceived stress in the dataset.  
- Depressive symptom burden is modestly elevated (CES-D = 17, Z = 0.38), and CES-D is positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.28). The co-occurrence of elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms increases the likelihood of above-average perceived stress.  
- Wearable-derived indicators of circadian timing and sleep regularity point toward stress-related risk: the participant’s median sleep start time is very late (about 03:17), with high night-to-night variability (sleep-start SD ≈ 135 minutes, Z ≈ 1.14). Sleep-timing irregularity in this sample is positively associated with PSS (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.17), so the late and irregular timing is a risk factor.  
- Some physiological markers are elevated relative to the cohort: resting heart rate (63.4 bpm, Z = 0.62) and MESOR from cosinor analysis (83.48, Z = 1.30) are above average and both have small positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.14 and 0.06 respectively). Elevated basal cardiovascular tone can reflect sustained autonomic arousal that aligns with higher perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z ≈ −0.8) is at the threshold used to indicate generally good sleep quality in the sample and is negatively associated with PSS directionally; this suggests the participant perceives their sleep as relatively acceptable, which would favor lower perceived stress.  
- Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40, Z ≈ 0.26) and correlates negatively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.15); higher self-esteem is a modest protective factor against perceived stress.  
- Several objective rhythm features indicate lower fragmentation or preserved structure: intradaily variability is relatively low (IV = 0.34, Z ≈ −1.45), and interdaily stability is not markedly reduced (IS = 0.37, Z ≈ −0.33). Lower IV (less fragmentation) and reasonable IS can reflect steadier activity/rest cycles; in this dataset, some of these nonparametric measures are associated with lower PSS or show weak associations, which suggests partial resilience.  
- Lifestyle and leisure patterns include time for socializing (1–2 hours), frequent but moderate alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week), and leisure activities (TV, gaming). Several of these behaviors in this sample either show weak or small negative correlations with PSS (e.g., video games r ≈ −0.14), consistent with mixed-to-minimally protective behavioral patterns rather than strong risk.

Physiological day‑night profile and circadian timing interpretation
- The cosinor acrophase falls in the early evening (about 6:58 PM) and aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively low heart rate compared with mesor through much of the late night and morning, with elevated deviations across the late afternoon and evening (peaking ~7–8 PM). This pattern, together with a relatively high MESOR, suggests an elevated baseline cardiovascular tone with a late-evening activation peak rather than a morning peak. Evening-biased physiological activation combined with very late sleep onset (median ≈ 03:17) is consistent with misalignment between circadian/behavioral timing and conventional daytime schedules; such misalignment has been linked in the literature to increased perceived stress and poorer mood even if subjective sleep quality is reported as adequate.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population
- Balancing the evidence, the strongest contributors to inferred perceived stress are elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.25, r with PSS ≈ 0.31) and modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D Z = 0.38, r ≈ 0.28), together with late and irregular sleep timing and modestly elevated basal cardiac tone. Protective signals (good self-reported sleep quality, high self-esteem, and relatively low intradaily variability) moderate but do not fully offset the risk indicators. Therefore the participant’s likely perceived stress level is best described as above the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62).  
- The available data do not allow precise estimation of an individual PSS score here, but qualitatively the pattern suggests higher-than-average perceived stress rather than marked resilience; targeted concerns are trait anxiety and sleep-timing irregularity with some evidence of sustained physiological activation.

If useful, next steps for more granular interpretation would include: (1) comparing the participant’s actual PSS score (if available) to the inferred pattern; (2) examining day-to-day coupling of evening heart-rate elevation with late sleep onset and next-day mood ratings; and (3) considering interventions focused on sleep timing regularity and anxiety management, which would likely impact perceived stress given the associations above."
38610,"Summary and overall inference:
Taken together, the profile presents a mixed signal in relation to perceived stress. Self-report psychological measures (very low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, high self‑esteem and high self‑reported happiness and health satisfaction) point toward lower perceived stress, whereas wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology (short, late sleep and signs of reduced circadian amplitude with a modestly elevated resting heart rate) suggest physiological strain that is often associated with higher perceived stress. Weighing both domains, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level appears near the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.61). Several objective indicators push in the direction of somewhat elevated physiological stress, but strong, consistent self-reported psychological resilience argues against a substantially above‑average perceived stress score.

Sources of evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
Wearable sleep and circadian metrics are the clearest indicators favoring higher perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration is short (5 hours 46 minutes; Z = -1.76), with a very late median sleep start time (~02:39 AM) and modest night‑to‑night variability. Short, delayed sleep is commonly associated with daytime physiological stress and with higher perceived stress in other samples. Circadian heart‑rate features show reduced amplitude (amplitude = 7.23, Z = -1.15), lower interdaily stability (0.37, Z = -0.33) and modestly elevated intradaily variability (0.59, Z = 0.32), a pattern consistent with blunted and less regular circadian organization. Resting heart rate is somewhat elevated (67.7 bpm, Z = 1.14), and cosinor MESOR is similarly elevated (82.33, Z = 1.14); both of these physiology measures have small positive correlations with PSS in the study (resting HR r ≈ 0.14). Together, these objective signals—short and late sleep, blunted circadian amplitude, slightly fragmented daily rhythms, and higher resting HR—are typical of physiological profiles that accompany greater perceived stress or sustained behavioral/physiological strain.

Sources of evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
Multiple self-report measures indicate low psychological distress and buffer against high perceived stress. The CES‑D score is very low (3.0, Z = -1.07; classified “not depressed”), and trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) is low. The Rosenberg Self‑Esteem score is high (Z = 1.66), and current happiness and health satisfaction are both above the sample mean (happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 1.13). Substance use is minimal, recreational drug use absent, and the participant reports frequent social exercise (exercising with others three times a week or more; Z = 1.23), which are behavioral patterns typically associated with lower perceived stress. Academic performance (GPA across terms 3.6–3.86) and low reported depressive/anxiety symptoms further favor a lower subjective stress interpretation.

Integration and interpretation:
There is a discrepancy between subjective reports (low distress, strong positive self–concept and mood) and objective physiology/behavioral timing (short, late sleep; reduced circadian amplitude; slightly elevated resting HR). This pattern can reflect several non‑mutually exclusive possibilities: (a) the participant maintains good psychological well‑being despite lifestyle patterns (late, short sleep) that produce physiological strain; (b) physiological markers reflect behavioral scheduling demands (e.g., late‑night academic or social activity) rather than sustained subjective stress; or (c) early stages of physiological dysregulation that have not yet manifested in self‑reported affective symptoms. Correlations provided in the study support modest links between the wearable circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16) and stress, and between reduced amplitude and higher PSS (r ≈ -0.16), but these are small effects and do not override the participant’s low self‑reported depressive/anxiety symptoms.

Conclusion relative to the sample mean:
Considering both self‑report and wearable data, the participant’s inferred perceived stress is best characterized as near the population mean PSS (21.61). Physiological and sleep-related signs modestly pull the inference toward higher perceived stress, but multiple, robust self‑report measures point toward below‑average psychological distress; on balance this produces an overall estimate close to the sample mean rather than clearly above or below it. The most clinically and behaviorally salient recommendations from this profile would be to monitor sleep timing and duration and consider whether late/short sleep is chronic, because it represents the principal objective risk factor in this otherwise resilient psychological profile."
96610,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of signals, but the strongest and most consistent indicators across self-report and wearable-derived measures point toward relatively lower perceived stress compared with the study sample. Self-report affective indices (CES-D, STAI, Rosenberg self‑esteem, momentary happiness, and health satisfaction) show sizable departures from the study mean in directions associated with lower distress (CES‑D score = 2, Z = -1.18; STAI = 25, Z = -1.61; self‑esteem Z = +1.66; current happiness Z = +1.64; health satisfaction Z = +2.05). Wearable circadian measures likewise show above-average rhythmicity and amplitude (interdaily stability Z = +0.83; amplitude Z = +1.03; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = +0.73), consistent with a relatively robust circadian organization. Taken together, these prominent signals support an inference of perceived stress below the population mean (study sample mean PSS = 21.62).

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Multiple, moderately strong indicators converge on lower perceived stress. Trait mood/anxiety measures are well below the sample mean (STAI and CES‑D Z-scores ~ -1.2 to -1.6), and positive self‑views and momentary well‑being are well above average (self‑esteem and happiness Z ≈ +1.6). Low substance use and engagement in some physical activity (sports 1–2x/week, low alcohol/drug usage) are behavioral patterns typically associated with lower stress burden. Objective physiology supports behavioral regularity: high interdaily stability and amplitude of heart‑rate rhythms (Zs ≈ +0.8 to +1.0) indicate a pronounced day–night contrast and regular daily pattern; prior work and the correlations in this dataset suggest these features tend to relate to lower PSS (correlations with amplitude and interdaily stability are negative: -0.17 and -0.12). The aggregated hourly heart‑rate deviations show a clear nocturnal fall and robust daytime elevations (notably afternoon peaks), which is consistent with preserved sleep‑wake physiology rather than a flattened or blunted rhythm that often accompanies higher stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: A smaller set of measures points in the opposite direction and temper the overall conclusion. Subjective sleep quality is impaired (PSQI = 8, Z = +0.59; classification: disturbed sleep), and median nightly sleep duration is modestly shorter than the sample mean (≈6 h 53 min, Z = -0.37) with a late median sleep onset (≈01:21). Disturbed subjective sleep and shorter sleep duration are both commonly associated with higher perceived stress; in this dataset PSQI shows a positive relationship to PSS. Resting heart rate is slightly above the study mean (60.8 bpm, Z = +0.32) and correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), which provides a small physiological signal in the direction of elevated stress or arousal. These sleep-related and slight cardiovascular signals are important, but their magnitudes are modest relative to the larger salutary signals above.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the population mean: Balancing competing signals, the dominant pattern is one of low-to-moderate perceived stress relative to the study sample. Strong, convergent self-report indicators of low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem and happiness, and robust circadian rhythm metrics outweigh the more moderate indicators of elevated stress (impaired subjective sleep and a slightly higher resting heart rate). Therefore the participant’s overall inferred PSS level is likely below the study population mean (PSS mean = 21.62). This conclusion should be tempered by two caveats: (1) disrupted subjective sleep quality and late sleep timing are risk factors that could increase perceived stress if they persist or worsen, and (2) associations in the dataset are generally modest in size, so inferences about an individual carry uncertainty. In sum, current evidence favors an estimate of perceived stress below the sample mean, with vigilance recommended regarding sleep quality as a potential target for intervention or monitoring."
77711,"Overview: The participant’s profile shows a mix of psychological vulnerabilities and behavioral/physiological markers that point in both directions with respect to perceived stress. Notable self-report signals include elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = 1.06) and disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7), alongside relatively low self-esteem (RSES = 28, Z = -1.43). Objective wearable data show generally robust circadian amplitude and pronounced midday cardiovascular activation, a relatively low resting heart rate (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68), and a moderately short but consistent sleep duration (median 6 h 55 m, Z = -0.33). Taken together, these data suggest a participant who experiences some chronic anxiety and sleep-related difficulties but also demonstrates physiological markers consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and a degree of daily regularity.

Factors consistent with relatively high perceived stress: The strongest psychological indicator of elevated stress is trait anxiety (STAI), which is substantially above sample mean (Z = 1.06) and has a positive correlation with PSS in the study (r ≈ 0.32). Subjective sleep complaints (PSQI = 7) also favor higher perceived stress: the score exceeds the typical clinical cutoff (>5) and poor sleep is a known correlate of higher PSS in the sample. Low self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.43) and modest health satisfaction (Z = -0.62) are additional psychosocial features that tend to co-occur with greater perceived stress. Behaviorally, relatively late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 01:02 AM) and a lower interdaily stability (0.34, Z = -0.57) suggest a less regular daily schedule, which can exacerbate stress or reduce resilience. Together, these features provide multiple convergent signals that would tend to push an inferred PSS score upward relative to the cohort.

Factors consistent with relatively low perceived stress: Several objective and behavioral features point toward lower perceived stress or greater resilience. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.4 bpm, Z = -0.68), which often reflects greater cardiovascular fitness or lower basal autonomic arousal. Circadian amplitude is close to the cohort mean (amplitude = 10.52, Z = -0.08) and intradaily variability is lower than average (0.51, Z = -0.25), indicating limited within-day fragmentation of activity—both features that are generally associated with more structured physiological rhythms and can be protective with respect to stress. The participant reports limited substance use and moderate social engagement (socializing ~1–2 hours/day), and academic performance is high (GPA consistently near or at the top of the scale), which may reflect effective coping, organization, or external sources of competence and support that reduce perceived stress. Self-reported current happiness is slightly above average (Z = 0.55), another modest protective signal.

Physiological detail and caveats: Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations reveal pronounced midday cardiovascular peaks (e.g., 1–2 pm deviation ≈ +17.8 bpm, Z ≈ 1.65; 2–3 pm ≈ +15.6 bpm, Z ≈ 1.59; 11 am–12 pm ≈ +14.0 bpm, Z ≈ 1.25). These elevated daytime deviations suggest concentrated periods of physiological activation in the late-morning to early-afternoon window; however, the study-level correlations between many hourly deviations and PSS are small and mixed, so these daytime peaks should be interpreted cautiously—they may reflect scheduled activity, caffeine/meal effects, or work demands rather than global stress. Nighttime heart-rate dips are pronounced and within expected ranges, consistent with relatively preserved nocturnal recovery. Also note that many correlations provided between individual metrics and PSS are modest in magnitude; they inform interpretation but do not deterministically predict perceived stress for an individual.

Holistic conclusion relative to the sample mean PSS: Balancing the evidence, the participant exhibits several signals that tilt toward elevated perceived stress (notably high trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance, and low self-esteem), but also several protective features (low resting heart rate, stable within-day rhythm, strong academic functioning, low substance use). On balance, the data are most consistent with a perceived stress level that is slightly above the study sample mean rather than markedly higher or lower. In other words, the participant’s inferred PSS is likely above the population mean of 21.63 but not an extreme outlier; the pattern indicates moderate elevation in perceived stress with important areas of resilience. Direct measurement of the PSS for this participant (if not already available) would clarify this inference and could be combined with targeted assessment of sleep quality and trait anxiety to prioritize interventions if needed."
17020,"Summary: The participant presents a mixed multimodal profile in which subjective reports, behavioral patterns, and wearable-derived physiology point to both stress-related risk factors and some protective signals. Subjectively, the participant endorsed elevated sleep disturbance (PSQI = 7) and lower momentary well-being (happiness rating 3.0, health satisfaction relatively low), while trait anxiety (STAI = 40) is near the study mean but described as “anxious.” Objective wearable data show relatively preserved total sleep duration (median ~7 h 7 min) but a markedly late average sleep onset (median start ~02:12) and elevated night-to-night sleep variability (SD = 108 min). Circadian summary metrics show reduced amplitude (Z = -1.21) and a very low MESOR (Z = -1.95), with higher intradaily variability (Z = 0.67). Resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm, Z = -1.18). Taken together, these pieces form a nuanced picture: some behaviors align with elevated perceived stress while other objective markers suggest physiological patterns more typical of lower arousal or greater fitness.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several behavioral and circadian indicators are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. The participant reports disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI > 5) and shows late, irregular sleep timing (median sleep start ~2:12 AM and sleep SD ~108 min), which often co-occur with higher stress and poorer recovery. Intradaily variability in heart rate (Z = 0.67) is elevated, indicating greater fragmentation of activity/arousal across the day; this metric correlates positively with PSS in the sample and is interpreted as a risk correlate. Low engagement in social and recreational activities (short daily socializing, minimal exercise, limited leisure reading/listening) and elevated internet use are behavioral patterns that tend to accompany greater perceived stress or reduced coping. Self-reported momentary happiness is below average (Z ≈ -0.53), and trait anxiety (STAI) is present at a level that correlates with PSS in this sample, both of which point toward higher subjective stress burden.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several objective physiological and symptom measures argue against a strongly elevated PSS. Resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm, Z = -1.18), and the participant’s median sleep duration (~7 h) is within a healthy range; both are typically associated with better physiological recovery and lower chronic arousal. Depressive symptom burden is modest (CES-D = 10, classified “not depressed” and with a below-mean Z-score), and global self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40), a psychosocial buffer that generally reduces perceived stress. The participant’s interdaily stability (Z = 0.17) and autocorrelation at 24 hours indicate some preserved day-to-day regularity despite intraday fragmentation. Some midday heart rate elevations (e.g., sizable positive deviation 12–1 pm) are pronounced relative to the sample and have negative correlations with PSS in this dataset, suggesting moments of expected daytime activation rather than continual hyperarousal.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population: Balancing subjective reports and behavioral risk indicators against physiological protections yields an interpretation of mildly elevated perceived stress. Several behavioral and subjective indicators that typically align with higher PSS (disturbed sleep quality, late and irregular sleep timing, elevated intradaily variability, low social/exercise engagement, lower happiness) are present and carry nontrivial correlations with PSS in this sample. However, objective cardiovascular indicators (low resting HR, adequate median sleep duration) and low depressive symptom scores are protective. On net, the pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level slightly above the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). The participant’s profile suggests moderate, situationally influenced stress rather than extreme or clinically severe stress, with circadian misalignment and lifestyle factors being the most salient targets if one wanted to reduce perceived stress."
29885,"Summary impression: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of signals. Self-report mood and sleep questionnaires show modest elevations in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety alongside disturbed subjective sleep and lower self-esteem; these features are commonly associated with greater perceived stress. In contrast, wearable-derived physiology and behavioral regularity indicate a well-entrained circadian pattern, relatively low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and low variability in nightly sleep duration—features that tend to be associated with lower perceived stress or resilience. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests this participant’s perceived stress level is around the study sample average and may be marginally elevated relative to the population mean, but not by a large margin.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z = 0.38) and above-average trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17); both scales correlate positively with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28, STAI r ≈ 0.31), so these survey elevations point toward greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep disturbance is also present (PSQI = 7, classified as disturbed sleep), a common correlate of higher PSS. Behavioral habits include relatively frequent alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor reported 1–2 times per week, Z ≈ 1.0), high time spent on a sedentary hobby (Z = 1.41), and reduced self-esteem (RSES = 33, Z = −0.73), each of which can be associated with greater stress or diminished coping in this population. The participant’s median sleep start time is quite late (about 01:57 AM), which—independent of sleep duration—can reflect evening arousal, shifted routines, or lifestyle stressors that relate to higher perceived stress in student samples.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Wearable-derived circadian metrics show marked regularity and robustness: high interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0), high 24-hour autocorrelation (0.45, Z = 1.06), relatively large circadian amplitude (14.65, Z = 1.25), and low intradaily variability (0.43, Z = −0.81). In this sample these patterns generally associate with lower PSS (interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ −0.17; amplitude r ≈ −0.16). The participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (53.2 bpm, Z = −0.59), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and behavioral activity patterns (reports of exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; exercise Z-scores >1.0), factors that typically buffer perceived stress. Nightly sleep duration is fairly consistent (median ~6 h 56 min, sleep duration SD ≈ 35 minutes, Z = −1.5), indicating stable sleep quantity across the recording period; stability of sleep timing and duration is often protective against sustained perceived stress. Subjective indicators of well-being are mixed but include above-average health satisfaction (Z = 0.97) and moderately elevated current happiness (Z = 0.55), which would tend to reduce perceived stress.

Integration and overall comparison to the study sample mean: Several self-report indicators (depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, disturbed sleep, low self‑esteem) point toward increased perceived stress, while objective wearable metrics (robust circadian structure, low intraday fragmentation, low resting heart rate, regular sleep patterns) and frequent exercise point toward lower perceived stress. Given the moderate magnitude of the psychological elevations (small positive z-scores) and the relatively strong positive indicators from physiology/behavioral regularity (larger positive z-scores for stability and amplitude, and negative z for intradaily variability), the net picture is most consistent with perceived stress near the study population mean, with a slight tilt toward being above the mean rather than well below it. Stated relative to the study sample mean PSS (21.62 ± 3.68), the data support describing this participant’s inferred perceived-stress level as near the population mean and possibly slightly above average.

Caveats: These inferences combine cross-sectional questionnaire data and aggregated wearable summaries and do not substitute for direct PSS measurement or clinical assessment. Correlations reported in the dataset are modest and do not establish causation; individual differences in coping, context (academic deadlines), or unmeasured stressors could shift the perceived stress level away from the inferred placement."
79167,"Summary of evidence consistent with lower perceived stress:
The self-report profile contains multiple, robust indicators that typically align with lower perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = −1.71) and depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 3, Z = −1.07) are both well below the study mean, and current happiness and health-satisfaction ratings are relatively high (Happy Z = 1.64; Health Satisfaction Z = 2.05). Self-esteem is elevated (Z = 1.24). Sleep outcomes are favorable: median nightly sleep is long relative to the sample (8 h 11 m, Z = 1.25) and subjective sleep quality is in the “good” range on the PSQI (score = 5, Z = −0.8). Behavioral habits that tend to reduce stress—frequent exercise (multiple modalities, Zs > 1.0), minimal recreational drug use, low sedentary/recreational screen time, and no reported daily naps—further support a lower perceived stress profile. Wearable physiology consistent with lower stress includes a relatively low resting heart rate (52.7 bpm, Z = −0.65) and a modestly lower mesor (Z = −0.81), which are compatible with higher fitness and lower tonic sympathetic arousal in this sample.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress or physiological dysregulation:
Several wearable-derived circadian rhythm indices indicate reduced regularity and greater fragmentation of daily physiology, features that in this sample are modestly associated with higher PSS. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.28, Z = −1.07) and 24‑hour autocorrelation is reduced (Z = −0.87), while intradaily variability is elevated (0.65, Z = 0.74). Amplitude of the fitted heart‑rate rhythm is attenuated (7.58, Z = −1.03), suggesting a blunted day–night difference. These three features (lower stability, higher fragmentation, lower amplitude) are the strongest wearable signals that typically correlate with greater perceived stress in population analyses. Some hourly heart-rate deviations (for example elevated relative heart rate at early morning hours and a pronounced morning peak Z = 3.07 at 6–7am) show modest positive correlations with PSS in the sample (correlations in the 0.14–0.23 range), which could reflect transient morning arousal related to schedule demands. Overall, the effect sizes of these associations are small-to-moderate and the circadian irregularity measures counterbalance—but do not fully override—the protective self-report profile.

Holistic synthesis and comparative statement:
Weighing the available multimodal information, the balance of evidence favors a perceived-stress level below the study population mean. Self-report measures that directly index mood and trait anxiety are notably lower than typical in this sample (STAI Z = −1.71; CES-D Z = −1.07), positive well‑being indicators are elevated (happiness, self‑esteem, health satisfaction), sleep quantity and subjective quality are good, and behavioral health (exercise, low substance use) is protective. Although wearable circadian metrics indicate reduced day‑to‑day regularity and somewhat elevated fragmentation—features that modestly associate with higher PSS—these physiological signals are of smaller magnitude relative to the strong, consistent protective pattern in the self-reports and sleep metrics. Therefore, relative to the study sample mean PSS of 21.65 (SD = 3.63; median = 22), the participant’s inferred perceived stress is most consistent with being below the population mean.

Limitations and caveats:
This inference integrates indirect correlates of perceived stress (questionnaire composites, circadian indices, and heart-rate proxies) rather than a direct PSS score for the individual. The circadian irregularity could reflect schedule variability (e.g., class/exercise timing) or high daytime activity rather than chronic psychological stress. Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the sample are generally modest, so conclusions should be considered probabilistic. If clinical or research decisions depend on exact stress level, direct administration of the PSS or longitudinal follow-up would reduce uncertainty."
22455,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile presents a generally low-to-moderate burden of self-reported affective symptoms alongside wearable-derived signatures of reduced circadian robustness and somewhat restricted sleep duration. Self-report indices that most strongly predict perceived stress in this sample (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, self-rated happiness/health) are oriented toward lower stress than the study mean, while several objective activity- and heart rate–derived circadian features (reduced amplitude, lower interdaily stability, greater intra-day variability) point in the opposite direction. Taken together, the balance of evidence — with stronger weight on the low trait-anxiety and high well-being scores — suggests the participant’s perceived stress is likely below the sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.59).

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Trait measures show consistently favorable values. The STAI–Trait score is low (28, Z = -1.31) and the CES-D depressive symptom score is near the sample mean (12, Z = -0.14); both of these scales are positively correlated with PSS in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.32; CES-D r ≈ 0.29), so low scores here argue for lower PSS. Self-esteem and momentary well-being are elevated (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = +1.10; “Happy” Z = +1.64) and health satisfaction is high (Z = +1.96); these measures have negative or weak correlations with PSS and therefore further support lower perceived stress. Low substance use, regular solitary exercise (frequency Z ≈ +1.07), and good subjective sleep quality on the PSQI (score = 5, Z ≈ -0.8) also align with lower stress-related risk.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Wearable-derived circadian/behavioral markers indicate reduced regularity and amplitude of heart-rate rhythms, which in this sample are modestly associated with higher PSS. Specifically, interdaily stability is reduced (value 0.30, Z ≈ -0.9) and circadian amplitude is relatively blunted (amplitude Z ≈ -1.52; amplitude correlates r ≈ -0.16 with PSS), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z ≈ +0.32, r ≈ +0.16). Median nightly sleep duration is shorter than the study mean (6 h 7 min, Z ≈ -1.33) and sleep duration variability is elevated (SD Z ≈ +0.94); both shorter and more variable sleep are commonly linked to worse stress and have small positive correlations with PSS in this dataset. Daily sedentary/leisure patterns (high TV/internet/music use; TV Z ≈ +2.54) could reflect time displacement from restorative activities and are weakly associated with higher PSS here.

Physiological specifics and circadian timing: Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.8 bpm, Z ≈ -0.52), which can reflect cardiovascular fitness and does not by itself indicate elevated stress (resting HR correlates modestly with PSS, r ≈ +0.14). The cosinor-derived acrophase is mid-day (≈12:35 PM) and MESOR is lower than average (Z ≈ -1.04). Of note, the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show unusually large positive deviations in the early morning (5–7 AM: Zs +6.2 and +4.3), which is an outlying pattern relative to the sample. This pattern could reflect consistent early-morning activity or exercise, frequent early awakenings, or an artifact of aggregation; its interpretation in relation to stress is uncertain but it stands out as physiologically atypical and warrants follow-up if clinical inference is important.

Holistic inference relative to the study mean: Because the stronger, more directly stress-related self-report predictors (low trait anxiety, low depressive symptoms, high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction) point robustly toward less perceived stress while wearable markers point to mild circadian disruption and reduced sleep duration, the most justified summary is that the participant’s perceived stress level is likely below the population mean PSS (i.e., below 21.59), though not uniformly low across all modalities. The discrepancy between favorable subjective affect and modest objective circadian disruption suggests the participant may be coping effectively despite sleep timing variability or that objective rhythm irregularities are an early or subclinical correlate rather than reflecting high current perceived stress.

Caveats: Inferences about perceived stress here rely on correlational relationships and cross-modal interpretation rather than a measured PSS score for this participant. Some wearable anomalies (notably the large early-morning heart-rate deviations) may be measurement artifacts or reflect habitual behaviors (e.g., early exercise) and should be verified with contextual data (activity logs, sleep/wake reports) before attributing them to stress."
57443,"Summary: The participant’s data present a mixed profile of psychological, behavioral and physiological features. Self-report measures show modest elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 19, Z = 0.59) and a mid-range trait anxiety score (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13), alongside relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11) and self-reported happiness (current = 4, Z = 0.55). Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a well-structured heart-rate rhythm (interdaily stability Z = 0.75; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 1.15; amplitude Z = 0.69), consistent sleep timing and duration (median sleep 7 h 14 min, sleep-duration SD Z = -1.33), and relatively low daytime napping. Resting heart rate and overall mesor are elevated relative to the study sample (RHR = 61.2 bpm, mesor Z = 0.36 and 0.85 respectively). Taken together, the pattern suggests some psychological symptom burden coupled with physiologically regular daily rhythms and generally adequate sleep.

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress: 
- Elevated depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 19; Z = 0.59) and a positive association between CES-D and PSS in the sample (correlation ~0.28) indicate affective symptoms that typically co-occur with greater perceived stress. 
- Trait anxiety shows a modest positive sample correlation with PSS (STAI correlation ~0.31), and the participant’s STAI score (40) is consistent with some chronic anxiety proneness. 
- Heart-rate–based indices of physiological arousal are modestly elevated: mesor and resting heart rate are above the sample mean (mesor Z = 0.85; RHR Z = 0.36) and sample correlations indicate a small positive relationship between higher resting heart rate and higher PSS (r ≈ 0.14). 
- Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations at certain early-morning hours show positive correlations with PSS (e.g., 3–6am deviations correlate ~0.19–0.22), which could reflect greater nocturnal physiological activation in persons reporting higher stress. 
- Some within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability) has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), and though the participant’s intradaily variability is near the sample average (Z ≈ 0.03), any increase in fragmentation is generally linked to higher perceived stress.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress:
- Circadian regularity and rhythm robustness are strong potential protective factors: interdaily stability is higher than average (Z = 0.75) and 24-hour autocorrelation is markedly high (Z = 1.15). Sample correlations show these rhythm-regularity metrics trend toward negative associations with PSS (e.g., interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; amplitude r ≈ -0.17), consistent with lower perceived stress in individuals with more stable rhythms. 
- Sleep metrics are generally favorable: median sleep duration (~7 h 14 min, Z ≈ 0.06) and especially low night-to-night variability (sleep-duration SD Z = -1.33) are characteristics typically associated with lower perceived stress. The PSQI score (5.0, Z = -0.8) classifies as relatively good subjective sleep quality in this sample. The participant reports no naps and a reasonably consistent sleep start time (median ~00:24), both of which align with lower stress-related sleep disruption. 
- Health and lifestyle variables that correlate with lower stress include minimal substance use (no reported alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use), moderate social interaction (1–2 hours/day), relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 0.22), high self-esteem, and current happiness. These behavioral and self-evaluative factors are either neutral or negatively correlated with PSS in the sample and suggest resources or behaviors that mitigate perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: Considering both sides, the participant shows indicators of psychological symptom burden (notably elevated depressive symptoms and some trait anxiety) and modestly increased cardiovascular tone, which point toward greater perceived stress. However, multiple robust protective indicators—high circadian regularity, consistent and adequate sleep, low substance use, strong self-esteem and reasonable subjective well-being—argue against a substantially elevated stress profile. On balance, the pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level near the study population mean (Population mean PSS = 21.61). If anything, the net signal suggests a stress level close to the mean with a modest upward bias driven by depressive symptoms and slightly elevated cardiac indices, rather than a clear, large elevation above the sample average.

Implications for interpretation: The presence of elevated depressive symptoms and small physiological signs of arousal warrant attention when interpreting perceived stress for this individual; however, chronobiological stability and good sleep are likely buffering perceived stress. Monitoring depressive symptoms and nighttime physiological activation (e.g., nocturnal heart-rate elevations) alongside maintenance of sleep regularity and health behaviors would clarify whether stress is increasing over time."
94579,"Elevating indicators — evidence consistent with relatively greater perceived stress: the participant reports elevated mood and anxiety symptoms that typically accompany higher perceived stress. The CES-D score is 24 (Z = 1.11; labeled “Depressed” in the dataset) and the trait anxiety (STAI) score is 44 (Z = 0.27); both measures have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29; STAI r ≈ 0.32), indicating these self-reported symptom levels are likely to co-occur with higher perceived stress. Objective sleep patterns add to this concern: median nightly sleep duration is 6 h 38 min (Z = −0.69), which is shorter than the study mean, and there is very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 242 minutes, Z = 3.21) and in sleep start time (median start ≈ 02:07; start-time SD Z = 1.54). Those measures (sleep variability and late/irregular bedtimes) have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSS in the sample (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.17, sleep start-time SD r ≈ 0.18), and together they indicate fragmented or irregular sleep opportunity that commonly coincides with higher perceived stress. Finally, subjective wellbeing items (lower current happiness, RSES self-esteem slightly below mean) trend in the same direction and align with the elevated depressive/anxiety scores, reinforcing the pattern consistent with greater perceived stress.

Protective indicators — evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: several behavioral and circadian/physiological features are plausibly stress-buffering. The participant reports frequent exercise and sports participation (“three times a week or more”; exercise Z-scores range from ~1.07 to 1.58), frequent socializing and recreational reading/listening-to-music (reading Z = 4.24; socializing Z ≈ 0.95; music Z ≈ 1.13), and very low recreational substance use — all of which are associated in the literature with resilience against stress and, in this dataset, show either weak or negative correlations with PSS. Wearable-derived circadian structure is relatively intact: interdaily stability is above average (value 0.49, Z = 0.67), intradaily variability is slightly below average (Z = −0.18), and autocorrelation at 24 h is positive (Z = 0.48). Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.6 bpm, Z = −0.07), and the cosinor-derived amplitude (Z = 0.39) and acrophase (peak at ~4:17 PM) indicate a pronounced day–night contrast in heart-rate activity rather than a flattened or blunted rhythm. These physiological patterns (stable day-to-day rhythm, lower resting HR, distinct daytime peaks) are more consistent with preserved circadian regulation and physical fitness and are factors that tend to oppose elevated perceived stress.

Circadian and wearable heart-rate detail — integrative interpretation: hourly heart-rate deviations from mesor show the expected deep nocturnal troughs (down to about −22 bpm overnight) and a pronounced daytime rise with the largest positive aggregate deviation around 10–11 AM (+15.4 bpm, Z = 1.51). The acrophase near late afternoon (4:17 PM) and an amplitude just above the sample mean indicate clear daytime increases in cardiovascular tone. Interdaily stability above the sample mean (Z = 0.67) suggests the participant’s overall daily scheduling or activity pattern is relatively consistent across days, despite the late median sleep timing (≈2:07 AM). The apparent discrepancy between subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5.0, Z = −0.8, classified as “Good Sleep” relative to the sample) and objective measures (short median duration, very high night-to-night variability, late and inconsistent sleep onset) is notable: subjectively the participant reports acceptable sleep quality, but wearable-derived metrics point to a pattern (late timing and high variability) that is often associated with daytime sleepiness, impaired recovery, and increased perceived stress risk. Small positive correlations between some early-morning heart-rate deviations and PSS (r ≈ 0.14–0.21 at 2–6 AM) further suggest that nocturnal physiology may be modestly related to stress in this individual.

Synthesis and inferred comparison to the study mean PSS: weighing the evidence produces a mixed but tilted picture. The participant shows marked protective lifestyle factors (regular exercise, social engagement, low substance use) and preserved circadian organization, which tend to lower perceived stress. However, elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptom scores, late and highly variable sleep timing/duration, and subjective reductions in positive affect are salient indicators that align with higher perceived stress. Given the magnitude and consistency of the affective symptom elevations (CES-D Z ≈ +1.11; STAI positive correlation with PSS) together with objective sleep irregularity that is linked to PSS in the sample, the balanced inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is likely above the study population mean (population PSS mean = 21.63, SD = 3.67). The elevation suggested by the symptom profile and sleep instability appears moderate rather than extreme, so a characterization of “moderately above the population mean” is most consistent with the multimodal data."
29257,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived measures the participant shows a mixed but overall more favorable profile with respect to perceived stress. Self-report indexes of mood and trait affect (CES-D = 2, z = -1.18; STAI–Trait = 31, z = -1.02) and sleep quality (PSQI = 4, z = -1.26) are well below the sample means, and trait self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average (RSES z = 1.10; health satisfaction z = 0.72). Wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration is slightly above the sample average (7 h 49 m, z = 0.79) and resting heart rate is modestly lower-than-average to near-average (59.2 bpm, z = 0.12). Taken together, these primary indices point toward relatively lower perceived stress compared with the study sample.

Features that point toward lower perceived stress: Low scores on depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (CES-D and STAI both >1 SD below the sample mean) are strong, direct self-report indicators that typically track with lower perceived stress. Good subjective sleep quality (PSQI below the common clinical cutoff and z < -1) and a median sleep duration near eight hours provide further evidence for adequate restorative sleep, which tends to co-occur with lower perceived stress. High self-esteem (z = +1.10) and above-average health satisfaction are additional psychosocial resources associated with lower stress. Behavioral markers such as minimal recreational drug use and moderate regular exercise, along with generally normal resting heart rate, are also consistent with a lower-stress profile.

Features that point toward higher perceived stress or that could increase vulnerability: Several wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate irregularity that has previously related to perceived stress. Interdaily stability is low (0.26, z = -1.23), reflecting less consistent day-to-day timing of physiological rhythms; this metric’s direction in the sample was associated with stress (correlation in the provided data). Sleep timing is late on average (median sleep start ≈ 01:32) and night-to-night sleep duration variability is elevated (SD = 151 minutes, z = +1.14), both of which are behavioral patterns that can co-occur with higher perceived stress or make stress regulation more difficult. The cosinor amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is reduced (z = -0.75), and some circadian features (e.g., certain nocturnal heart-rate deviations and reduced amplitude) show positive correlations with PSS in the dataset; these associations suggest that particular aspects of nocturnal physiology and rhythm dampening are linked to higher perceived stress in the study sample. Finally, unusually high (relative) time spent listening to music (z = +2.06) was positively correlated with PSS in this sample; while this could reflect a benign coping behavior, in this dataset it aligns slightly with higher reported stress.

Integration and holistic conclusion: The most direct and robust indicators in this participant’s profile—very low depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, good subjective sleep quality, high self-esteem, and generally healthy lifestyle markers—weight strongly toward an inference of lower perceived stress. Countervailing evidence is present in measures of circadian regularity and sleep timing variability (low interdaily stability, late average sleep onset, high night-to-night sleep variability, and reduced circadian amplitude), which are known to be associated with greater perceived stress in group-level data and therefore indicate some vulnerability. On balance, the stronger, more direct psychosocial indicators outweigh the circadian irregularities in the present multimodal picture.

Relative to the study sample mean PSS (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the participant’s combined profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level below the population mean. This conclusion rests primarily on the very low CES-D and STAI trait scores, good subjective sleep quality, and higher self-esteem—measures that have relatively strong construct overlap with perceived stress—while acknowledging that circadian irregularity and sleep timing variability introduce a modest countervailing risk."
49539,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals. Psychometrically, self-report measures of trait affect are notably low for anxiety (STAI = 23, Z = -1.81) and depressive symptoms are minimal (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07), while self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average (Self‑Esteem Z = 0.96; Health Satisfaction Z = 0.80). Wearable-derived physiology indicates a relatively low baseline cardiovascular level (MESOR 62.4, Z = -1.57; Resting HR 47.8 bpm, Z = -1.23) and generally consistent sleep duration (median 7 h 20 m, sleep SD 36 min, Z = -1.47). However, features of circadian fragmentation and evening physiological arousal are pronounced (intradaily variability = 0.83, Z = 2.01; an extreme aggregate heart‑rate deviation at 11pm–12am, value = +35.6, Z = 4.79), and the participant has a late median sleep start (≈01:45). Considering these convergent and divergent signals, the balance of evidence points to perceived stress that is likely near the study population mean, with some indications of situational or circadian disruption that could increase perceived stress at times.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several wearable-derived metrics associated in the literature with stress or circadian dysregulation are elevated. Intradaily variability (IV) is high (Z = 2.01), indicating frequent within‑day transitions or fragmentation of activity/heart‑rate rhythms—a pattern that has been linked to worse subjective stress and poorer mood. The aggregated hourly heart‑rate profile shows an unusually large positive deviation from the mesor at 11pm–12am (value +35.6, Z = 4.79), implying marked evening physiological arousal during pre‑sleep hours; combined with a late median sleep onset (~1:45 AM), this pattern suggests late‑evening activation that can undermine subjective rest and raise stress-like experiences. The self‑reported PSQI is 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”), which, despite objective sleep duration being adequate, signals subjective sleep problems that often amplify perceived stress. Low frequency of exercise/social physical activity and limited recreational downtime may reduce behavioral buffering against stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: In contrast, several robust indicators point away from chronically elevated stress. Trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are well below sample means (STAI and CES‑D Z’s ≈ -1.8 and -1.1), and reported self‑esteem and satisfaction with health are above average—psychological resources typically associated with lower perceived stress. Objective cardiovascular baselines (low MESOR and low resting HR) and a modestly stable interdaily rhythm (interdaily stability Z = 0.75; autocorrelation at 24 hours Z = 0.64) suggest good overall physiologic recovery and daily regularity at a coarse level. Sleep duration is, on median, in a healthy range with low night‑to‑night variability (sleep SD Z = -1.47), which tends to protect against higher perceived stress. Substance use is absent and depressive/anxiety symptom burdens are minimal, further weighing against high perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study population mean PSS: Integrating self‑report and wearable signals produces a nuanced picture. The participant displays several protective characteristics (low trait anxiety and depression, high self‑esteem, low resting HR, stable sleep duration) that argue for lower perceived stress relative to peers. At the same time, pronounced within‑day fragmentation (high IV), objective evidence of late‑evening physiological arousal (large HR departure at 11pm–12am), and subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) are salient risk correlates of elevated momentary or situational stress. Taken together, the most defensible inference is that this individual’s overall perceived stress level is near the study sample mean, perhaps slightly below it; the data do not strongly support a markedly higher-than‑average chronic perceived stress level but do indicate periods (evenings/bedtime) and circadian irregularities that could elevate stress experience transiently. Stated plainly: inferred perceived stress relative to the study population mean (M = 21.61, SD = 3.68) is near the mean, with some evidence for modestly lower chronic stress but important situational/circadian risk factors that could increase reported stress at particular times."
63904,"Elevated indicators consistent with greater perceived stress: The participant’s self-report profile shows multiple strong signals that typically track with higher perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 30, Z = 1.74) and trait anxiety (STAI = 53, Z = 1.16) are both well above the study mean and have positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), making them salient contributors to a higher inferred PSS. Low current happiness (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61) and reduced self-esteem (RSES = 30, Z = -1.15) further align with higher stress vulnerability given their negative associations with well-being measures. Behaviorally, the participant reports little to no exercise and no recreational substance use; the absence of physical activity (exercise “not at all,” Zs ≈ -1.6 to -1.9) is a behavioral pattern commonly associated with worse stress management. Sleep-derived metrics are also consistent with elevated stress: median wearable-recorded sleep duration is short (5 h 49 min, Z = -1.69) and the PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (score = 6), both of which often accompany higher perceived stress even if the direct PSS correlations here are modest. Finally, several wearable-derived physiological features (slightly elevated resting HR relative to the cohort, mesor and some daytime heart-rate elevations) and a relatively blunted amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ -0.06 with amplitude–PSS correlation ≈ -0.17) can indicate reduced physiological resiliency that tends to occur alongside greater perceived stress.

Protective indicators consistent with lower perceived stress: Several objective circadian and social features suggest relative resilience that would act against very high perceived stress. Measures of circadian regularity derived from heart rate—interdaily stability (value = 0.53, Z ≈ 1.0) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.45, Z ≈ 1.06)—are above the cohort mean and have negative correlations with PSS in the sample (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12; autocorrelation r ≈ -0.17). These indicate a reasonably consistent daily rhythm across the recording period, a factor typically associated with lower stress and better mood regulation. Social activity is above average (socializing 2–3 hours, Z ≈ 0.95), which can serve as a buffering resource against stress. The participant reports no alcohol or drug use (Z-scores substantially below the cohort mean), a pattern that reduces some behavioral risk factors for stress-related dysregulation. Finally, variability in sleep timing is not especially elevated (sleep start SD ≈ 60 min, Z ≈ -0.5) and daytime heart-rate elevations show a normative afternoon acrophase (≈3:36 PM), both of which are consistent with preserved circadian organization.

Integration and relative weight of evidence: The pattern of findings is mixed but leans toward higher perceived stress. The strongest and most directly relevant signals are the pronounced depressive symptoms and elevated trait anxiety (both substantially above the cohort mean and positively associated with PSS), together with objectively short nightly sleep—these factors carry relatively large effect sizes in psychological models of perceived stress and therefore dominate the interpretation. Counterbalancing factors—robust interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate, above-average socializing, and low substance use—attenuate the degree of expected stress but are of smaller magnitude in relation to the participant’s high symptom scores. Physiological metrics (resting HR near cohort mean, modestly reduced amplitude, and moderate intradaily variability) give a nuanced picture: there is preserved day–night separation and regularity but some signs of blunting/fragmentation that align with the elevated symptom burden.

Conclusion relative to the study sample mean: Considering the preponderance of evidence—especially high CES-D and STAI scores, low subjective happiness and self-esteem, and markedly short median sleep—the participant’s overall perceived stress is best characterized as above the population mean PSS score (study mean = 21.61). The protective circadian regularity and social engagement likely moderate, but do not fully offset, the risk suggested by the psychological symptomatology and sleep shortness; thus the participant is inferred to be moderately above the sample mean rather than extremely elevated."
20335,"Summary and overall inferred PSS placement
Taken together, the multimodal evidence points to a participant whose profile is more consistent with lower-than-average perceived stress in this study sample. Self-report affective and trait measures (very low CES-D and STAI scores, above-average self-esteem and current happiness) and multiple wearable-derived markers of regular, robust circadian physiology outweigh some localized indicators of evening/nighttime arousal. Using the study population context (mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the balance of evidence supports an inferred perceived stress level below the population mean.

Evidence consistent with relatively low perceived stress
- Self-report mood and trait measures are strongly in the low-stress direction: CES-D = 2 (Z ≈ -1.18; “not depressed”) and STAI-Trait = 23 (Z ≈ -1.81; “not anxious”), and current happiness is high (rating = 5.0, Z ≈ 1.64). These are direct indicators that the participant reports few depressive/anxious symptoms and generally positive affect.  
- Psychological resilience / resources are indicated: self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z ≈ 1.66), and health satisfaction is above average (Z ≈ 1.3), both of which are typically associated with lower perceived stress.  
- Circadian regularity and rhythm robustness point toward physiological stability: interdaily stability is elevated (0.57, Z ≈ 1.33) and amplitude from cosinor analysis is above average (13.56, Z ≈ 0.9). Elevated interdaily stability and amplitude generally index consistent daily routines and a strong day–night physiological signal, factors that correlate weakly with lower PSS in this sample.  
- Fitness/physiological baseline is favorable: resting heart rate is relatively low (55 bpm, Z ≈ -0.37), which usually reflects good cardiovascular conditioning and a lower basal physiological stress load.  
- Behavioral protective habits: frequent exercise (exercised alone three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.07) and low recreational drug use are behaviors commonly associated with reduced stress perception.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress (or stress-relevant behaviors)
- Late sleep timing and somewhat short sleep duration: median sleep start is late (about 01:53 AM) and median sleep duration is modest (6 h 35 min, Z ≈ -0.74). Shorter sleep and delayed bedtimes can contribute to higher perceived stress or reduce resilience to stressors even when subjective sleep quality is not reported as poor. The PSQI = 5 is at the typical cutoff for sleep disturbance (classified here as “Good Sleep” but borderline), so subjective sleep problems are not prominent but objective timing and duration are less optimal.  
- Evening and nocturnal physiological arousal: hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced positive deviations in late evening and around midnight (notably 12–1 AM: +23.9 bpm, Z ≈ 3.66; 6–7 PM: +20.3 bpm, Z ≈ 1.35; 11–12 PM: +13.7 bpm, Z ≈ 1.53). These sizable evening/midnight elevations relative to the mesor suggest periods of heightened physiological activation late at night. Given the late sleep onset and self-reported leisure profile (high time spent on video games, sedentary hobby, and substantial socializing), these arousal periods plausibly reflect stimulating evening behaviors (or occasional stress-related activation) that could elevate perceived stress or impair recovery if frequent.  
- Some within-day fragmentation: intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.66, Z ≈ 0.81). Higher intradaily variability indicates greater fragmentation of activity/physiological state across the day and has a weak positive correlation with PSS in this sample. This may reflect irregular bouts of activity or arousal (for example late-night gaming or social activity) that intrude on recovery windows.  
- Alcohol and sedentary leisure: weekly wine/liquor use (1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.94) and high time in sedentary hobbies (Z ≈ 2.01) are neutral-to-modest risk factors for higher perceived stress depending on context and coping patterns.

Integrated interpretation and likely drivers
The participant presents a profile of generally low self-reported psychological distress and multiple markers of physiological stability (stable circadian rhythm, robust amplitude, low resting HR), which are strong indicators of lower perceived stress relative to the study mean. Counterbalancing this are behavioral patterns concentrated in the late evening (late median sleep onset, pronounced midnight heart-rate elevation, high engagement in evening sedentary activities such as video gaming) and a modestly short nightly sleep duration. These evening-anchored behaviors appear to be the primary drivers of the stress-relevant signals in the wearable data — they may increase momentary physiological arousal and reduce total sleep opportunity, potentially limiting recovery even while subjective mood and trait measures remain favorable.

Conclusion and considerations
Overall, the data support an inference that this participant’s perceived stress is below the study population mean PSS score (i.e., “below the population mean”), with behavioral evening-arousal patterns representing the largest potential source of stress vulnerability. If the research aim is to identify modifiable behaviors that could further reduce stress vulnerability, attention to shifting late-evening stimulating activities earlier, modestly increasing total sleep time, and monitoring frequency/intensity of late-night arousal episodes would be reasonable next steps. Additional longitudinal or momentary sampling of subjective stress and situational context around the evening arousal windows would clarify whether those periods represent stimulating leisure, social interaction, or transient stressors."
35031,"Summary
Across modalities the participant presents a mixed profile: self-report symptom measures and functional indicators (low depressive symptoms, low trait anxiety, above-average self-esteem, adequate sleep duration and quality, good academic performance and substantial social time) point toward relatively low perceived stress, while wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian features (elevated resting heart rate, low interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, low circadian amplitude) indicate physiological arousal and circadian disorganization that have been associated with greater perceived stress. When these lines of evidence are considered together, the pattern is best described as psychologically well-functioning by self-report but physiologically showing signs that are often linked to higher stress. Relative to the study sample mean PSS (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), the participant’s overall inferred PSS level is near the population mean but with physiological indicators that suggest a tendency toward somewhat higher perceived stress than what the self-report measures alone would predict.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
Several wearable-derived metrics that correlate positively with PSS in the study sample suggest elevated stress-related physiology. Resting heart rate is high (75.5 bpm; Z = +2.06), and in this dataset resting heart rate has a positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.15), indicating that the participant’s tonic cardiovascular arousal is elevated relative to peers. Circadian rhythm measures show reduced rhythm robustness: interdaily stability is low (value = 0.19; Z = −1.81) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z ≈ −1.87), both of which in this sample are associated with higher perceived stress when rhythms are less regular. Intradaily variability is elevated (value = 0.71; Z = +1.16), a fragmentation measure that correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), suggesting more frequent transitions between activity states across the day. The cosinor amplitude is comparatively low (Z = −1.85), which—given its negative correlation with PSS in this sample—aligns with patterns seen in individuals with higher stress. The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations also show pronounced nocturnal minima and relatively high evening/night elevations, consistent with a shifted or blunted day–night cardiovascular pattern. Together these objective physiological signatures point toward greater autonomic/circadian perturbation, which typically accompanies elevated perceived stress.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Self-report mental-health and lifestyle indicators argue for lower perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score is low (6; Z ≈ −0.76; classified as “not depressed”) and trait anxiety on the STAI is low (27; Z ≈ −1.41), both of which would predict lower PSS given the positive correlations between these symptom scales and PSS in the sample. Self-esteem is above average (RSES Z = +0.68), and self-reported health satisfaction is slightly above the mean—both are features that tend to protect against perceived stress (self-esteem correlates modestly negatively with PSS in this sample). Sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality do not suggest sleep-related stress: median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 3 min; Z = +1.08) and PSQI indicates “good sleep” (score = 5; Z = −0.8). The participant reports frequent socializing (2–3 hours; Z ≈ +0.95), regular (albeit moderate) exercise, no recreational drug use, and only moderate alcohol consumption. These behavioral and subjective data points consistently indicate adaptive functioning and would be expected to correspond with lower perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the sample mean
Weighing the evidence across domains yields a nuanced conclusion. The self-report measures and sleep metrics provide clear evidence of low psychological distress and functional well‑being, which would predict a PSS below the sample mean. In contrast, multiple objective wearable markers of autonomic arousal and circadian instability (notably an elevated resting heart rate and low interdaily stability / high intradaily variability) are robust signals that—within this study’s correlations—associate with higher perceived stress. Because the self-report indicators (low CES-D/STAI, good sleep, good social engagement) are relatively strong and directly measure subjective experience (the same domain measured by the PSS), while the wearable metrics index physiological processes that can reflect stress but also other influences (e.g., fitness level, caffeine, transient illness, cardiorespiratory factors), the most conservative integrated inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study population mean, with a plausible lean toward higher-than-average physiological stress load. In summary: inferred perceived stress is near the population mean PSS (21.62), with wearable physiology suggesting a tendency in the direction of above-mean stress even though self-report symptom measures indicate lower-than-average psychological distress.

Key caveats
These inferences combine subjective and objective signals that do not always align; discrepancies may arise from differences in what is being measured (subjective perception versus physiological arousal), short-term versus trait factors, or non-stress causes of elevated heart rate or circadian disruption (e.g., low cardiorespiratory fitness, stimulants, recent illness, or schedule variability). The correlations provided in the dataset inform interpretation but are modest in magnitude; therefore conclusions about absolute PSS level should be treated as probabilistic rather than definitive."
88185,"Summary and overall comparison:
Taking the multimodal evidence together, the participant’s profile is more consistent with a perceived stress level below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62). Self-report measures of affective symptoms and trait anxiety are well below sample averages (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66; STAI-Trait = 29, Z = -1.22) and current happiness is relatively high (Happy = 5.0, Z = 1.64). Several wearable-derived circadian and activity markers that are negatively associated with PSS (e.g., high interdaily stability and large circadian amplitude) are also above the sample mean, which supports the inference of relatively lower perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Low depressive and anxiety symptomatology: The participant’s CES-D and STAI trait scores lie well below sample means and their correlations with PSS are positive but modest, suggesting these low symptom scores provide direct evidence for lower perceived stress.  
- Positive subjective well-being and social functioning: High current happiness (Z = 1.64), above-average trust (Z = 0.83), regular socializing (2–3 hours; Z = 0.95), and strong academic performance (GPAs in the high range) are behavioral and attitudinal indicators that typically align with lower perceived stress.  
- Healthy activity and physiological regularity: The wearable circadian summary shows relatively high interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33) and a relatively large HR amplitude (14.05, Z = 1.06). Both interdaily stability and amplitude correlate negatively with PSS in the cohort, which implies that the participant’s stable, high-amplitude heart-rate rhythm is associated with lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate is near the population mean/slightly lower (57.3 bpm, Z = -0.10), which is also consistent with lower chronic autonomic arousal. Regular exercise (exercised alone three times a week or more; Z = 1.07) and absence of substance use further align with lower stress risk.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Short and late-timed sleep with subjective disturbance: Median wearable sleep duration is modestly short (6 h 37 m, Z = -0.70) and the PSQI score is 6 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), indicating subjective sleep problems. The participant’s typical sleep start time is late (median ~02:25), which may contribute to sleep insufficiency and has been associated with higher perceived stress in some studies. Although sleep duration correlates weakly with PSS in the cohort, the combination of short sleep, late timing, and a PSQI above the common clinical cut-off constitutes a relevant stress-related risk.  
- Some signs of increased physiological arousal at early hours: Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show relatively larger positive correlations with PSS in early-morning hours (e.g., correlations ~0.19–0.21 for 3–7 am / 5–6 am windows), and modest positive correlations between resting/mean HR and PSS (resting HR correlation 0.14). While absolute resting HR is not elevated, these small positive associations suggest that nocturnal/early-morning arousal patterns could relate to increased perceived stress for individuals in the cohort.  
- Coping/behavior indicators with small positive associations to PSS: Listening to music is unusually high for this participant (more than 4 hours, Z = 2.06); while this may reflect adaptive coping or a lifestyle preference, it shows a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample and thus could reflect a strategy used in response to stress for some participants.

Synthesis and interpretive conclusion:
The preponderance of evidence points toward perceived stress lower than the study sample mean. Strong indicators are the participant’s low depressive and trait anxiety scores, elevated positive affect, regular circadian physiology (high interdaily stability and amplitude), frequent exercise, and absence of substance use — all of which are associated with lower PSS in the cohort. Countervailing signals are limited to sleep-related concerns (subjective sleep disturbance on PSQI, average nightly sleep under 7 hours, and a late sleep onset) and modest early-morning HR deviations that correlate positively with PSS; these factors could contribute to elevated momentary or situational stress even when global trait measures are low. Given this pattern, the most parsimonious interpretation is that the participant’s overall perceived stress is likely below the population mean but that sleep timing/quality and some nocturnal physiological arousal represent the principal targets that might increase perceived stress if they persist or worsen.

Notes on confidence and limitations:
This conclusion synthesizes cross-sectional self-report and aggregate wearable metrics and uses cohort-level correlations for context. Because the actual individual PSS score is not provided, the inference relies on convergent indicators rather than direct PSS measurement; correlations in the dataset are generally small to moderate, so interpretations should be regarded as probabilistic rather than definitive."
35344,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of clear psychological distress on self-report together with some behavioral and physiological features that are both risk- and resilience-related. Markers of chronic negative affect and sleep-related complaints are prominent (high trait anxiety, elevated depressive symptoms, low reported happiness, and a PSQI indicating disturbed sleep), while objective sleep duration, some circadian regularity metrics, and habitual exercise provide partial countervailing evidence. Taken together, the pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level that is above the study population mean.

Features that indicate relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety and depressive symptom burden: The participant’s STAI–Trait score is 62 (Z ≈ +2.05) and CES‑D is 28 (Z ≈ +1.53). Both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28). These large positive z-scores indicate substantial chronic anxiety proneness and elevated depressive symptoms, each of which is commonly associated with higher perceived stress.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and lower positive affect: The PSQI is 9 (Z ≈ +1.05), indicating clinically meaningful subjective sleep problems despite objectively adequate sleep time. Self-reported current happiness is low (value = 2, Z ≈ −1.61). Lower positive affect and worse perceived sleep quality typically accompany higher perceived stress.
- Low self-esteem and related psychosocial features: Rosenberg self‑esteem is relatively low (27, Z ≈ −1.57). Lower self‑esteem and reduced social/leisure engagement in this profile (limited time socializing, reading, and listening to music) are consistent with cognitive–behavioral patterns that can accompany elevated perceived stress.
- Physiologic indices consistent with increased arousal and fragmentation: Resting heart rate and circadian heart-rate features are modestly shifted upward (resting HR = 63.8, Z ≈ +0.67; MESOR = 78.0, Z ≈ +0.56) and intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.56, Z ≈ +0.10). These features have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (resting HR r ≈ 0.14; intradaily variability r ≈ 0.16), suggesting a tendency toward higher physiologic arousal and greater day-to-day fragmentation, which can accompany increased perceived stress.

Features that indicate relatively lower perceived stress or resilience
- Objective sleep duration and low napping: Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 47 min (Z ≈ +0.74), which is higher than the sample mean and generally consistent with adequate sleep quantity. Mean daily naps are effectively zero (Z ≈ −0.86). Longer objective sleep time and limited daytime napping can mitigate perceived stress and daytime fatigue.
- Circadian regularity and 24‑hour autocorrelation: Interdaily stability (0.44, Z ≈ +0.25) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.36, Z ≈ +0.31) indicate some preservation of regular daily structure in heart-rate rhythms. These non‑parametric features correlate negatively with PSS in this sample (r ≈ −0.12 and −0.17, respectively), suggesting that preserved day-to-day regularity is a modest protective factor against perceived stress.
- Habitual exercise and some health satisfaction: The participant reports exercising alone three times per week or more (Z ≈ +1.07) and a modestly positive health satisfaction score (4.56 on a 1–7 scale, Z ≈ +0.22). Regular physical activity and reasonable health satisfaction can protect against stress-related symptoms, even when other risk markers are present.
- Limited substance misuse and low recreational drug use: Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week) and no recreational or nonprescribed drug use is reported (small negative z‑scores). Absence of problematic substance use reduces one pathway by which stress can become compounded.

Wearable circadian/heart-rate pattern interpretation
- The cosinor and hourly heart-rate deviations show a typical nocturnal trough (large negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevations peaking in late morning and afternoon (positive deviations around 10–11am and mid‑afternoon). Amplitude is modest (11.25, Z ≈ +0.15) and acrophase is at ~3:51 PM. Overall, the heart‑rate rhythm is present and reasonably structured, but daytime heart-rate levels and a slightly elevated resting HR point to modestly raised autonomic tone. Interdaily stability and autocorrelation at 24 hours are slightly above average, while intradaily variability is slightly elevated; this combination suggests maintained daily scheduling but with some within‑day fragmentation or variability in activity/arousal, a pattern that can co-occur with heightened perceived stress but is not strongly dysregulated.

Holistic conclusion about perceived stress relative to the study sample
- Balancing the evidence, the self-report profile (very elevated trait anxiety and notable depressive symptoms, poor subjective sleep, low reported happiness, and low self‑esteem) exerts strong influence toward higher perceived stress. Wearable physiology and behavioral data provide mixed signals: objective sleep duration and some circadian regularity are protective, but slightly elevated resting HR and within-day variability align with the stress-related self-report indicators. Considering the magnitude of the psychological risk markers and their known relationships with PSS, the most defensible inference is that this participant’s perceived stress level is above the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61, SD = 3.68). Given the strength of anxiety and depressive symptom signals, the participant’s PSS is plausibly in the upper distribution (i.e., above the mean and possibly near or above the study 75th percentile), although the exact PSS score cannot be determined from the available summary data.

Notes and caveats
- Correlations provided in the dataset are sample associations and should be used as context rather than determinative proof; integrated interpretation relies on the combined pattern across self-report and wearable measures. The wearable metrics are aggregated across days and therefore cannot resolve acute day‑to‑day stress fluctuations."
31175,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mixture of signals. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59) and trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13; the STAI score positively correlates with PSS r ≈ 0.31), while depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) are in the nonclinical range and self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.40). Wearable-derived physiology shows a low overall heart-rate mesor (64.6 bpm, Z = -1.28) and a relatively low resting heart rate (57.8 bpm, Z = -0.04), with a clear daytime peak (acrophase ~3:34 PM) and pronounced daytime heart-rate deviations (largest around 2–5 PM). Circadian regularity measures are mixed: interdaily stability is near-sample-average (Z ≈ -0.16), intradaily variability is substantially lower than the sample (Z = -1.73), and amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is reduced (Z = -0.81). Sleep duration is long on average (median 9 h 34 min, Z = 2.96) but highly inconsistent across nights (sleep duration SD ≈ 249 min, Z = 3.37).

Evidence indicating relatively higher perceived stress: Several features that correlate positively with PSS and have nontrivial effect sizes point toward elevated perceived stress. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 8) is commonly associated with higher perceived stress and here has a positive PSS correlation; large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD Z = 3.37) suggests irregular sleep patterns that are often linked to stress and dysregulated daily routines. The reduced amplitude of the heart-rate circadian rhythm (amplitude Z = -0.81) and a lowered MESOR (Z = -1.28) have negative correlations with resilience/regularity and in this dataset are modestly associated with higher PSS (amplitude r ≈ -0.16). The participant’s current self-reported happiness is below average (Z = -0.53; correlation with PSS r ≈ -0.19), and trait anxiety shows a positive relationship to PSS (STAI correlation r ≈ 0.31). Together, subjective sleep problems, high sleep variability, blunted circadian amplitude, and the presence of anxiety-prone traits are the strongest cluster of indicators that align with a higher perceived stress profile.

Evidence indicating relatively lower perceived stress: Several behavioral and physiological signals likely offset some stress-related risk. Objective cardiac markers indicate relatively low tonic cardiovascular arousal (low mesor and low resting HR), which typically maps onto lower stress-linked autonomic activation (resting HR correlation with PSS is small but positive, so a lower value is protective here). Intradaily variability (activity/HR fragmentation) is well below the sample average (Z = -1.73), indicating relatively consolidated day–night structure within days; lower intradaily variability in this dataset is associated with lower PSS. The participant reports frequent exercise and sports participation (exercising three times per week or more; sports Z = 1.58), and high levels of socializing (social time Z = 1.74), both behaviors typically buffer stress and have small-to-modest associations with lower perceived stress in the study correlations. Self-esteem is slightly above average (RSES Z = 0.40), which has a small inverse correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.15). Depressive symptoms are not elevated (CES-D in the nonclinical range), and recreational drug use is absent—both factors that reduce the likelihood of a markedly elevated perceived-stress score.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the participant demonstrates both notable stress-risk signals (subjective sleep disturbance, very large night-to-night sleep variability, blunted circadian amplitude, and some trait anxiety) and protective signals (low resting HR and mesor, low intradaily variability, frequent exercise and social engagement, and above-average self-esteem). On balance, these patterns are most consistent with a perceived stress level slightly above the study sample mean rather than markedly elevated or well below average. Relative to the study population mean PSS of 21.61 (SD = 3.68), the profile is best described as somewhat above the population mean (i.e., modestly elevated perceived stress), with sleep irregularity and subjective sleep problems being the most prominent contributors to that inference.

Caveats: This inference integrates correlational signals across modalities rather than a direct PSS score; many correlations are small-to-moderate and individual data points (e.g., long median sleep with very high variability) can have complex, sometimes opposing implications. Where causal interpretation would be required (e.g., whether sleep problems drive stress or vice versa), the data do not allow firm conclusions."
58793,"Summary
The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals: trait anxiety and some behavioral/physiological markers that can be interpreted as stress-related co-occur with robust sleep, regular circadian structure, frequent exercise, and social engagement that are typically stress-buffering. Self-report and wearable indices point to episodic physiological arousal during the day (large morning and late-afternoon heart-rate elevations) but generally low resting heart rate and long, subjectively good sleep. Taken together, these features are most consistent with a perceived stress level around the study sample average (the study mean PSS = 21.62), likely within one standard deviation of the mean and plausibly slightly above the mean but not extreme.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 46, Z ≈ 0.46) is moderately elevated relative to the sample and has a positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.31). This indicates a stable propensity toward anxious responding that tends to co-occur with higher perceived stress.  
- Relatively low self-esteem (Rosenberg = 33, Z ≈ −0.73) and lower self-reported current happiness (score 3.0, Z ≈ −0.53) are psychosocial features associated in the literature with greater perceived stress; here self-esteem has a small negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ −0.15) and happiness shows a modest negative relation as well.  
- Some measures of circadian fragmentation are modestly elevated: intradaily variability (0.61, Z ≈ 0.46) indicates greater within-day rhythm fragmentation and shows a small positive correlation with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.16). Episodes of higher physiological arousal at particular times (notably a very large aggregated heart-rate deviation around 8–9 AM: +30.3 bpm, Z ≈ 3.52, and a pronounced late-afternoon elevation around 4–5 PM: +22.3 bpm, Z ≈ 2.0) could reflect recurring acute stressors or demanding periods of activity that align with higher perceived stress when they are frequent or perceived as threatening.  
- Resting heart rate has a small positive correlation with PSS (resting HR = 58.7 bpm, Z ≈ 0.07; r ≈ 0.14), which means small elevations in tonic cardiovascular arousal in this cohort are associated with greater perceived stress. Although this participant’s resting HR is not high in absolute terms, the association suggests physiological arousal should be considered alongside subjective anxiety.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Sleep quantity and subjective sleep quality are prominent strengths. Median nightly sleep duration is long (median = 9 hours 2 minutes, Z ≈ 2.3), and the PSQI score (5.0, Z ≈ −0.8) classifies the participant at the threshold of “good sleep” by standard scoring. Longer, regular sleep and a relatively low PSQI are generally associated with lower perceived stress (the sleep duration correlation with PSS here is small and negative to negligible, but conceptually long restorative sleep is a buffer). Nighttime heart-rate deviations show large nocturnal dips (substantially negative deviations across early morning hours), consistent with physiologic rest and recovery during sleep.  
- Circadian robustness: amplitude is relatively large (13.88, Z ≈ 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.45, Z ≈ 1.06), indicating a strong and repeatable 24-hour rhythm. In this dataset amplitude and interdaily stability have weak negative correlations with PSS (e.g., amplitude r ≈ −0.16), suggesting stronger circadian structure is associated with lower perceived stress.  
- Behavioral and social resources: frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; exercise Z-scores ≈ 1.07 and 1.23) and high time socializing with friends (3–4 hours/day, Z ≈ 1.74) are behavioral patterns typically linked to resilience and lower perceived stress. The participant also reports high health satisfaction (score 6/7, Z ≈ 1.3), and academic performance is strong (GPAs in the high 3.6–3.8 range), which can reflect effective functioning and resources for stress management. Alcohol and other substance use are low-to-moderate and are not prominent risk signals in this profile.

Circadian and wearable-specific interpretation
- Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced morning peak (8–9 AM) and secondary late-afternoon peak (4–5 PM). These spikes have large positive Z-scores and likely reflect recurring periods of elevated activity or arousal (e.g., commuting, classes, exercise, or work demands). Because these hourly values are aggregated across days, they indicate stable time-of-day elevations rather than isolated events. The nocturnal heart-rate troughs and long sleep duration indicate good overnight recovery.  
- Global circadian measures present a mixed but overall orderly pattern: interdaily stability is near the sample mean (0.42, Z ≈ 0.09) while intradaily variability is modestly elevated; combined with a high amplitude and substantial 24-hour autocorrelation, this suggests a generally regular rhythm with some within-day irregularities—consistent with scheduled demands producing predictable arousal periods amid otherwise stable routines.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study sample
Balancing the evidence, the participant shows both stress-promoting features (elevated trait anxiety, episodic daytime physiological arousal, some intraday rhythm fragmentation, lower self-reported happiness/self-esteem) and stress-buffering features (long restorative sleep, strong circadian amplitude and 24-hour regularity, frequent exercise, social engagement, high health satisfaction, and good academic functioning). These mixed signals suggest perceived stress that is not extreme. Relative to the study sample mean PSS of 21.62 (SD = 3.68), the data are most consistent with a perceived stress level near the population mean—likely within one standard deviation, and possibly modestly above the mean owing chiefly to the elevated trait anxiety and daytime arousal patterns. This inference emphasizes probabilistic interpretation: several protective behavioral and physiological factors reduce the likelihood of very high perceived stress, while dispositional anxiety and repeated daytime arousal increase the likelihood of somewhat elevated perceived stress relative to peers.

Caveats
- Correlations provided in the dataset are descriptive and modest in magnitude; they guide interpretation but do not determine individual-level stress.  
- The heart-rate hourly values are aggregated across days and cannot identify which specific events (exercise, classes, or stressors) generate the observed peaks.  
- Self-report measures represent snapshots and may differ from momentary experience; physiological measures provide complementary but not definitive evidence of subjective stress."
96689,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile contains a mix of signals that point in opposing directions for perceived stress. Self-report trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56, correlation with PSS ≈ +0.31) and a PSQI sleep-quality score above the clinical cutoff (PSQI = 6) are the clearest self-report indicators that would be expected to contribute to higher perceived stress. In contrast, low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = −0.76), relatively high self‑esteem (RSES = 39), regular and adequate wearable-measured sleep (median 7 h 18 min, low night-to-night variability), a pronounced circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = +1.36, correlation with PSS ≈ −0.16), and low resting heart rate (58.8 bpm) are features that tend to align with lower perceived stress or greater physiological resilience.

Features suggesting relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score of 47 (Z ≈ +0.56) is one of the strongest psychological correlates in this dataset and has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ +0.31). This indicates a stable tendency toward anxiety proneness that would be expected to raise perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: PSQI = 6 exceeds the common threshold for clinically meaningful sleep disturbance; disturbed subjective sleep commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress.  
- Reduced positive affect / health satisfaction: Current self-rated happiness is below average (3.0, Z ≈ −0.53) and overall health satisfaction is low (2.11, Z ≈ −1.61). Lower positive mood and low satisfaction with physical health are both plausibly associated with elevated stress experience.  
- Low physical activity: The participant reports essentially no exercise (exercise frequencies Z ≤ −1.9), removing a common behavioral buffer against stress; although the direct correlations here in the sample are small, lack of exercise is conceptually and empirically linked to higher perceived stress and poorer stress regulation.

Features suggesting relatively lower perceived stress
- Low depressive symptom burden and good self‑esteem: A low CES‑D (6; Z ≈ −0.76) and high self‑esteem (RSES 39) both argue against an overall high symptom burden and are associated (in the sample) with lower PSS.  
- Stable, adequate sleep and structured circadian physiology: Wearable sleep shows a median sleep duration around 7 h 18 min (near sample mean) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD Z ≈ −1.42 and sleep-start SD Z ≈ −1.19), indicating consistent sleep timing and duration. Objective circadian metrics show a strong amplitude (Z ≈ +1.36) and above-average interdaily stability/autocorrelation (interdaily stability Z ≈ +0.75; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ +0.98). These objective rhythm features correlate negatively with PSS in the sample (amplitude r ≈ −0.16, autocorrelation r ≈ −0.17), so the participant’s robust day–night cardiac rhythm and consistent sleep schedule are likely protective against perceived stress.  
- Social engagement and limited substance use: Self-reported socializing (2–3 hours, Z ≈ +0.95) is relatively high and substance use is absent; these behavioral patterns are more consistent with social resources and absence of substance-related coping, factors that tend to reduce stress exposure or reactivity.  
- Clear day–night physiological separation: The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced low values across the overnight hours and marked evening elevations with an acrophase around 5:14 PM and large evening deviations (e.g., 6–9 PM with Z-scores > +1). The combination of low nocturnal cardiac levels and strong daytime/evening peaks corresponds to a high circadian amplitude and is associated in this sample with lower PSS.

Integrative interpretation and comparison to the study mean PSS
Weighing the evidence, the strongest single indicator of higher perceived stress is the elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and the presence of subjectively disturbed sleep; these both have relatively larger sample correlations with PSS than many other measures. However, several objectively measured behavioral and physiological markers (robust circadian amplitude and stability, consistent nightly sleep duration, low resting heart rate, social time, low depressive symptoms, and high self‑esteem) are potent countervailing signals that typically correspond with lower perceived stress. Overall, the balance of multimodal signals suggests that the participant’s perceived stress is likely close to, but somewhat above, the study population mean—i.e., slightly above the population mean PSS (population mean PSS = 21.62, SD = 3.68). This characterization reflects a mixture of risk-related subjective traits (notably anxiety and self-reported sleep disturbance) combined with objective physiological and social resources that temper the expected stress burden.

Clinical/scientific implications (brief)
- The elevated trait anxiety and PSQI > 5 are the most salient targets if the aim is to reduce perceived stress. Interventions that improve subjective sleep quality and teach anxiety management skills could be expected to have meaningful effects.  
- The participant’s stable sleep schedule, strong circadian amplitude, social time, and low depressive symptoms are strengths that could be leveraged in behavioral interventions (e.g., sleep hygiene, scheduled social/physical activities).  
- Lack of exercise is a modifiable behavior that, if increased, could further reduce stress vulnerability.

If you would like, I can (a) estimate a more formal predicted PSS score using a weighted model of the correlates provided, (b) produce a short action plan focused on sleep and anxiety management tailored to these data, or (c) visualize key wearable-versus-self-report contrasts."
33657,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile presents a mix of signals: self-report measures show modest depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 16, z = 0.28) together with comparatively lower trait anxiety (STAI trait = 37, z = −0.43) and relatively high self‑reported happiness and self‑esteem (happy z = 0.55; self‑esteem z = 0.4). Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a generally low average cardiovascular set point (mesor and resting heart rate both below the study mean, mesor z = −1.46; resting HR z = −0.83) but also evidence of circadian irregularity and within‑day fragmentation (reduced interdaily stability z = −0.49 and elevated intradaily variability z = 0.74). Subjective sleep quality is flagged as disturbed on the PSQI (score = 6), while objective sleep duration is near the cohort median (median ≈ 7 h 5 min, z = −0.13) with relatively low night‑to‑night duration variability (SD z = −0.85). Taking all sources into account, the pattern suggests neither unequivocally low nor extreme perceived stress; overall the evidence best supports an inferred perceived stress level near the study population mean PSS (population mean PSS = 21.62).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: 
- Depressive symptom burden is elevated relative to the sample mean (CES‑D z = 0.28) and CES‑D shows a positive correlation with PSS in this dataset, which supports greater perceived stress when present. 
- Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) is commonly associated with higher stress and negative affect, and sleep disturbance often amplifies perceived stress even when total sleep time is adequate. 
- Circadian rhythm metrics indicate reduced day‑to‑day regularity and increased fragmentation (interdaily stability z = −0.49; intradaily variability z = 0.74). In this cohort intradaily variability is positively correlated with PSS, implying that within‑day fragmentation of activity/physiology is a plausible contributor to higher perceived stress. 
- Wearable data show an unusually large positive deviation from mesor at 10–11am (HR deviation z = 2.71), suggesting pronounced physiological arousal during that hour; such acute, recurring daytime spikes can reflect recurrent stressors, task‑related arousal, or sympathetic activation tied to daily responsibilities. 
- Relatively frequent naps (mean daily naps 0.26, z = 2.23) combined with sedentary leisure time (sedentary hobby z = 3.19) are behaviors that often co‑occur with higher subjective distress or coping patterns that do not reduce perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Trait anxiety proneness is below the cohort mean (STAI trait z = −0.43) and trait anxiety shows a positive correlation with PSS; lower trait anxiety therefore argues against substantially elevated perceived stress. 
- Self‑reported positive indicators — higher self‑esteem (z = 0.4), above‑average current happiness (z = 0.55), and modestly positive health satisfaction (z = 0.22) — are all negatively correlated with PSS in the sample, consistent with lower perceived stress. 
- Objective cardiovascular baseline measures are reduced (mesor and resting HR both below mean), which in many contexts signals good cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic sympathetic tone rather than high chronic stress. 
- Nightly sleep duration is close to the cohort typical value and night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration is relatively low, both of which are protective features against heightened perceived stress even though subjective sleep quality is somewhat disturbed.

Circadian and heart‑rate pattern interpretation:
- Cosinor and non‑parametric rhythm metrics together describe a rhythm with a clear mid‑afternoon acrophase (~3:16 PM) but reduced amplitude and reduced 24‑hour regularity. Lower amplitude (z = −1.18) suggests blunted day–night differences in heart rate, which can reflect either high fitness/low baseline sympathetic activity or an attenuated circadian drive; in this dataset lower amplitude correlates weakly with lower PSS but the intradaily variability and reduced interdaily stability (opposite directions) better implicate schedule irregularity and within‑day fragmentation as stress‑related. 
- Overnight deviations from mesor are large and negative (expected nocturnal heart‑rate nadir), indicating intact nocturnal cardiovascular down‑regulation; however, the pronounced daytime spike around 10–11am stands out as a temporal locus of elevated physiological arousal that could reflect recurring cognitive or environmental demands (e.g., classes, deadlines) and is a plausible contributor to perceived stress.

Holistic assessment and relative comparison:
Balancing the signals, this participant exhibits a mixture of protective and risk features for perceived stress. Protective indicators (lower trait anxiety, higher self‑esteem and happiness, low resting heart rate, typical sleep duration) offset risk indicators (elevated depressive symptoms, subjective sleep disturbance, circadian fragmentation, frequent naps, and a pronounced mid‑morning HR spike). Given the moderate magnitude of the risk signals and the relatively strong protective signals, the best summary is that the participant’s inferred perceived stress is near the study population mean rather than clearly above or below it. In other words, their overall profile is consistent with a PSS level close to the cohort mean of 21.62, with specific targets for monitoring or intervention being subjective sleep quality, day‑to‑day schedule regularity, and the recurrent mid‑morning physiological arousal."
36117,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile is mixed but leans toward features consistent with lower-than-average perceived stress. Objectively, the wearable-derived circadian rhythm shows marked regularity and robustness (interdaily stability = 0.55, Z = +1.16; amplitude = 15.67, Z = +1.58; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = +1.23), and median nightly sleep duration is within a healthy range (7 h 39 min, Z = +0.58). Subjective well-being indices are also favorable: high self-reported current happiness (Z = +1.64), elevated trust in others (Z = +1.79), and relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = +0.96). Several of these features (higher amplitude and interdaily stability, greater happiness and self-esteem, and more social time) are associated in the study with lower PSS scores and together point toward comparatively lower perceived stress.

Features that suggest relatively higher perceived stress: The participant reports clinically meaningful sleep disturbance on the PSQI (score = 8, Z = +0.59) despite adequate objective sleep duration, suggesting subjective sleep problems or sleep-related distress that can elevate perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden is non-trivial (CES-D = 16, Z = +0.28; classified as “Depressed” on that instrument), and CES-D scores in this sample correlate positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.28), indicating this symptom set could contribute to higher perceived stress. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mesor are elevated (resting HR = 72 bpm, Z = +1.65; mesor = 88.9, Z = +2.04) and show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (resting HR r ≈ +0.14), which is consistent with greater tonic autonomic arousal that can accompany higher stress. Behavioral patterns that can reflect or sustain stress—high daily internet use (more than 4 hours, Z = +2.19), very large amounts of sedentary hobby time (Z = +3.19), and late median sleep onset (01:13 AM with SD ≈ 100 minutes)—also weigh toward increased perceived stress or maladaptive coping for some individuals.

Features that suggest relatively lower perceived stress: Several behavioral and rhythm markers point the other way. The participant reports substantial socializing time (more than 4 hours daily, Z = +2.53), regular exercise with others (three times per week or more, Z = +1.23), and high subjective happiness and trust; these social and affective resources are associated with lower PSS in the study (small negative correlations). Objective circadian regularity and amplitude (both Z > +1.1) are associated with lower PSS in this sample (amplitude r ≈ −0.17; interdaily stability r ≈ −0.12), implying that the participant’s structured daily rhythm and robust day–night heart rate contrast are protective against perceived stress. Median sleep duration is adequate and sleep variability is within typical bounds (sleep SD = 93 min, Z ≈ −0.18), which supports physiological recovery even when subjective sleep quality is reported as disturbed.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample: Balancing the evidence, the profile contains both risk indicators (subjective sleep disturbance, modest depressive symptoms, elevated resting heart rate/mesor, high sedentary and internet use, late and variable sleep timing) and protective indicators (strong circadian regularity and amplitude, adequate sleep duration, high social engagement, elevated happiness and trust, higher self-esteem). The protective set—particularly the robust circadian organization, high social engagement, and positive affect—appear prominent and are features that in this sample are meaningfully associated with lower PSS. On balance, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is likely below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). This inference should be treated as provisional: several markers tied to higher PSS (notably the PSQI and CES-D) merit clinical or investigational follow-up, and the small-to-moderate effect sizes of many correlations mean uncertainty remains."
92515,"Indicators consistent with relatively higher perceived stress are present primarily in the sleep and sleep-timing data. Wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration was 5 hours 55 minutes (Z = -1.58), and the PSQI score is 6 (classified as disturbed sleep), which together indicate objectively short and subjectively disturbed sleep across the semester. The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (≈02:57 AM) with moderately elevated night-to-night variability in sleep onset (sleep start SD ≈110 minutes, Z = 0.59); late and irregular sleep schedules are commonly associated with greater perceived stress or impaired recovery. A few circadian/HR features also modestly point toward stress-related physiology: a reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude = 9.67, Z = -0.36) and several early-morning heart-rate deviations that correlate positively with PSS in the sample (early-morning hourly deviations show small positive correlations with PSS, r ≈ 0.19–0.22). Taken together, the sleep restriction, late/variable sleep timing, and subtle blunting of HR circadian amplitude are the strongest objective indicators in this profile that could be associated with elevated perceived stress.

By contrast, multiple self-report and physiological markers point toward relatively lower perceived stress. Symptom measures of mood and trait anxiety are low: CES-D = 4 (Z = -0.97; classified as not depressed) and STAI–Trait = 36 (Z = -0.52; classified as not anxious). Positive psychological resources are also notable: self-esteem is above average (RSES Z ≈ 0.4) and current happiness is substantially above the sample mean (happiness Z = 1.64). Academic functioning is strong (multiple term GPAs = 4.0), alcohol and drug use are modest, and the participant reports only limited use of solitary exercise (exercise-with-others and sports occur with moderate frequency). Physiologically, resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, Z = -0.26), and non-parametric circadian regularity metrics are not strongly disrupted (interdaily stability Z ≈ 0.09; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ 0.73), which together suggest preserved day-to-day regularity and cardiovascular fitness rather than a pattern of chronic autonomic arousal.

Examining the wearable circadian/heart-rate pattern yields a mixed but mostly coherent picture: the participant shows a typical afternoon acrophase (peak HR ≈ 4:43 PM) and clear daytime increases in HR (largest positive deviations midday), indicating preserved circadian modulation of cardiovascular activity. The amplitude is somewhat attenuated and the mesor/resting HR are slightly below sample mean, consistent with relatively low baseline sympathetic tone. Intradaily variability is not elevated (Z ≈ -0.11), and the 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively high (Z ≈ 0.73), both of which are more consistent with stable daily structure than with chaotic or highly fragmented rhythms. Thus, despite short sleep, the overall heart-rate rhythm retains regularity—an element that tends to protect against sustained perceived stress.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: weighing the evidence, the participant displays a combination of risk and protective features. The strongest risk signal is objectively and subjectively reduced and irregular sleep, which is often linked to higher perceived stress; however, multiple robust protective signals—low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high reported happiness and self-esteem, excellent academic performance, low resting heart rate, and preserved circadian regularity—argue against substantially elevated perceived stress. Considering these factors and the direction/magnitude of relevant z-scores, the most defensible summary is that the participant’s inferred perceived stress is near to, and more likely slightly below, the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). In other words, this profile does not suggest markedly higher-than-average perceived stress in this cohort, though the short and late sleep pattern represents a clear target for monitoring because it could contribute to increased stress or functional impairment over time if it persists or worsens.

Uncertainties and caveats: correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the sample are generally small-to-moderate, so inferences about perceived stress remain probabilistic. Self-report measures and wearable signals can reflect different constructs (subjective distress vs. objective physiology/behavior), and the late sleep timing may reflect chronotype or schedule demands rather than stress per se. If the goal is to reduce future risk, improving sleep duration and timing stability would be the most direct behavioral target."
49790,"Summary overview: Across self-report and wearable-derived data there is a mixed signal. Objective physiology and circadian metrics show elevations and irregularity that are commonly associated with greater allostatic load and perceived stress, while standard self-report measures of mood and trait anxiety are on the low side and several psychosocial resources (self-esteem, health satisfaction, academic performance) are relatively strong. Integrating these modalities suggests the participant’s perceived stress level is not clearly extreme in either direction; it appears near the study population mean PSS, with some evidence that it may be modestly elevated relative to that mean.

Features that point toward relatively higher perceived stress:
- Elevated basal cardiovascular tone: resting heart rate (75.7 bpm, Z ≈ +2.09) and MESOR (88.8, Z ≈ +2.03) are both high relative to the sample. Higher resting/circadian mean heart rate is frequently linked with physiological arousal and modestly positively correlated here with PSS (r ≈ 0.14 for RHR), supporting greater stress-related activation.
- Circadian irregularity and reduced rhythmic stability: interdaily stability (0.25, Z ≈ −1.32) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z ≈ −1.54) indicate a less regular day-to-day heart-rate rhythm. Irregular daily structure is commonly associated with worse stress and poorer sleep health and shows weak negative/positive correlations with PSS in this dataset.
- Sleep timing irregularity and subjective disturbance: the participant’s median sleep onset is very late (≈ 02:18) with high night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z ≈ +1.89), and the PSQI score is in the disturbed-sleep range (PSQI = 7). Late and variable sleep timing together with poorer subjective sleep quality are commonly linked to higher perceived stress.
- Elevated evening physiological arousal: aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show relatively large evening elevations (peak ≈ +12 bpm around 6–7 pm), and amplitude of the circadian rhythm is somewhat blunted (amplitude Z ≈ −0.97). Evening peaks and blunted amplitude can reflect atypical activity/arousal patterns that co-occur with stress-related dysregulation.

Features that point toward relatively lower perceived stress:
- Low self-reported depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 3 (Z ≈ −1.07) and STAI-Trait = 27 (Z ≈ −1.41) are well below sample averages, which typically predict lower perceived stress.
- Psychosocial resources and functioning: higher self-esteem (Z ≈ +1.1), above-average health satisfaction (Z ≈ +1.22), and consistently strong academic performance (GPAs in the mid-3.0s) are all protective factors that tend to be associated with lower perceived stress.
- Minimal problematic substance use and some regular exercise/socialization: low recreational drug use, only occasional alcohol use, and modest frequency of exercise (1–2×/week) reduce behavioral risk for elevated PSS in group-level analyses.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean: The participant exhibits a split profile — robust self-reported psychological well-being and social/functional resources co-occurring with objective signs of physiological arousal and circadian/sleep irregularity. Because the objective physiological markers (particularly elevated resting heart rate and circadian instability) are moderately pronounced (Z-scores ≈ +2 for RHR and MESOR; Z ≈ −1.3 to −1.5 for stability metrics) and are established correlates of perceived stress, they add weight toward a conclusion of at least some elevated stress. However, the strong protective signal from low depressive/anxiety symptoms and higher self-esteem argues against a high PSS far above the sample mean.

Given this balance, the most defensible statement is that the participant’s perceived stress level is near the study sample mean PSS (sample mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), with a modest tendency toward being elevated rather than clearly below average. Put another way, the participant’s profile is consistent with a PSS close to the central range of the sample distribution (within roughly one standard deviation of the mean), though physiological evidence suggests monitoring for increasing perceived stress or emerging sleep/circadian dysfunction.

Clinical/research implications to consider: the discordance between low self-reported mood/anxiety and objective physiological markers suggests either (a) compensatory resilience and resources are buffering subjective distress despite physiological strain, or (b) subjective under-reporting or limited insight into stress-related arousal. For longitudinal follow-up, sleep timing regularity, resting heart rate/MESOR, and interdaily stability are the most salient wearable markers to track alongside repeated PSS assessments to detect changes in perceived stress over time."
78657,"Summary: Integrating self-report, wearable-derived physiology, and behavioral habit data yields a mixed picture. On symptom inventories the participant scores below the study average for depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, z = -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, z = -0.33), and reports relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 39, z = 0.11). At the same time the participant reports objectively disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI = 7) and low satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction = 2.22, z = -1.53). Wearable data show a strongly delayed and irregular sleep/circadian profile (median sleep start ~03:38; median sleep duration 6 h 30 min, z = -0.85) with elevated night-to-night variability (sleep start SD z = 0.88) and reduced day-to-day regularity in heart-rate rhythms (interdaily stability = 0.31, z = -0.82) combined with relatively high fragmentation within days (intradaily variability = 0.67, z = 0.88). These converging signals point to behavioral circadian irregularity and sleep disturbance as the most salient physiobehavioral features.

Evidence that is consistent with comparatively higher perceived stress: disturbed and irregular sleep timing (PSQI >5; late median sleep start and elevated sleep start SD) and higher intradaily variability are each modestly positively associated with PSS in this dataset (sleep start SD correlation ≈ 0.18; intradaily variability correlation ≈ 0.16), and the participant shows elevated evening physiological arousal (large positive mean heart-rate deviations in evening hours; e.g., 7–8 pm deviation value = 20.28, z = 1.53). Low self-rated health satisfaction (z = -1.53) and below-average momentary happiness (current happiness z = -0.53) are additional self-report features that, in combination with the sleep/circadian profile, commonly co-occur with higher perceived stress. These factors, especially the objectively measured circadian fragmentation and late-night arousal, weigh toward an interpretation of elevated stress-related burden.

Evidence that is consistent with comparatively lower perceived stress: trait symptom measures and many lifestyle markers argue against a high-stress interpretation. CES-D and STAI scores are below the study mean (z = -0.14 and -0.33 respectively), self-esteem is slightly above average (z = 0.11), and the participant engages in regular exercise (exercising alone and with others three+ times per week; z ≈ 1.1–1.2) and moderate socializing (2–3 hours, z ≈ 0.95). Resting heart rate and MESOR are lower than the cohort mean (resting HR = 53.4 bpm, z = -0.56; MESOR z = -0.7), which can reflect good cardiovascular fitness and is not in itself an index of high perceived stress. Alcohol and other substance use are moderate or absent. These behavioral and symptom indicators temper an interpretation of high perceived stress.

Physiological/circadian integration: the cosinor and hourly heart-rate deviations indicate a compressed pattern of arousal with a late evening peak (acrophase ~6:50 PM) and pronounced dips across the early morning hours. The combination of a late habitual sleep onset (~03:38), reduced interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability suggests irregular daily scheduling and evening-concentrated activity/arousal. This physiological-temporal pattern plausibly explains the participant’s subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) and is a plausible mechanistic pathway linking daily behavior to perceived stress, even while resting HR and general fitness markers appear favorable.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study sample mean PSS: weighing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile: protective features (lower trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, good self-esteem, regular exercise and social contact, lower resting heart rate) coexist with circadian-sleep dysregulation, lower health satisfaction, and evening physiological arousal—features that are modestly associated with higher PSS in this sample. Overall, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress is near the population mean and possibly slightly above it rather than clearly below or markedly elevated. Compared to the study sample mean PSS of 21.63 (SD = 3.67), the data support an inference of perceived stress ""near the mean"" with a modest tilt toward ""slightly above the mean,"" driven principally by disturbed and irregular sleep/circadian markers."
48154,"Summary: The multi-modal profile for this participant shows a predominance of markers that, in this sample, are associated with lower perceived stress, with a smaller set of wearable-derived circadian features that point in the opposite direction. Self-report measures indicate low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 30, Z = -1.12), relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66) and current happiness (Z = 1.64), and generally good subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 5, Z = -0.80). Objective sleep metrics corroborate subjective sleep: median nightly sleep of about 8 h 3 min (Z = 1.08) with only moderate night-to-night variability (sleep SD 64 min, Z = -0.85). The participant also reports regular physical activity (exercising alone three+ times per week, Z = 1.07) and limited substance use. Taken together, these psychosocial and behavioral findings are most consistent with a lower-than-average burden of perceived stress in this study sample.

Evidence pointing toward lower perceived stress
- Low affective symptom burden: CES-D and STAI scores are both well below the sample mean (Z ≈ -1.1 for each). In this dataset those instruments show modest positive correlations with PSS (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), so the participant’s low scores on these scales are a meaningful indicator of relatively lower perceived stress.
- Positive self-evaluations and wellbeing: High self-esteem (Z = 1.66) and above-average reported happiness (Z = 1.64) are associated in the sample with lower PSS (self-esteem correlation with PSS ≈ -0.15; happiness correlation ≈ -0.19). These magnitudes are not large, but together with low symptom scores they form a consistent psychological picture.
- Healthy behavioral patterns: Objective and subjective sleep are favorable (longer median sleep duration, good PSQI), regular exercise frequency is above the sample mean, and resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, Z = -0.26), which commonly tracks with better fitness and lower tonic physiological arousal. These factors align with lower perceived stress in the sample.

Evidence pointing toward higher perceived stress
- Reduced circadian regularity: Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms is low (value 0.26, Z = -1.23). In this dataset interdaily stability correlates negatively with PSS (r ≈ -0.12), meaning lower stability is modestly associated with higher perceived stress. This is one of the clearer wearable signals that could point toward greater stress-related disruption of daily structure.
- Mildly elevated intraday variability and blunted amplitude: Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.10) and the cosinor amplitude is below average (amplitude Z = -0.71). In this sample higher intradaily variability correlates with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.16) and lower amplitude has a modest negative correlation with stress (r ≈ -0.17), so these features could reflect a somewhat more fragmented or blunted circadian physiology that has been linked to greater perceived stress.
- Late sleep timing: Median sleep start time around 01:03 AM is later than typical circadian timing for some participants. Late sleep timing alone is not a large correlate of PSS here, but, combined with reduced interdaily stability it may reflect a daily schedule that is less regular—one potential stress-relevant behavioral pattern.

Wearable heart-rate pattern interpretation
- The participant’s aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nighttime decreases (large negative deviations during 2–7 AM) and marked evening elevations, notably a strong peak around 5–6 PM (value 18.24, Z = 1.13). The evening peak could reflect an exercise or activity bout (consistent with reported exercise frequency) rather than chronic physiological hyperarousal. Resting heart rate and mesor are both below the sample mean (RHR Z = -0.26; MESOR Z = -0.78), which overall favors a profile of lower tonic cardiovascular arousal despite the circadian irregularities.

Holistic conclusion regarding perceived stress relative to the study population mean
- On balance, the preponderance of evidence (low CES-D and STAI, high self-esteem and happiness, good subjective and objective sleep duration, regular exercise, low resting HR) supports the inference that this participant’s perceived stress is below the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). The wearable-derived circadian irregularities (low interdaily stability, slightly elevated intraday variability, lower amplitude, and late sleep timing) constitute credible countervailing signals that could modestly raise perceived stress risk, but their effect sizes and correlations with PSS in this sample are relatively small compared with the stronger self-report indicators of low symptoms and high wellbeing. Therefore the most defensible statement is that inferred perceived stress is below the population mean, while noting there are physiologic/circadian features that merit monitoring for potential future stress-related change.

Limitations
- Correlations reported in the dataset are modest; none of these indicators alone determine perceived stress. Self-report and wearable signals provide complementary but not definitive information. Temporal causality cannot be established from these cross-sectional/aggregated metrics, and some measurement scales and normative ranges differ across instruments."
21793,"Summary: Integrating the self-report and wearable-derived data yields a mixed but coherent pattern in which markers of disrupted sleep timing and circadian irregularity, together with elevated trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance, point toward greater perceived stress; conversely, low resting heart rate, limited substance use, and moderate self-reported health satisfaction argue against very high stress. On balance, the profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level above the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.6), driven primarily by sleep/circadian dysregulation and anxiety-prone traits.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Sleep and sleep timing: The participant reports poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 9, Z = +1.05, classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), and wearable data show short median nightly sleep duration (6 h 9 min, Z = -1.29) with large variability in sleep start time (median start 03:36:45; start-time SD Z = +1.04). Large sleep-timing variability and elevated PSQI are commonly associated with higher perceived stress; here the sleep-start variability shows a modest positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16). Frequent napping (mean daily naps 0.33, Z = +3.05) also co-occurs with the disturbed nocturnal sleep pattern and weakly correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ 0.12).
- Circadian irregularity and activity fragmentation: Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate low day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.17, Z = -1.98) and elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.68, Z = +0.95). Low interdaily stability and higher IV reflect an irregular, fragmented 24-hour pattern; both metrics have modest correlations with stress in this dataset (interdaily stability r ≈ -0.11, IV r ≈ +0.16), supporting an interpretation that disrupted circadian structure relates to greater perceived stress for this participant.
- Trait anxiety and mood-related self-report: Trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = +0.17) is elevated relative to the sample mean and shows one of the strongest survey correlations with PSS in the dataset (r ≈ +0.31), indicating that dispositional anxiety is likely contributing to higher perceived stress. Depressive symptom score is not in the clinical range (CES-D = 15, Z = +0.18) but also correlates positively with PSS (r ≈ +0.28). Self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (current happiness Z = -0.53) which aligns with the other indicators that favor higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral/academic stressors: The participant’s GPA shows a drop in the most recent term (e.g., 2016 Fall GPA = 2.17 vs prior ~3.0), which may represent an external stressor. Lower trust (Z = -0.46) and limited engagement in reading or other solitary restorative activities (reading “do not do,” Z = -0.67) provide less behavioral buffering against stress.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Physiological fitness indicators: Resting heart rate is low (54.2 bpm, Z = -0.47), and average heart-rate MESOR is below the population mean (MESOR = 65.7, Z = -1.13). Lower resting HR and reduced overall cardiac mesor can reflect higher cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline sympathetic tone, which may attenuate perceived physiological arousal and buffer stress responses. Resting HR in this dataset has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ +0.14), but the relatively low value here points away from high physiological arousal.
- Low substance use and some healthy self-ratings: Alcohol and recreational drug use are minimal (alcohol use 1–2 times/month; no recreational/non-prescribed drug use; Z-scores small to negative), which reduces contribution to perceived stress via substance-related problems. Health satisfaction is moderately positive (score 4.67, Z = +0.30), suggesting the participant perceives their physical health reasonably well, a modest protective factor.
- Social and activity engagement: The participant reports some socializing (1–2 hours, Z ≈ 0.16) and exercises at least occasionally (exercised alone 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.32). These behaviors can provide partial resilience against stress, though frequency is modest.

Physiological daily pattern and aggregated heart-rate signal
- The cosinor-derived rhythm is relatively blunted (amplitude = 6.5, Z = -1.38) with a later acrophase (peak around 6:32 PM) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.15, Z = -1.45), consistent with a flattened and less stable circadian heart-rate rhythm. Aggregated hourly deviations show expected nocturnal minima (large negative deviations overnight and early morning) and afternoon/evening elevations, but the key signal is the combination of low amplitude and low interdaily stability. Blunted amplitude and instability of rhythmicity tend to accompany irregular sleep/wake timing and have been associated with higher perceived stress and poorer subjective sleep in other samples.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study mean
- Balancing the evidence, the most salient drivers of higher perceived stress in this participant are disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI +1.05 SD), very late and variable sleep timing (median start ~03:36 AM; start-time SD Z ≈ +1.04), high nap frequency (Z ≈ +3.05), reduced interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.98), elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.95), and elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z ≈ +0.17). Physiological signs of lower baseline cardiac arousal (low resting HR and MESOR) and low substance use dampen the overall stress signal but do not fully offset the sleep- and circadian-related indicators. Given the weight of sleep/circadian dysregulation and anxiety-prone trait scores, the integrated interpretation is that the participant’s perceived stress is most consistent with being above the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.6). The pattern suggests an intermediate-to-elevated perceived stress level rather than an extreme outlier, with sleep timing regularity and circadian stability as prominent targets for intervention or further monitoring."
37218,"Summary and overall comparison
Taking the complete set of self-report and wearable-derived metrics together, the pattern is most consistent with a level of perceived stress above the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.63). Several moderately strong self-report indicators that typically co-occur with higher PSS (notably elevated depressive and trait-anxiety scores and marked subjective sleep disturbance) are present, and multiple objective markers (irregular sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude, modest intradaily fragmentation and late-night heart‑rate elevation) align with an elevated stress profile. Conversely, there are several behavioral and physiological factors that argue against very high perceived stress (e.g., absence of substance use, above-average academic performance, some circadian stability), so the final inference is that this participant’s PSS is likely above the population mean but not extreme.

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher perceived stress
Self-report measures associated with greater perceived stress are salient. The participant’s CES-D score is 24 (Z = +1.11, classified as “Depressed”), and trait anxiety (STAI trait = 49, Z = +0.76) is elevated; both of these scales have non-trivial positive correlations with PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.29, STAI r ≈ 0.32), supporting an inference of higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10, Z = +1.52, “Disturbed Sleep”), and the wearable record shows a median sleep duration of 6 h 1 min (Z = -1.45) with a very late median sleep start time near 03:56 AM and about 74 minutes of night-to-night start-time variability. Late, shortened, and subjectively disturbed sleep is commonly linked with greater perceived stress and with poorer daytime functioning. Objective circadian features also support stress-related strain: circadian amplitude is below the sample mean (amplitude = 8.83, Z = -0.63) and intradaily variability is slightly above average (0.55, Z ≈ 0.03) — a combination that often reflects blunted day–night differentiation and greater within-day fragmentation, both of which have been associated with higher stress. Physiologically, the participant’s mesor and resting heart rate are modestly above average (mesor ≈ 76.1, RHR = 61, Z ≈ +0.3), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate profile shows elevated heart rate around late-night hours (e.g., 12–2 AM elevated relative to mesor), suggesting periods of nocturnal arousal that could contribute to perceived stress and poor sleep. Behavioral inactivity (reporting no regular exercise; large negative Z-scores for exercise frequency) is another factor that tends to co-occur with higher stress in the literature.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress
There are several protective or neutral features in the dataset. The participant reports no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use (Z-scores strongly negative), which removes a common behavioral risk factor for elevated perceived stress. Academic performance is strong (2015 Fall GPA = 3.76), which may reflect functioning and coping resources in the academic domain. Social/leisure engagement is not absent — reported socializing (3–4 hours) and substantial time listening to music (>4 hours) are above-average leisure activities and may buffer stress for this individual. Objective circadian stability measures are mixed but not uniformly poor: interdaily stability is above average (0.48, Z ≈ +0.58) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is modestly above mean (0.36, Z ≈ +0.31), indicating some consistency in daily structure across days, which generally relates to lower stress. The participant reports zero naps and moderate daytime routine markers, which can be interpreted as maintenance of daily activity structure.

Integrated interpretation and uncertainty
Taken together, the strongest, convergent signals favoring elevated perceived stress are the elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, the high PSQI score and objectively late and short sleep, and circadian features indicating blunted amplitude and some within-day fragmentation; these data sources are directly and plausibly linked to higher PSS in the study correlations. Protective signals (no substance use, good GPA, some social/leisure time, and above-average interdaily stability) mitigate but do not outweigh the weight of the risk-related indicators. The magnitudes of the risk-related z-scores (CES-D Z ≈ +1.11; PSQI Z ≈ +1.52; STAI Z ≈ +0.76) suggest the participant is meaningfully higher than average on constructs that correlate with perceived stress, so the most defensible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is above the population mean (i.e., >21.63) — likely modestly elevated rather than extreme.

Caveats
This is a probabilistic, multimodal inference rather than a diagnostic statement. Correlational strengths shown in the dataset indicate associations (not causal pathways), and the PSS was not directly provided; the conclusion uses converging evidence and population-context z-scores. If monitoring or intervention is relevant to the study goals, the sleep timing/quality, daytime activity (exercise), and affective symptom measures are the domains that most consistently align with the elevated-stress pattern and could be prioritized for longitudinal assessment."
17932,"Summary inference
Across the available multimodal data, the profile presents a mixture of markers. Trait symptom measures (STAI, CES-D) and several objective physiological and circadian metrics point toward relatively low chronic physiological arousal and stable daily structure, whereas a very elevated self‑reported sleep disturbance score and a late habitual sleep onset suggest a prominent subjective sleep problem that could elevate perceived stress. Balancing these sources, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress appears near or slightly below the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), rather than substantially above it.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
The strongest single signal in the dataset that would be expected to increase perceived stress is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score of 13 (Z = 2.9), indicating substantial subjective sleep disturbance over the previous month. That subjective sleep impairment, together with a habitual sleep‑start time near 01:24 AM, may reflect evening hyperarousal, poor sleep hygiene, or stress‑related sleep complaints and is typically associated with higher perceived stress in prior work. Self‑rated current happiness is slightly lower than the sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53), and social‑trust is below average (Z ≈ -1.1), both of which can be permissive contextual factors for elevated perceived stress. There are also some hours with relatively elevated evening heart‑rate deviations (e.g., late evening hours show positive deviations from the mesor) that could reflect evening activity or arousal that aligns with the late sleep timing.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
Multiple measures point in the opposite direction — toward lower perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) and depressive symptom burden (CES‑D = 12, Z = -0.14) are below or near the sample mean and not in ranges suggesting elevated chronic negative affect; self‑esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 0.82). Objective cardiovascular indices show a low resting heart rate (48.7 bpm, Z = -1.13) and a low mesor (66.6, Z ≈ -1.0), which are consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower tonic physiological arousal. Circadian rhythm metrics indicate robust, regular rhythms (interdaily stability 0.54, Z = 1.08; autocorrelation at 24h Z = 1.65) and low rhythm fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = -1.24). The participant reports regular moderate exercise (individual exercise three times a week or more, Z = 1.07) and shows long median objective sleep duration (8 h 35 min, Z = 1.74), which are both protective against higher perceived stress. Academic performance (GPAs ~3.8) and relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 0.97) further support functioning consistent with lower perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and relative weighting
When weighing signals, objective physiological and behavioral markers (low resting HR, strong interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, regular exercise, long objective sleep duration) and low scores on trait anxiety and depressive symptoms provide convergent evidence that chronic physiological and psychological stress load is not strongly elevated. The primary contradictory signal is the marked subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI) and late sleep timing; because subjective sleep complaints often co‑occur with elevated perceived stress and may strongly influence day‑to‑day stress perception, this feature meaningfully moderates the otherwise low‑stress pattern. Overall, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress level is likely close to the study sample mean, with a modest tendency toward being below the mean rather than clearly above it.

Notes and recommended next steps for interpretation
- The PSQI is an outsized signal relative to other self‑report scores and should be followed up as an important contributor to current stress perception; objective long sleep duration coupled with high PSQI suggests a discrepancy between quantity and perceived quality of sleep.  
- The objective circadian and cardiovascular indicators argue against high chronic physiological stress, making an interpretation of transient or sleep‑specific complaints (rather than pervasive high perceived stress) plausible.  
- Given the heterogeneity of signals, direct measurement of the participant’s PSS score (if not already available) and targeted assessment of sleep quality and sleep timing would clarify whether the elevated PSQI reflects sleep pathology, situational factors, or perceptual factors that inflate perceived stress.

In sum: considering the mix of strong objective markers of low chronic arousal and functioning alongside a notably elevated subjective sleep disturbance, the most defensible categorical placement is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the population mean and likely slightly below it overall, but with a pronounced subjective sleep complaint that increases risk for episodic elevations in perceived stress."
81420,"Summary and overall comparison:
Taken together, the multimodal data indicate that this participant’s profile of symptoms, behaviors, and physiology is more consistent with perceived stress above the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). Elevated scores on depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 25, Z = 1.22) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86), along with poor subjective sleep quality (PSQI = 8, Z = 0.59) and low self‑esteem (RSES Z = -1.01), point toward greater perceived stress than the average study participant. Wearable-derived features (reduced circadian amplitude, somewhat elevated MESOR and resting heart rate, and irregular timing of sleep onset) provide additional physiological signals that align with a greater stress burden overall.

Factors indicating relatively higher perceived stress:
Several convergent signals favor an interpretation of elevated stress. Self-report measures that typically co-occur with higher perceived stress are elevated here: depressive symptoms (CES-D) and trait anxiety (STAI) are substantially above the sample mean and both show positive correlations with PSS in the study. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) indicates poorer sleep quality despite an objectively average total duration; poor sleep quality commonly accompanies and amplifies perceived stress. Low self‑rated health satisfaction and reduced self‑esteem further align with higher perceived stress (both show correlations in the expected direction). On the physiological side, resting heart rate is modestly above the sample mean (RHR Z = 0.53; correlation with PSS positive), the cosinor amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is reduced (Amplitude Z = -0.74; lower amplitude associated with higher PSS in the sample), and MESOR is slightly elevated (Z = 0.6). Together these circadian/HR features (higher baseline tone with flattened day–night variation) are commonly observed in states of sustained autonomic arousal or dysregulated recovery and therefore are consistent with greater perceived stress. Finally, the participant’s sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:40), and interdaily stability of the heart‑rate rhythm is low (IS Z = -0.99), indicating irregular behavioral timing—an additional behavioral pattern that, in many studies, relates to elevated stress or poorer stress regulation.

Factors indicating relatively lower perceived stress or resilience:
There are several features that temper the overall stress signal and suggest behavioral resilience. Objective total sleep duration is near the study median (median ≈ 7 h 12 m, Z ≈ 0.02) and daytime napping is minimal, which supports preserved opportunity for restorative sleep. Intradaily variability (a metric of short‑term fragmentation of the rhythm) is unusually low (IV Z = -1.66); because higher IV is associated with greater stress in this sample, the participant’s low IV points away from fragmented, stress‑related activity patterns. The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three times per week or more, Z = 1.07) and maintains social contact (1–2 hours socializing), both behavioral resources that typically buffer perceived stress. Recreational drug use is absent and alcohol use is moderate; these behavioral patterns are not strongly associated with higher PSS in the sample. Subjective current happiness is slightly above the mean (Z = 0.55), which also moderates the overall stress signal.

Physiological and circadian interpretation:
Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations and cosinor-derived circadian metrics suggest a somewhat flattened but coherent daily cardiovascular pattern with a peak (acrophase) in the early evening (≈ 5:52 PM). The reduced amplitude indicates smaller day–night differences in heart rate, which can reflect attenuated physiological recovery overnight or blunted activity–rest contrasts. MESOR is slightly elevated, and resting heart rate is modestly higher than average—together implying a higher baseline cardiovascular tone. Interdaily stability is low, suggesting variability in the timing of daily routines (e.g., late and variable sleep onsets — median start ~02:40 with SD ≈ 93 minutes). At the same time, intradaily variability is low, indicating relatively few abrupt shifts in activity across the day; this could reflect a consistently late-waking/daytime behavioral pattern rather than fragmented activity. The pattern of objective sleep duration being adequate but subjective sleep quality being poor further supports a mismatch between quantity and restorative quality of sleep.

Holistic conclusion:
Balancing these lines of evidence, the profile points to perceived stress that is likely above the study sample mean. Elevations in depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety, reduced self‑esteem and health satisfaction, subjective sleep disturbance, somewhat elevated baseline cardiac tone and reduced circadian amplitude, and irregular sleep timing are the most salient contributors to that conclusion. Protective influences—regular exercise, social time, normal total sleep duration, and low short‑term rhythm fragmentation—mitigate but do not fully offset the signals associated with higher stress. In summary: the participant’s multimodal data indicate an overall perceived stress level above the population mean, with both psychological symptom burden and physiological markers driving that inference while behavioral resources offer partial buffering."
67709,"Summary: The multimodal record presents a mixed profile. Self-report measures show elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 29, Z = 1.63) and mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46), lower-than-average self-esteem (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73), and a PSQI score just above the conventional sleep-disturbance cutoff (PSQI = 6). Wearable-derived physiology indicates a relatively low average cardiac output (MESOR = 67.9, Z = -0.83; resting heart rate = 53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56), a pronounced late-afternoon/evening heart rate elevation (largest aggregate deviation at 5–6 pm = +29.45, Z = 2.76), and circadian features suggesting reduced 24-hour regularity (autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.19, Z = -1.12). Sleep timing is markedly delayed (median sleep start ≈ 03:45 AM) with long median duration (8 h 16 m, Z = 1.34) but high night-to-night variability (SD = 173 min, Z = 1.65). Taken together, these elements point to behavioral and affective patterns that bear relevance to perceived stress.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several self-report indicators that correlate positively with PSS are elevated. The CES-D score (29, Z = 1.63) and the STAI trait score (46, Z = 0.46) are both positively associated with higher PSS in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), suggesting affective strain and anxiety proneness that typically co-occur with greater perceived stress. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 6) and large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD 173 min, Z = 1.65; sleep-variability r ≈ 0.13) are also consistent with higher stress. Circadian irregularity markers that are low relative to the sample — notably a low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.19, Z = -1.12) and modest interdaily stability (0.38, Z = -0.24) — indicate weaker day-to-day rhythm regularity, a pattern that is often linked to elevated perceived stress. The extremely late median sleep onset (~03:45 AM) and pronounced late-day heart-rate surge (5–6 pm deviation +29.45, Z = 2.76) may reflect shifted/irregular daily routines and episodes of late-afternoon physiological arousal, both of which can accompany higher stress or dysregulated coping.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: There are several protective or stress-buffering signals. The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use; Z-scores strongly negative), which reduces exposure to substance-related stressors and is associated with lower PSS correlations in this sample. Objective cardiovascular markers reflect comparatively good cardiac fitness or lower baseline sympathetic tone (resting HR 53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56; MESOR lower than mean), which—independent of momentary arousal spikes—can be associated with better physiological resilience. Reported social exercise frequency is relatively high (exercised with others three+ times/week, Z = 1.23), and current happiness and health satisfaction are modestly above average (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.22), both of which can protect against perceived stress. In addition, intradaily variability (0.46, Z = -0.60) is lower than average, which can indicate fewer rapid transitions between rest and activity within days and may reflect periods of consolidated behavior that are less stress-promoting.

Integration and limitations: The most salient signals pushing toward a higher inferred perceived stress are the elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety-proneness, disturbed and highly variable sleep timing (especially very late sleep onset), and circadian irregularity (low 24-h autocorrelation). Protective signals—low substance use, relatively low resting heart rate, frequent group exercise, and modestly higher happiness/health satisfaction—temper that impression but do not outweigh the affective symptom burden and sleep/circadian irregularity. Correlations between many wearable features and PSS in the sample are small-to-moderate, so physiological patterns should be interpreted cautiously and in combination with self-report. Also note that hourly heart-rate deviations are aggregated across days and do not represent discrete events; causal direction between mood, behavior, and physiology cannot be determined from these cross-sectional/aggregated measures.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSS: Considering the balance of evidence—particularly the elevated CES-D and STAI scores, disturbed/irregular sleep timing, and circadian markers associated with higher stress—the participant’s overall profile is most consistent with an inferred perceived stress level above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.6). This inference reflects convergent affective and behavioral signals even while acknowledging several physiological and lifestyle factors that could mitigate stress."
36552,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of risk and protective features for perceived stress. Trait anxiety and self-reported sleep disturbance, together with several wearable-derived markers of circadian disruption and elevated resting cardiovascular tone, point toward relatively greater perceived stress. At the same time, intact mood/depression scores, high self-esteem, regular individual exercise, low substance use, and strong academic performance serve as protective factors that would be expected to mitigate perceived stress. Considering the total pattern and the magnitudes of the relevant measures, the participant’s inferred overall perceived stress level is above the study population mean PSS score (population mean = 21.61).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, z ≈ +0.27), a measure that correlates positively with PSS in this sample (score correlation ≈ 0.31), suggesting a vulnerability to higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is in the disturbed range (PSQI = 7), which commonly co-occurs with higher stress. Wearable physiology shows features associated with stress-related dysregulation: a higher-than-average resting heart rate (64.3 bpm, z ≈ +0.73) and a blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -1.07, amplitude correlation with PSS ≈ -0.16) — a lower amplitude in heart-rate rhythms has been linked to poorer circadian organization and greater strain. Measures of rhythm regularity indicate instability and fragmentation: low interdaily stability (0.29, z ≈ -0.99) and elevated intradaily variability (0.72, z ≈ +1.23); these wearable-derived metrics are conceptually and empirically associated with greater stress and worse sleep. Behaviorally, median sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 23 min, z ≈ -1.0) and sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:28 AM), both of which are consistent with higher perceived stress or with schedules that can exacerbate stress-related physiology. Finally, there is a pronounced aggregate heart-rate elevation in mid-afternoon (3–4 PM deviation ≈ +19.9, z ≈ +1.99), which could reflect a daily period of higher physiological arousal (workload, deadlines, or emotional reactivity) that contributes to perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several self-report and behavioral indicators are protective. Depressive symptoms are low-to-moderate (CES-D = 10, z ≈ -0.34; classified “not depressed”), and the participant reports high self-esteem (Rosenberg = 40, z ≈ +0.26), both features that typically relate to lower perceived stress (CES-D correlates positively and RSES negatively with PSS here, though correlations are small). The participant reports relatively high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction = 5/7, z ≈ +0.55) and maintains frequent solo exercise (three times/week or more, z ≈ +1.07), behaviors that are stress-buffering. Substance use and non-prescribed drug use are minimal, which reduces behavioral stress risk. Academically, GPAs are high across semesters, indicating competence in a core domain and potentially lower academic stress or better coping. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep start time is not large (sleep SD ≈ 49 minutes, z ≈ -1.17 and sleep start SD z ≈ -0.75), suggesting relatively consistent sleep timing even if the duration is short; this consistency can be protective relative to highly irregular sleep schedules.

Integrated interpretation of physiological and behavioral rhythms: The wearable circadian profile points to a consolidated pattern of short, late sleep together with a relatively blunted heart-rate amplitude and elevated intraday fragmentation. Low interdaily stability indicates day-to-day rhythm irregularity, whereas the low standard deviation in sleep duration suggests the participant keeps a fairly consistent, but late and short, sleep schedule. The elevated resting HR and afternoon HR spike suggest mild autonomic activation during waking hours; both of these features have small positive correlations with PSS in the sample and jointly support an interpretation of greater perceived physiological arousal. Conversely, the participant’s regular exercise and low substance use likely buffer some of this physiological burden. Taken together, the physiological profile is most consistent with chronic low-to-moderate strain rather than acute severe dysregulation.

Limitations and overall conclusion: Many individual correlations with PSS in the dataset are small, so no single variable deterministically sets perceived stress. Nonetheless, the convergence of elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, shortened/late sleep timing, blunted circadian amplitude, elevated intradaily variability, and higher resting heart rate provides a coherent signal pointing toward greater perceived stress. Protective factors (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem, regular exercise, low substance use, high academic performance) mitigate but do not fully counterbalance the stress-related signals. On balance, the participant’s profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level above the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61). This interpretation should be understood as probabilistic and context-dependent; longitudinal data or a direct PSS score would refine the estimate."
63138,"Summary: Across self-report and wearable-derived data, the participant shows a mixed profile in relation to perceived stress. Several subjective indices (low depressive symptoms, above-average happiness, high health satisfaction, strong academic performance) and a objectively long and regular sleep duration point toward lower perceived stress. In contrast, certain wearable-derived physiological markers — notably relatively high intradaily variability of heart rate and a modestly elevated resting heart rate/mesor — indicate greater physiological instability or arousal that has been associated with higher perceived stress in the study sample. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress is likely near to slightly below the study sample mean rather than markedly above it.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: The participant’s circadian heart-rate rhythm shows elevated intradaily variability (value 0.71, Z = 1.16), a relatively large deviation from the study mean; within this dataset intradaily variability has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.16), indicating that greater fragmentation or frequent shifts in activity/physiological state across the day tends to accompany higher perceived stress. Resting heart rate and mesor are modestly above average (RHR 62.9 bpm, Z = 0.56; mesor 77.14, Z = 0.44), and each has a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14 and 0.06 respectively), which is consistent with a mild elevation in baseline arousal. The participant’s habitual sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:37), which can reflect eveningness or schedule stressors; while timing itself is not strongly correlated here with PSS, late timing combined with physiological fragmentation can reflect circadian misalignment that is linked to stress-related dysregulation.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Subjective mental-health and wellbeing measures favor lower stress. Depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 8, Z ≈ −0.55) and trait anxiety is at or slightly below the study mean (STAI = 40, Z ≈ −0.13), both of which are associated with lower PSS in the sample than higher scores would be. Self-reported happiness (Z ≈ +0.55) and health satisfaction (Z ≈ +0.38) are above average, and self-esteem is near the sample mean; these psychosocial resources typically buffer perceived stress (self-esteem correlation with PSS is small and negative). Behaviorally, the participant reports long and consistent nocturnal sleep (median duration 8 h 21 min, Z = +1.45; sleep duration SD and sleep-start SD are both below average), which in this sample is weakly associated with lower PSS. Academic indicators (high GPAs) and low reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs are additional contextual signs consistent with lower perceived stress.

Integration of circadian/physiological patterns with behavior: The cosinor-derived amplitude is relatively high (amplitude Z ≈ +0.88) and, in this dataset, higher amplitude is modestly associated with lower PSS (r ≈ −0.17), which supports the idea of a structured day/night contrast that may be protective. However, this coexists with high intradaily variability and a slightly elevated baseline heart rate: together these suggest that while the participant’s overall day-night amplitude is pronounced, their day-to-day or within-day stability is somewhat fragmented. The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show expected low overnight values and afternoon/evening increases (peak around 6–7 PM), a typical diurnal profile; several daytime elevations have small negative correlations with PSS in the sample, implying that higher daytime activity/arousal in this participant does not necessarily track with greater perceived stress in the group-level pattern.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study sample: Considering the relative magnitudes and directions of psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological indicators, the preponderance of evidence favors a perceived stress level that is at or slightly below the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68). Key protective signals are the low CES-D score, above-average happiness and health satisfaction, consistent and relatively long sleep (Z +1.45), and high amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm. Countervailing physiological signals (notably intradaily variability Z +1.16 and modestly elevated resting heart rate Z +0.56) suggest some physiological arousal or rhythm fragmentation that could push perceived stress upward in particular contexts. Overall, the participant’s profile is most consistent with perceived stress “near the mean” or “slightly below the mean” of this sample, rather than substantially above it.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation: Correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the study are generally small-to-moderate, so any inference about PSS from a single participant’s multimodal data carries uncertainty. The data pattern suggests modest but not definitive physiological signs of strain superimposed on generally favorable psychosocial and sleep indicators; clinical or diagnostic conclusions are not supported by these data alone. If desired, further resolution could be gained by examining contemporaneous daily PSS ratings, context around late bedtimes (e.g., coursework deadlines), or additional behavioral markers (e.g., objective activity/sedentary time) to clarify whether the elevated intradaily variability reflects situational demands or measurement noise."
16654,"Summary conclusion
Taken together, the multimodal evidence from self-report and wearable data points toward an overall perceived stress level that is likely below the study sample mean (population PSS mean = 21.62). Multiple convergent indicators — especially very low self-reported depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, a robust and regular heart‑rate circadian profile, consistent and sufficient sleep duration, and active social and exercise behaviors — favor a relatively lower PSS. A small set of features (notably a slightly elevated PSQI score indicating subjective sleep disturbance and a late median sleep start time) suggest some stress‑relevant burden or lifestyle factors that could raise perceived stress for this individual, but these are outweighed by the preponderance of lower‑stress signals in the available data. This inference should be treated as probabilistic: the correlations between individual features and PSS are generally modest and the wearable heart‑rate measures are aggregate summaries rather than momentary stress markers.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress
- Psychological trait and symptom measures strongly favor lower stress: CES‑D = 0 (Z = -1.38) and STAI‑Trait = 34 (Z = -0.72) indicate negligible depressive symptoms and below‑average trait anxiety relative to the sample. High self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 39, Z ≈ 0.11) and above‑average health satisfaction (6/7, Z = 1.30) further support psychological resilience and lower perceived burden. These self‑report indices are among the strongest single‑source indicators in the dataset and have directionally expected associations with lower PSS.
- Behavioral and social resources also point to lower stress: frequent socializing (2–3 hours/day, Z ≈ 0.95) and regular exercise with others (three+ times/week, Z ≈ 1.23) are protective factors that commonly associate with lower perceived stress and better mood. Recreational drug use is absent and alcohol use is modest (1–2 times/week), reducing concerns about high‑risk coping patterns.
- Objective sleep and circadian physiology are consistent with relatively good regulation: median nightly sleep duration is healthy (7 h 46 min, Z = 0.73) and nightly sleep timing is unusually stable (sleep start SD = 30 minutes, Z = -1.17; sleep duration SD = 55 minutes, Z = -1.04). Wearable circadian metrics show above‑average interdaily stability (0.54, Z = 1.08) and a relatively large amplitude (15.22, Z = 1.44), indicating a strong, regular day–night heart‑rate rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart‑rate profile shows a pronounced nocturnal dip and a robust daytime peak (especially 1–2 pm, Z = 1.83), a pattern that—on average in this sample—associates with lower PSS (amplitude correlation with PSS ≈ -0.16; interdaily stability correlation ≈ -0.12). These circadian features suggest consistent sleep–wake behavior and low physiological arousal overnight, both of which typically relate to lower perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress (or reasons for caution)
- Subjective sleep quality: the PSQI score is 6 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”), which crosses the common clinical cutoff and indicates that the participant experiences some sleep problems despite an objectively sufficient duration. Subjective poor sleep commonly elevates perceived stress and can diverge from wearable sleep duration metrics.
- Late sleep timing: the median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:37 AM). Late bedtimes can reflect evening obligations, social schedules, or circadian preference, and for some individuals are associated with higher stress or poorer daytime functioning even when total sleep time is adequate.
- Small physiological/behavioral risk signals: intradaily variability (0.58, Z = 0.24) is slightly elevated and correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16), and resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with PSS (resting HR = 59.7, Z = 0.18; corr ≈ 0.14). Alcohol use is modestly above average (Z ≈ 1.0) and could be an occasional coping behavior; current self‑reported happiness is somewhat below sample mean (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53). These signals are small in magnitude and individually explain only a modest portion of variance in PSS in the cohort.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the population mean
Balancing the evidence, the stronger and more consistent signals (very low depression and trait anxiety scores, high social and exercise engagement, robust and regular heart‑rate circadian amplitude, adequate and stable sleep duration) outweigh the limited indicators of stress (PSQI = 6, late bedtime, small elevations in intradaily variability and alcohol use). Therefore the most defensible inference from this multimodal dataset is that the participant’s perceived stress level is likely below the study sample mean PSS of 21.62 (i.e., “below the population mean”), rather than near or above it. The magnitude of the difference is not extreme based on available z‑scores and small effect correlations—this suggests a modestly lower perceived stress relative to peers rather than an outlier low value.

Limitations and caveats
This conclusion is probabilistic and constrained by several limitations: (1) correlations between individual features and PSS in the cohort are generally small, so any single indicator has limited predictive power; (2) wearable heart‑rate metrics are aggregated across days and cannot capture acute stress episodes; (3) subjective and objective sleep measures diverge (adequate objective duration but PSQI > 5), which merits attention because subjective sleep disturbance can contribute to perceived stress even when objective markers look favorable. If a clinical or programmatic decision depends on an accurate PSS score, direct measurement of the participant’s current PSS and further longitudinal monitoring would be advisable."
29134,"Summary — inferred perceived stress and overall balance:
The profile presents a mixture of clear risk signals for elevated perceived stress and several countervailing protective features. On balance, the strongest single signals pointing toward higher perceived stress are subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11; z ≈ 1.98) and very irregular sleep timing (sleep start time SD ≈ 183 minutes; z ≈ 2.20). Against that, relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 38; z ≈ -0.33), modest depressive symptom scores (CES-D = 12; z ≈ -0.14), above-average engagement in group exercise and sports (z ≈ 1.23 and 1.58), and favorable self-evaluations (self-esteem and happiness z-scores positive) are notable protective factors. Considering the relative magnitudes of these effects (large z-scores for sleep disturbance/irregularity versus moderate z-scores in protective domains), the participant’s inferred perceived stress most likely falls near the study sample mean, with a modest tilt toward higher stress driven primarily by sleep problems. Stated relative to the sample mean PSS (21.62), the participant’s profile is best characterized as near the population mean, possibly slightly above it when sleep-related indicators are weighted.

Factors consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Sleep-related evidence is the clearest stress-related signal. The PSQI score of 11 (z ≈ 1.98) indicates subjectively disturbed sleep quality, and sleep start time variability is substantially elevated (SD ≈ 183 minutes; z ≈ 2.20). Higher sleep variability and poor subjective sleep quality in this dataset are positively associated with higher PSS in the sample and are commonly linked to heightened perceived stress. In addition, sleep duration variability is elevated (SD ≈ 159 minutes; z ≈ 1.33), which can destabilize daytime functioning and relate to higher stress.  
- Some circadian/physiological features provide weaker support for stress elevation: lower heart-rate amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -0.51) has been associated in the sample with higher PSS, and several early-morning hourly heart-rate deviations show positive correlations with PSS (small effect sizes), which could reflect fragments of physiological arousal during typical sleep hours. These features are secondary compared with the strong subjective sleep signal but are concordant with increased stress vulnerability.

Factors consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Trait affective measures and mood-related scores are generally protective. Trait anxiety and depressive symptoms are both below the study average (STAI z ≈ -0.33; CES-D z ≈ -0.14), and self-esteem is slightly above average (RSES z ≈ 0.11). Self-reported current happiness and health satisfaction are also above average (happiness z ≈ 0.55; health satisfaction z ≈ 0.55). These patterns point away from chronically high perceived stress and suggest psychological resources that buffer stress perception.  
- Objective autonomic markers are likewise not alarming: resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm; z ≈ -0.33), a pattern that—given the small positive correlation between resting heart rate and PSS in this sample—leans toward lower perceived stress. Measures of daily rhythm regularity are mixed but not strongly dysregulated: interdaily stability is near average (z ≈ 0.0) and 24-hour autocorrelation is mildly above average (z ≈ 0.39), features that tend to associate with better circadian structure and lower PSS.  
- Behavioral supports are present: frequent group exercise and sports engagement (z ≈ 1.23 and 1.58) are sizable positive lifestyle features that correlate with lower PSS in the sample, and the participant reports low recreational drug use and only moderate alcohol use. Social trust and some leisure behaviors (reading) are above average and correlate with lower stress.

Circadian and heart-rate pattern interpretation:
- Cosinor-derived rhythm parameters indicate a modestly blunted amplitude (amplitude z ≈ -0.51) and a MESOR slightly below the sample mean (MESOR z ≈ -0.56). The acrophase (peak) around ~5:06 PM places peak heart-rate activity in a typical late-afternoon/early-evening window. Lower amplitude can reflect weaker daily variation in autonomic drive, which in this dataset relates modestly to higher PSS; however, the participant’s interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are not degraded and in some metrics are slightly favorable. Taken together, these features suggest that while overall daily rhythm strength is somewhat reduced (supporting the sleep disturbance signal), overall day-to-day rhythm regularity is adequate, which mitigates the interpretation of pervasive circadian disruption.

Behavioral and social context:
- The participant engages in frequent structured physical activity—notably group exercise and sports—which is a robust protective behavior in this sample. Self-reported socializing time is somewhat lower than average (z ≈ -0.62), and some leisure activities (e.g., listening to music) are low, which could reduce everyday mood repair options. Academic performance (GPA) and health satisfaction do not provide strong signals toward elevated stress. Alcohol use is modest and unlikely to be a major driver.

Holistic conclusion and caveats:
- The most salient risk for elevated perceived stress is sleep disturbance and very irregular sleep timing (large z-scores). Counterbalancing factors—lower trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, low resting heart rate, frequent group physical activity, and positive self-evaluations—are substantial and point toward resilience. Considering magnitude and directional consistency, the best-supported conclusion is that this participant’s perceived stress is approximately near the study population mean PSS, with a modest upward influence from pronounced sleep problems. If scored, their PSS would be expected to fall close to 21.62 (the sample mean), perhaps slightly above it rather than markedly elevated.  
- Limitations: this inference integrates cross-sectional survey scores with aggregated wearable summaries and correlations; it is probabilistic rather than definitive. The strongest single domain for intervention to reduce perceived stress would be sleep regularity and subjective sleep quality."
24029,"Clinical-trait and symptom-report indicators point to elevated affective burden that is consistent with relatively higher perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score is 21 (Z = 0.8, classified as “Depressed” in this scoring system) and the trait anxiety (STAI) score is 50 (Z = 0.86, “anxious”), both of which are established correlates of higher PSS in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is marginally disturbed (PSQI = 6), which also tends to co-occur with greater perceived stress. Low self‑esteem (RSES = 29; Z = −1.29) is another trait-level feature that, given its negative correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ −0.15), would be expected to contribute to higher perceived stress. Taken together, these self-report measures form a consistent set of risk signals for elevated perceived stress relative to the study population.

Several wearable-derived circadian and activity metrics reinforce the pattern toward higher stress. Intradaily variability is relatively high (0.70; Z = 1.09), reflecting more fragmented hour-to-hour structure in heart-rate activity, and this metric has a positive sample correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.15). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is modest (0.26; Z = −0.53), suggesting weaker day-to-day regularity of the heart-rate rhythm; in this sample higher 24‑hour autocorrelation is associated with lower PSS, so the participant’s lower value is consistent with higher perceived stress. Sleep timing variability is non-trivial (sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes) and median nightly sleep is slightly short (6 h 46 min; Z = −0.52), which together can contribute to higher perceived stress or reduce resilience to stressors.

Conversely, multiple behavioral and physiological features in the dataset suggest protective influences that would favor lower perceived stress. The participant reports frequent exercise and sports activity (three times a week or more; Z-scores 1.07–1.58), a behavior that is generally associated with reduced stress and improved mood (sample correlations here are small but positive for activity and often protective). Substance use is absent (no beer, wine/liquor, or recreational/non-prescribed drug use), removing a common risk pathway to higher perceived stress. Objective resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm; Z = −0.42), which is often an index of higher cardiovascular fitness and baseline physiological resilience. Self‑reported current happiness is above the sample mean (rating = 4.0; Z ≈ 0.55), a correlate that is associated with lower PSS (r ≈ −0.2).

Integrating the multimodal evidence yields a balanced but weighted picture. Trait affective symptoms (notably elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms), disturbed subjective sleep quality, and circadian fragmentation (high intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation) consistently point toward above-average perceived stress. Offset against these risk signals are robust protective behaviors and physiological signs—regular, frequent exercise, low substance use, and a relatively low resting heart rate—along with modestly elevated self-reported happiness, which would be expected to mitigate stress. Overall, the preponderance of clinically relevant symptom scores and circadian instability suggests the participant’s perceived stress is likely above the study population mean (population PSS mean = 21.59). The pattern is most consistent with a moderate elevation in perceived stress rather than an extreme outlier.

Caveats and limits: these inferences are probabilistic and rely on cross-sectional correlations and summary-level wearable aggregates rather than a direct PSS score for the individual. Circadian and heart-rate aggregates are temporally pooled and reflect typical daily patterns rather than responses to specific stressors. The combination of strong protective health behaviors and simultaneously elevated affective symptom measures suggests that targeted interventions addressing mood and sleep/circadian regularity (while reinforcing existing exercise habits) would be congruent with the observed profile."
35361,"Summary inference
Based on the combination of self-report and wearable-derived measures, the preponderance of evidence points toward this participant having a lower-than-average level of perceived stress relative to the study sample. Multiple behavioral, affective, and circadian markers align with lower stress (e.g., low depressive and trait-anxiety scores, high self‑esteem, good subjective sleep quality, regular circadian structure, low resting heart rate). While a few physiological features (notably large nighttime heart‑rate troughs that show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample) warrant caution, they do not outweigh the consistent pattern of indicators associated with lower perceived stress. Relative to the study population mean PSS of 21.62 (SD 3.68), the overall profile is most consistent with a PSS score below the population mean.

Factors consistent with relatively low perceived stress
- Self-report mental health and wellbeing: Depressive symptoms are low (CES‑D = 7; Z = -0.66, classified “Not depressed”), trait anxiety is below average (STAI = 38; Z = -0.33), and self‑esteem is at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40; Z = 0.26). These self‑report indices are commonly inversely related to perceived stress and here together suggest lower psychological burden. Current happiness and health satisfaction are also above the sample mean (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.55), further supporting lower perceived stress.
- Sleep quality and consistency: Subjective sleep quality is good (PSQI = 4; Z = -1.26, “Good Sleep”). Median nightly sleep duration is near seven hours (6 h 56 m; Z = -0.31) with relatively low night‑to‑night variability (SD 61 min; Z = -0.91). Mean daily naps are effectively absent (Z = -0.86). Together these suggest adequate and reasonably regular sleep, which typically associates with reduced perceived stress.
- Circadian robustness and daytime physiological activation: Heart‑rate circadian metrics indicate structured, regular rhythms—high interdaily stability (0.59; Z = 1.49), low intradaily variability (0.37; Z = -1.24), and positive 24‑hour autocorrelation (0.41; Z = 0.73). Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is above average (13.48; Z = 0.87) and acrophase is in the late afternoon (≈4:28 PM). These markers of robust daily structure and high amplitude are generally linked with better regulation and lower perceived stress (amplitude and stability correlations with PSS in the sample trend negative).
- Cardiovascular baseline consistent with good fitness/recovery: Resting heart rate is low (49.8 bpm; Z = -0.99). Lower resting heart rate in this context likely reflects cardiovascular fitness or parasympathetic predominance, both of which often correspond with lower perceived stress or greater physiological resilience.

Factors that could denote relatively higher perceived stress or add uncertainty
- Nighttime heart‑rate troughs: The aggregate hourly deviations show pronounced negative deviations during the deep night/early morning (e.g., −24.5 to −28.4 bpm from mesor between ~3:00–5:00 AM; Zs down to −1.71). In the study sample some of those early‑morning troughs have small positive correlations with PSS (correlations ~0.14–0.21), indicating that, in this dataset, deeper nocturnal reductions in heart rate were modestly associated with higher perceived stress for some participants. For this participant the troughs are large but these correlations are small; thus this pattern raises a small cautionary signal but is not a strong indicator on its own.
- Limited social metrics and trust: The participant reports relatively low trust (Z = -1.1) and modest time socializing (socializing Z = -0.62). Social isolation or reduced perceived social support can amplify stress responses, but in this case correlations with PSS are very small and other social/leisure indicators (reading, exercise, low substance use) suggest adaptive routines rather than isolation-driven distress.
- Lack of an actual measured PSS in the provided file: Inference must rely on proxies and correlations. Several available correlations between individual metrics and PSS in the study are small in magnitude, meaning individual features should be interpreted cautiously and in aggregate.

Holistic conclusion and confidence
Taken together, self‑report, behavioral, and wearable physiology converge on a coherent profile of relatively low perceived stress: low depressive and anxiety scores, high self‑esteem and positive affect, good subjective sleep, frequent exercise, low substance use, regular and high‑amplitude circadian heart‑rate rhythms, and a low resting heart rate. A minority of physiological details (notably large nocturnal HR troughs and modestly reduced social/trust scores) introduce small areas of uncertainty but do not substantively counter the prevailing signal. Therefore, the most defensible categorical comparison is that this participant’s inferred perceived stress level is below the study population mean PSS (i.e., below 21.62). This inference is probabilistic and constrained by the absence of the participant’s actual PSS score and by generally small effect sizes in some correlations; it should be treated as an evidence‑based estimate rather than a definitive measurement."
49086,"Summary: The participant’s multi-modal profile shows a mixture of behavioral signs of late-evening activation and some subjective sleep disturbance together with robust markers of low mood and anxiety symptoms, high self-regard, social engagement, and generally healthy physiology. When these lines of evidence are weighed together, the balance favors an inference of perceived stress below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.61, SD = 3.68). This conclusion is probabilistic and based on converging trait-level and physiological indicators rather than on a directly reported PSS value.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several circadian and sleep-related indicators point to evening/night activation that can be associated with greater perceived stress. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (approximately 02:19 AM) and the PSQI score is 6 (above the common cutoff of 5), indicating subjective sleep disturbance. Wearable-derived hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced positive deviation from the mesor around midnight–1:00 AM (mean deviation ~9.8 bpm; Z ≈ 1.66), and elevated heart rate at 1–2 AM relative to many peers (Z ≈ 1.18). Circadian amplitude is lower than the study mean (amplitude 9.01, Z ≈ -0.57) and interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.39, Z ≈ -0.16); lower amplitude and somewhat reduced stability can reflect weakened daily structure and have been associated, in this dataset, with stress-related variance (amplitude correlation with PSS ≈ -0.16; intradaily variability correlation with PSS ≈ 0.16). Health satisfaction is also lower than average (score 3.33, Z ≈ -0.7) and self-reported current happiness is slightly below the mean (score 3.0, Z ≈ -0.53), both of which are modestly concordant with elevated perceived stress.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Trait and behavioral measures provide stronger signal for lower perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 1.0; Z ≈ -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31; Z ≈ -1.02) are well below the sample mean, and both scales correlate positively with PSS in this dataset (CES-D corr ≈ 0.28; STAI corr ≈ 0.31), supporting a lower inferred PSS. Self-esteem is higher than average (Rosenberg score Z ≈ 1.10), a trait negatively correlated with PSS (corr ≈ -0.15), which also points toward lower perceived stress. Physiologically, resting heart rate is relatively low (56.3 bpm; Z ≈ -0.22), and the 24-hour autocorrelation of heart rate shows above-average regularity (autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ 0.39), both consistent with stable autonomic regulation rather than chronic hyperarousal. Behavioral buffers include frequent socializing (2–3 hours; Z ≈ 0.95) and high academic performance (GPA consistently high), which are likely protective against perceived stress. Median nightly sleep duration (~7 h 18 min; Z ≈ 0.15) is adequate on average despite the late timing, and mean daily naps are minimal.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample: Putting these elements together, the strongest and most direct predictors of lower perceived stress are the very low depression and trait-anxiety scores and the relatively high self-esteem; these measures have the largest and most direct correlations with PSS in the dataset and therefore carry substantial weight in inference. Nighttime physiological activation and subjective sleep disturbance are notable countervailing factors, but their magnitudes are smaller and more circumscribed (specific to late-night hours and sleep timing rather than pervasive daily dysregulation). Consequently, the overall profile is best described as indicating perceived stress below the population mean (i.e., lower-than-average PSS), though not uniformly low on every dimension. If expressed categorically, the participant would be expected to score lower than the sample mean PSS = 21.61, rather than near or above it.

Limitations and caveats: This inference is based on correlational patterns and cross-sectional summaries rather than a directly reported PSS value; some measures (e.g., late sleep timing and nocturnal HR elevation) may reflect lifestyle choices (e.g., evening activity or schedule) rather than stress per se. Several correlations in the dataset are small in magnitude, so individual measures should not be overinterpreted in isolation. Finally, wearable-derived circadian metrics are aggregate summaries and do not replace day-level contextual information (e.g., exam periods, acute stressors) that could transiently increase perceived stress."
95490,"Summary of data sources and approach: The following synthesis integrates self-report trait and symptom measures, lifestyle items, and wearable-derived sleep and heart-rate/circadian metrics collected across the semester. I emphasize features with substantial Z-scores or established correlations with perceived stress and explicitly consider evidence that would pull inferred Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) upward (greater perceived stress) and evidence that would pull it downward (lower perceived stress). Where possible I reference the relative magnitude of signals (Z-scores, classification labels, and correlations) and avoid over-interpretation of single weak associations.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait and symptom measures: The participant’s trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56, classified “anxious”) and mild depressive symptom score (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07) are both positively associated with PSS in the sample (STAI–PSS corr ≈ 0.31; CES-D–PSS corr ≈ 0.28). Lower self-reported happiness (Current = 3.0, Z = -0.53; corr ≈ -0.19) and somewhat lower self-esteem (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59; corr ≈ -0.15) also map in the direction of greater perceived stress in this dataset.
- Subjective sleep disturbance and sleep timing variability: The PSQI score (6, classified “Disturbed Sleep”) crosses the common clinical threshold indicating poorer subjective sleep; sleep timing is late (median start ≈ 01:11) and sleep-start variability is elevated (SD ≈ 101 minutes, Z ≈ 0.4, corr with PSS ≈ 0.17). Both disturbed subjective sleep and irregular bedtimes have modest positive associations with higher PSS in the sample.
- Circadian/physiological markers of irregularity and arousal: Heart-rate–based circadian regularity is reduced (Interdaily stability = 0.23, Z = -1.48), and intradaily variability is elevated (0.60, Z = 0.39). Lower interdaily stability and greater fragmentation map to increases in perceived stress in the cohort (correlations in the expected direction). Resting heart rate is somewhat above the sample mean (61.4 bpm, Z = 0.39) and hours in the early morning (around 4–7am) show relatively large negative deviations from mesor with modest positive correlations to PSS, consistent with altered nocturnal physiology that relates to stress. Together these wearable features indicate a circadian/physiological profile that has been linked here with higher perceived stress.
- Behavioral/lifestyle signals: Frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more; Z ≈ 1.07) and relatively frequent alcohol use (beer and wine 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0) may reflect coping behaviors or routines associated with stress in some individuals; their correlations with PSS in the sample are small but in directions that do not clearly protect against stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Functional and behavioral strengths: The participant maintains regular health-related functioning in several domains that often buffer stress: academic performance indicators (GPAs in the mid–high 3.0s) suggest preserved cognitive/academic functioning; exercise frequency (three times/week or more) is a commonly protective behavior and is above population mean (Z ≈ 1.07), which is consistent with better stress regulation for many people.
- Lack of more severe psychopathology and limited risky substance use: CES-D is in the non-clinical range and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent or reported as “not at all” (Z-scores negative), which reduce the likelihood that very high PSS would be driven by severe depressive disorder or substance-related difficulties. Resting heart rate is within a typical range despite being slightly elevated relative to the sample mean, and daytime heart-rate peaks (late afternoon/evening) are pronounced but not uniquely linked to higher PSS in this sample (hourly correlations around zero during peak daytime hours).
- Social engagement: Reported socializing time is higher than average (2–3 hours, Z ≈ 0.95), which can serve as a social buffer against perceived stress even if exercise with others is infrequent.

Holistic assessment and comparison to the study sample mean PSS
Balancing the lines of evidence, multiple moderately weighted indicators point toward greater perceived stress (elevated trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, low interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythms, and modestly higher resting HR). These signals are complemented by lower happiness and lower self-esteem, both of which are associated with higher PSS in the sample. Offsetting these factors are several protective or neutral elements (adequate exercise frequency, preserved academic functioning, absent recreational drug use, and moderate socializing), and symptom scores are not extreme (CES-D in the non-clinical range). Taken together, the preponderance of evidence supports an inferred perceived stress level that is modestly above the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61). In plain terms: based on the convergent pattern of elevated trait anxiety, subjective sleep disturbance and circadian irregularity, the participant’s inferred PSS is most consistent with being above the population mean rather than near or below it, but not at a markedly extreme level relative to the cohort.

Caveats and recommended next steps
This inference is probabilistic: it is based on trait and behavioral proxies and wearable-derived group-aggregated heart-rate patterns rather than a contemporaneous PSS score for the participant. Where possible, direct measurement of the participant’s PSS and longitudinal assessment of sleep timing, night-to-night heart-rate variability, and daytime stressors would strengthen confidence in this estimate. If the aim is to reduce perceived stress, prioritized targets suggested by the data are stabilizing sleep timing (regularizing bedtime), addressing trait anxiety (psychological skills or counseling), and supporting sleep quality; these align with the strongest convergent signals linking the participant’s physiology and self-report to higher perceived stress."
90079,"Summary of key measurements: The participant shows several convergent signals from self-report and wearable data relevant to perceived stress. Subjectively, the participant’s CES-D (14) and STAI–Trait (38) scores are near or below the study mean (z = 0.07 and z = −0.33, respectively), while the PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (score 7, z = 0.13). Wearable-derived sleep is short and variable: median nightly sleep is 5 h 54 min (z = −1.59) with a large sleep start-time standard deviation (~104 minutes, z = 0.46). Circadian/HR summary metrics point to reduced regularity and a damped rhythm: interdaily stability is low (0.21, z = −1.65), intradaily variability (fragmentation) is elevated (0.75, z = 1.44), amplitude is low (6.53, z = −1.37), and resting heart rate is modestly higher than the sample mean (65.6 bpm, z = 0.89). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show relatively lower HR during overnight hours and relatively higher evening HR elevations; these values are temporally aggregated and should be interpreted as typical time-of-day arousal patterns rather than time-trend effects.

Evidence that aligns with relatively higher perceived stress: Several objective physiological and behavioral markers linked in the literature with greater perceived stress are present. Short median sleep duration (≈5 h 54 min, z = −1.59) and subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7) are both associated with higher stress and poorer recovery. The circadian summary suggests a less stable and more fragmented daily rhythm (low interdaily stability z = −1.65; high intradaily variability z = 1.44), which correlates in this dataset with higher PSS (intradaily variability correlation ≈ 0.16; interdaily stability correlation ≈ −0.11). Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (z = 0.89) and shows a small positive correlation with PSS (r ≈ 0.14), consistent with higher tonic physiological arousal. In addition, variability in sleep timing (sleep start SD z ≈ 0.46) and greater day-to-day sleep duration variability (SD = 138 min, z = 0.84) can reflect irregular schedules and are weakly associated with higher PSS in these data. Finally, although trait anxiety and depressive symptom scores are not elevated, their correlations with PSS in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28) indicate that even modest elevations in these domains would tend to co-occur with perceived stress; CES-D here is near average and STAI is slightly below average.

Evidence that aligns with relatively lower perceived stress: Several behavioral and self-report indicators point toward protective factors or at least absence of strong psychological distress. The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use; z-scores well below sample means), which is typically associated with lower stress-related risk. Trait measures do not indicate high depression or anxiety (CES-D and STAI near or below sample mean), and self-esteem is only modestly lower than average (RSES = 34, z = −0.59) rather than markedly low. Social and recreational engagement is present at moderate levels (socializing ~1–2 hours; listening to music 1–2 hours), which can be mixed but often supports coping. The pattern of hourly HR deviation—marked overnight reductions in HR and predictable evening increases—also reflects retained basic circadian structure rather than a complete desynchronization. Taken together, these elements reduce the likelihood of very high perceived stress compared with someone showing broad elevations across subjective and physiological domains.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the profile suggests an elevated but not extreme level of perceived stress relative to the study sample. Objective sleep restriction, disturbed subjective sleep, reduced interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, and a modestly higher resting heart rate are salient indicators that point toward greater perceived stress. Counterbalancing these are generally non-elevated depressive and trait-anxiety scores, low substance use, and moderate social engagement. Given the mix of signals—with several physiological and sleep features deviating meaningfully from the sample mean while psychological symptom scores remain closer to or below average—the most parsimonious inference is that this participant’s perceived stress is likely above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68), but probably not an extreme outlier. In other words, inferred PSS is most consistent with a moderately above-mean level rather than far above or below the sample average.

Uncertainty and contextual notes: This interpretation weighs wearable-derived circadian and sleep disturbance heavily because they are robustly and independently associated with perceived stress in this dataset, but correlations in the study are modest and do not prove causation. Hourly heart-rate values are aggregated across days and should not be read as evidence about specific stressful episodes. If a more precise estimate of current PSS is required, the direct PSS score (if available) or repeated self-report assessments would reduce uncertainty; in the absence of a direct PSS value, the pattern above supports targeted attention to sleep regularity, sleep duration, and circadian stabilization as potential intervention targets to reduce perceived stress."
22842,"High-stress indicators: several self-report and wearable-derived features point toward elevated perceived stress. The participant’s CES-D score (20; Z = 0.7) falls in a range labeled “Depressed” in the scoring summary and correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28), and trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = 0.46) is modestly elevated and also positively correlated with PSS (r ≈ 0.31). Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 10; Z = 1.52), which is commonly associated with greater perceived stress. Behavioral markers of irregularity—particularly a late median sleep start time (~02:56) with large night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 164 minutes; Z = 1.79) and an unusually high mean daily nap rate (0.28; Z = 2.4)—are also consistent with stress-related dysregulation of sleep and circadian timing. Wearable circadian metrics additionally show reduced interdaily stability (0.30; Z = −0.9), suggesting a weak day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms; lower regularity has been associated with higher stress in population analyses. Together, these patterns (elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, poor subjective sleep, irregular sleep timing, and high nap frequency) point toward factors that would tend to increase perceived stress.

Low-stress / protective indicators: other data indicate behavioral and physiological resources that may buffer stress. Median nocturnal sleep duration is relatively long (7 h 51 m; Z = 0.83), which is generally protective for mood and stress regulation despite poor subjective sleep quality. The participant reports frequent solo exercise (three times a week or more; Z = 1.07), low substance and recreational drug use, and moderate health satisfaction (score 5.44 on 1–7 scale; Z = 0.88)—all features that correlate with lower perceived stress or better coping in many samples. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm; Z = −0.47), and overall heart-rate MESOR and amplitude are on the lower side (MESOR 69.3 bpm, Z = −0.63; amplitude 8.7, Z = −0.67); lower resting heart rate and modestly damped cardiac amplitude can reflect better cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline sympathetic tone, which may counterbalance some subjective distress. Socializing time (1–2 hours daily) and low levels of maladaptive recreational behaviors further qualify the profile with moderate psychosocial resources.

Wearable circadian and hourly heart-rate synthesis: the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough across the habitual sleep period (large negative deviations from mesor between ~2:00–8:00 AM) and increased cardiovascular activity in the midday and early evening (notable positive deviations ~12:00–2:00 PM and ~6:00–8:00 PM). A small early-night elevation around 1:00–2:00 AM (positive deviation) coupled with the late average sleep onset (~2:56 AM) suggests a pattern of late-night physiological arousal that matches the self-reported late and variable sleep timing. Non-parametric circadian features indicate lower interdaily stability and moderately low intradaily variability (intradaily variability = 0.46; Z = −0.6), a pattern consistent with an overall irregular schedule but without extreme fragmentation of activity. Correlations between several of these wearable features and PSS in the study sample are modest in magnitude, so the circadian data provide supporting but not conclusive evidence regarding perceived stress.

Integrated conclusion and comparison to the study mean: weighing the evidence, the balance favors an inference of perceived stress above the study population mean. Elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D), higher trait anxiety (STAI), disturbed subjective sleep (PSQI), pronounced variability in sleep timing, and a high nap rate are salient indicators that align with higher PSS in the sample. Protective features—adequate median sleep duration, frequent exercise, low substance use, reasonable health satisfaction, and relatively low resting heart rate—mitigate that risk but do not fully offset the stress-related signals. On balance, the profile is most consistent with perceived stress above the population mean (population PSS mean = 21.61). This interpretation is probabilistic and correlational: it integrates multiple converging signals from self-report and wearables but does not substitute for a direct PSS score or clinical assessment."
14279,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile contains mixed signals but overall tilts toward lower perceived stress when compared with the study sample. Objective wearable measures show a robust, regular circadian signal (high amplitude, elevated interdaily regularity and 24-hr autocorrelation) and relatively long, consistent sleep duration, while self-report symptom measures (CES-D, STAI Trait, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem) are all on the favorable side of the study distribution. Countervailing evidence includes a clinically elevated PSQI (subjective sleep disturbance), modestly reduced self-reported current happiness, and a somewhat elevated intradaily variability metric from the wearable data. Taken together, the balance of evidence supports an inferred perceived stress level below the population mean PSS for this study sample.

Features consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Subjective sleep quality is disturbed (PSQI = 7), which commonly co-occurs with greater perceived stress and can amplify daytime distress even when objective sleep duration is long. Intradaily variability (value 0.62; Z = 0.53) is elevated relative to the sample and has a positive correlation with PSS in this dataset, suggesting greater within-day fragmentation of physiological activity that can reflect or exacerbate daily stress reactivity. Self-reported current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (score = 3.0; Z = -0.53), and trust is low (Z = -1.74); both features—especially lower momentary well-being—are often associated with higher perceived stress. Finally, some small positive correlations between early-morning heart-rate deviations and PSS (e.g., 3–6am) indicate that nocturnal physiology has a small association with higher stress for this sample; while these correlations are modest, they are consistent with the PSQI finding.

Features consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are low (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86; STAI-Trait = 38, Z = -0.33), each of which typically covary positively with perceived stress; their low values argue against high PSS. Self-esteem is maximal on the scale (Rosenberg = 40; Z = 0.26), which is inversely related to perceived stress in this population. Objectively measured sleep duration is long (median 8 h 11 min; Z = 1.24) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep SD Z = -0.19), and resting heart rate is normal-to-low (59 bpm), all of which commonly index better recovery and lower chronic stress load. Circadian features support physiological regularity: amplitude is high (Z = 1.11), interdaily stability and 24-hr autocorrelation are above average (Z = 0.58 and 0.81, respectively), and these particular metrics in this sample are negatively correlated with PSS—i.e., stronger, more regular rhythms are associated with lower perceived stress.

Physiology and daily pattern interpretation: Heart-rate-based circadian timing shows a clear daytime acrophase (~4:05 PM) with pronounced daytime elevations and deep nighttime troughs in aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor. The large negative deviations at night and large positive midday/evening deviations (several time bins with high positive Z-scores) are consistent with consolidated sleep and clear wake activity windows. High amplitude and strong 24-hour autocorrelation reinforce that the participant’s autonomic/behavioral schedule is structured and consistent across days—features that tend to be protective against sustained perceived stress. The elevated intradaily variability, however, suggests some within-day fragmentation (e.g., brief activity spikes or irregularities), which could reflect episodic stressors, variable activity patterns, or measurement noise; this pattern partially tempers the otherwise regular circadian picture.

Holistic conclusion relative to the study population mean PSS: Integrating behavioral, psychological, and physiological data, the participant’s profile most consistently aligns with perceived stress below the study sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.62). The strongest evidence for lower perceived stress is low depressive and anxiety scores, high self-esteem, long and regular objective sleep, and pronounced circadian amplitude/regularity—metrics that correlate negatively with PSS in this dataset. Elevated PSQI, reduced momentary happiness, and increased intradaily variability provide important caveats and indicate areas of vulnerability where perceived stress could increase under strain. Limitations: this is an inference rather than a direct PSS measurement; some correlations are small and directionalities are associative, and subjective and objective sleep indices conflict (objective long sleep vs. subjective disturbance), so conclusions should be interpreted cautiously and considered hypothesis-generating rather than diagnostic."
28327,"Summary: The combined self-report and wearable data indicate a mixed but ultimately weighted profile consistent with elevated perceived stress relative to the study sample. Several strong self-report indicators (high depressive symptom burden, elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, poor subjective sleep quality, low reported happiness and low health satisfaction) point toward greater psychological strain. Wearable-derived physiology and sleep show some preserved elements of restorative physiology (regular nocturnal heart-rate decline and adequate median sleep duration), but also reveal markers of circadian fragmentation and pronounced evening physiological activation that are commonly associated with greater stress and irregular daily demands. Taken together, the balance of evidence supports an inference that this participant’s perceived stress is above the study population mean (population mean PSS = 21.61).

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress
- Clinical symptom measures: The CES-D score (33; Z = 2.05, classified as depressed) and STAI–Trait score (58; Z = 1.65, classified as anxious) are both markedly elevated relative to the sample. These scales have positive correlations with PSS in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31), and their magnitude is a primary signal supporting higher perceived stress.  
- Low self-regard and low positive affect: Rosenberg self-esteem is low (score 26; Z = -1.71), and current self-reported happiness is low (score 2; Z = -1.61). These negatively correlated features (self-esteem r ≈ -0.15; happiness r ≈ -0.19) are consistent with greater perceived stress and reduced psychological resilience.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The PSQI is elevated (9; Z = 1.05, classified as disturbed sleep), indicating the participant reports difficulties with sleep despite wearable-recorded duration. Poor subjective sleep quality often accompanies higher perceived stress and depressive/anxious symptomatology.  
- Circadian/variability markers associated with stress: Intradaily variability (0.69; Z = 1.02) is relatively high, suggesting greater fragmentation of heart-rate rhythms within days; this metric correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.16) and is interpreted as a physiological correlate of irregular activity/arousal patterns that accompany stress. Evening heart-rate elevations (large positive deviations from the mesor in the 6–8 pm window, Z-scores up to ~2.24) further indicate pronounced late-day physiological activation that can reflect evening stress, activity, or arousal.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress
- Objective nocturnal physiology and sleep duration: Wearable-derived median sleep duration is slightly above average for the sample (7 h 37 m; Z = 0.54) and the hourly heart-rate deviations show robust nocturnal declines (large negative deviations overnight), consistent with preserved nocturnal cardiovascular down-regulation. Resting heart rate is within a typical range (60.2 bpm; Z = 0.24). These objective features argue against severe autonomic dysregulation and suggest some maintenance of restorative sleep physiology.  
- Between-day regularity: Interdaily stability is moderately above the sample mean (0.49; Z = 0.67), implying some regularity to daily timing patterns across days. Regular day-to-day structure can buffer perceived stress, even when within-day fragmentation is present.  
- Moderate behavioral health indicators: Alcohol use is modest (beer/wine/liquor 1–2 times/week), recreational and non-prescribed drug use are reported as none, and the participant engages in exercise/sports at low-to-moderate frequencies. These behaviors do not suggest high levels of substance-related coping that would otherwise amplify stress indicators.

Integrated interpretation and comparison to the study sample
Weighing the evidence, the strongest and most salient signals are the elevated depressive and anxious symptom scores, low self-esteem and low happiness, and the participant’s subjective report of poor sleep quality — all of which are established, moderately correlated predictors of higher perceived stress in this sample. Wearable data temper but do not overturn that conclusion: objective sleep duration and overnight heart-rate decline are reasonably preserved (a mitigating sign), but increased intraday heart-rate variability/fragmentation and notable evening physiological activation point to within-day arousal and irregularity consistent with elevated stress. On balance, the data are most consistent with perceived stress that is above the sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.61; SD = 3.68). The participant’s pattern suggests meaningful psychological distress and physiological markers of arousal that align with higher-than-average perceived stress in this academic semester context.

Notes on uncertainty and interpretation
- Correlations reported in the dataset are modest in magnitude and do not determine individual-level classification; the inferential conclusion prioritizes the large self-report elevations (CES-D, STAI) and their clinical meaning.  
- Objective and subjective sleep measures diverge (adequate objective duration vs. elevated PSQI); this discrepancy is important clinically and may reflect sleep quality, sleep timing, or cognitive/affective factors (worry, rumination) that reduce perceived restorative sleep.  
- Circadian metrics are aggregated across the recording period and do not reflect temporal trends; the interpretation focuses on between-day regularity versus within-day fragmentation rather than change over time.

Overall, the evidence supports concluding that this participant’s perceived stress is likely above the study population mean, with prominent psychological symptom burden and within-day physiological markers driving that inference despite some preserved nocturnal physiology and day-to-day regularity."
52302,"Summary and context: The participant’s data present a mixed profile of psychological trait measures, self-reported behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological rhythms. Using the study sample PSS distribution (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68) as a reference point, the overall pattern of evidence best supports an inferred perceived-stress level near the population mean. This conclusion balances several modest indicators of elevated stress (notably trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance) against multiple physiological and behavioral markers that are typically associated with lower perceived stress or good functional adaptation.

Features that favor relatively higher perceived stress
- Trait anxiety (STAI–Trait = 43, Z ≈ 0.17) is above the study mean and correlates moderately with PSS in this sample (r ≈ 0.31). This indicates a stable tendency toward anxiety proneness that can contribute to higher perceived stress.  
- Subjective sleep quality is classified as “Disturbed” on the PSQI (score = 6), which commonly aligns with greater perceived stress; PSQI is a commonly reported correlate of stress. The participant also shows moderate night-to-night variability in sleep start times (SD ≈ 103 minutes, Z ≈ 0.43) and sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 123 minutes, Z ≈ 0.51), and variability in timing/regularity is often associated with higher stress or dysregulated routines.  
- Some behavioral markers that may weakly favor more stress: limited frequency of exercise/sport (exercising alone/with others and sports ~1–2×/week) and a late median sleep start time (median 01:07), which can reflect schedule strain or circadian misalignment in academic populations.

Features that favor relatively lower perceived stress
- Depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 7, Z ≈ −0.66; classified “Not depressed”), and self-esteem and self-rated happiness are above average (Rosenberg score 39, Z ≈ 0.11; happiness 4.0, Z ≈ 0.55). These self-report indicators typically protect against higher perceived stress, and several of these measures have negative or small correlations with PSS in the sample.  
- Wearable cardiovascular metrics suggest lower tonic physiological arousal: resting heart rate is relatively low (RHR = 52.5 bpm, Z ≈ −0.67), which commonly reflects better cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline sympathetic tone and is generally associated with lower perceived stress. The heart-rate circadian amplitude is higher than average (amplitude Z ≈ 0.50) and intradaily variability is lower than average (IV Z ≈ −0.95); a pronounced circadian amplitude with low fragmentation is often linked to more robust diurnal organization and lower stress vulnerability.  
- Objective sleep quantity is above average (median nightly sleep ≈ 8 h 6 min, Z ≈ 1.14). Although subjective sleep quality is disturbed, the objectively long median sleep duration and low mean daily naps (0.13, Z ≈ 0.7 but small absolute) suggest the participant obtains substantive sleep opportunity, which can mitigate stress effects.  
- Lifestyle supports: minimal substance use (no reported beer, wine/liquor, or recreational/non-prescribed drug use), relatively high social time reported (socializing 3–4 hours, Z ≈ 1.74), and modestly positive health satisfaction are behavioral factors that commonly align with lower perceived stress.

Interpretation of wearable circadian and hourly heart-rate pattern
- The cosinor-derived acrophase (~5:17 PM) and a relatively large amplitude indicate a clear diurnal pattern with afternoon/evening peaks in heart rate. Aggregated hourly deviations show the largest positive departures from mesor in early to mid-afternoon (1–3 PM, Z-scores for those hours ≈ 1.5–1.8) and strong nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations in early morning). The pronounced daytime peaks and strong night-time reductions together indicate an organized, high-amplitude circadian rhythm of cardiovascular activity. In this sample, higher amplitude and clearer daytime–nighttime separation were associated with lower PSS, so these features are a protective signal for perceived stress in this participant.  
- Interdaily stability is slightly below the sample mean (0.37, Z ≈ −0.33), which may reflect some day-to-day scheduling variability. Because interdaily stability tends to correlate negatively (or weakly) with stress, this modest reduction is a small potential risk factor. However, the participant’s low intradaily variability and reasonably strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z ≈ 0.14) temper concerns about major circadian disruption.

Holistic conclusion and uncertainty
- Taking all evidence together, the participant shows some indicators that would tend to raise perceived stress (trait anxiety mildly elevated, subjectively disturbed sleep, variability in sleep timing) but also multiple and relatively strong indicators that point toward lower perceived stress (low resting heart rate, robust circadian amplitude with clear daytime peaks, above-average sleep duration, low depressive symptoms, good self-esteem and happiness, minimal substance use, and substantial social time). Given the mixed but balanced evidence, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study sample mean PSS (≈21.62). There is not a clear, consistent signal indicating markedly higher-than-average PSS, nor is there unequivocal evidence of substantially lower-than-average PSS; the profile best matches an average level of perceived stress with some resilience factors offsetting modest vulnerability.  
- Degree of confidence: moderate. Correlational guidance provided with the dataset helped weigh features, but these are probabilistic relationships and subjective factors (reported PSQI disturbance vs. objectively long sleep) introduce uncertainty. If a narrower classification is required, the aggregate pattern leans slightly toward below-mean stress protection but not by a margin large enough to state “below the population mean” definitively; therefore “near the mean” is the most accurate summary.

Notes on interpretation limits
- These inferences synthesize cross-sectional trait scores, global correlations with PSS, and aggregated wearable metrics. They are probabilistic and not diagnostic. Subjective reports (PSQI, STAI) and objective measures (wearable circadian features, RHR) should be interpreted together: where they diverge (e.g., long objective sleep vs. disturbed subjective sleep), both signals matter and may indicate aspects of sleep quality or stress perception not captured by wearables alone."
46418,"Summary and overall inference:
Integrating self-report and wearable-derived data yields a mixed but coherent pattern. Objective physiological and behavioral indicators (regular sleep duration, low fragmentation of day–night heart rate patterns, robust circadian amplitude, frequent group exercise) align with relatively good behavioral regulation and lower physiological signs of chronic arousal. In contrast, subjective reports show elevated sleep disturbance (PSQI = 11, z ≈ 1.98) and modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 18, z ≈ 0.49), though trait anxiety (STAI = 38, z ≈ -0.33) and self-esteem (RSES = 38, z ≈ -0.03) are not elevated. Balancing these sources, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress appears near the study population mean PSS (population mean = 21.61). If forced to place relative to the sample mean, the combined evidence is most consistent with perceived stress “near the mean,” with some indicators pulling in opposite directions.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
- Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 11, z ≈ 1.98), a strong signal of disturbed sleep-related experience that is commonly associated with higher perceived stress and is likely to inflate self-reported stress even when objective sleep duration appears adequate.  
- Depressive symptoms are above the sample average (CES-D = 18, z ≈ 0.49); CES-D correlates positively with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.28), so this elevation supports greater perceived stress.  
- Lower self-rated physical health satisfaction (score ≈ 2.67, z ≈ -1.2) may contribute to subjective strain and a tendency to report more stress.  
- Evening peaks in heart rate deviation are large (e.g., 5–6 pm deviation ≈ +26 bpm, z ≈ 2.27), which could reflect periods of higher physiological activation late in the day and, for some individuals, correspond to time-specific stressors or activity patterns that increase perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
- Wearable circadian metrics indicate well-organized rhythms: interdaily stability is above average (0.53, z ≈ 1.0), intradaily variability is low (0.30, z ≈ -1.73), and cosinor amplitude is relatively high (amplitude ≈ 15.07, z ≈ 1.39). These features are generally associated with healthier circadian regulation and tend to correlate with lower PSS in the sample (amplitude r ≈ -0.17; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.12).  
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity are adequate: median nightly sleep ≈ 7 h 44 m (z ≈ 0.69) with relatively low night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 64 minutes, z ≈ -0.84) and low nap frequency. Regular and sufficient sleep duration is protective against higher perceived stress.  
- Resting heart rate is low–normal (≈ 57.8 bpm, z ≈ -0.04), and the overall mesor is not elevated, suggesting no pervasive elevation of cardiac baseline arousal.  
- Behavioral health behaviors are supportive: frequent exercise, especially exercising with others and regular sports participation (z-scores > +1 for these activity measures), and moderate social/leisure engagement are factors typically associated with lower perceived stress.

Integration and concluding statement:
The data present a split picture: subjective distress (poor reported sleep, modest depressive symptoms, and low health satisfaction) points to higher perceived stress, while objective behavioral and physiological markers (stable, high-amplitude circadian rhythms; adequate and consistent sleep duration; frequent exercise; low resting HR) point to lower perceived stress. Given the relative strengths of the objective circadian/behavioral signals and the moderate magnitude of the self-report elevations, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study population mean PSS (21.61) rather than clearly above or below it. In other words: near the mean, with some subjective symptoms suggesting periodic or domain-specific stress that may not be reflected as a global, chronically elevated physiological stress state.

Notes on uncertainty and follow-up:
This inference synthesizes multiple modalities but is inherently probabilistic. If a more definitive assessment is needed, direct measurement of the participant’s PSS score and repeated subjective stress sampling (ecological momentary assessment) would reduce uncertainty and clarify whether subjective sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms represent transient states or a persistent elevation in perceived stress."
93002,"Summary: The participant's multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals. Subjective measures indicate disturbed sleep (PSQI = 9, z = +1.05) and modest elevations on measures that typically co-occur with perceived stress (CES-D = 14, z ≈ 0.07; STAI–Trait = 40, z ≈ -0.13, classified as “anxious”), together with lower self‑esteem (Rosenberg = 32, z = -0.87) and somewhat lower reported happiness (current = 3.0, z = -0.53). Wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics show relatively low tonic cardiovascular activity (resting HR = 48.3 bpm, z = -1.18; MESOR = 64.9, z = -1.24), good day-to-day rhythm regularity (interdaily stability = 0.49, z = +0.67; autocorrelation at 24h = 0.42, z = +0.81), and a pattern of late sleep timing (median sleep start ~01:16) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 103 minutes, z = +0.43). Below I outline the specific features that point toward higher versus lower perceived stress and then integrate them into an overall comparison with the study sample mean PSS score (mean = 21.61, SD = 3.68).

Features suggesting relatively higher perceived stress: - Subjective sleep disturbance is one of the clearest stress‑related signals. A PSQI score of 9 (z = +1.05) indicates clinically meaningful poor sleep quality, and the participant’s median nightly sleep duration is short (6 h 28 min, z = -0.88) with sizable variability (sleep duration SD = 120 min, z = +0.43). Late habitual sleep onset (median start ≈ 01:16) and elevated nap frequency (mean daily naps = 0.18, z = +1.21) can reflect compensatory behavior and circadian misalignment that are commonly associated with higher perceived stress. - Self-report markers that correlate positively with PSS in this sample (STAI trait r ≈ 0.31; CES‑D r ≈ 0.28) are present at or slightly above typical values for the cohort (anxious classification on STAI, CES‑D = 14), and lower self‑esteem (z = -0.87) and reduced happiness (z = -0.53) are additional psychosocial features that tend to accompany higher perceived stress. - Wearable-derived intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.58, z = +0.24) and has a small positive correlation with PSS in the sample; some early‑morning heart‑rate deviations (e.g., 4–6 am) show positive correlations with PSS (r ≈ 0.19–0.22), which may indicate subtle physiological reactivity in those windows that aligns with higher stress.

Features suggesting relatively lower perceived stress: - Several objective cardiovascular and circadian indicators suggest lower physiological arousal and greater temporal organization, both of which are generally associated with lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate is well below the cohort mean (48.3 bpm, z = -1.18), and MESOR is also low (64.9, z = -1.24), consistent with lower tonic cardiac activation (often seen with higher cardiovascular fitness or lower sympathetic tone). These variables in this sample show either weak positive correlations with PSS (resting HR r ≈ 0.14) or no strong relation, but the participant’s values are substantially lower than average, which typically argues against high chronic physiological stress. - Circadian regularity metrics are relatively favorable: interdaily stability (z = +0.67) and autocorrelation at 24 h (z = +0.81) indicate consistent day‑to‑day heart‑rate rhythms. In this cohort those rhythm-regularity measures are negatively correlated with PSS (r ≈ -0.12 to -0.17), so the participant’s above-average regularity is a protective indicator. - Low engagement in substance use (no reported alcohol or recreational drugs) and avoidance of sedentary hobbies are behavioral factors that do not suggest elevated stress‑related coping through substance use or marked withdrawal.

Integrated interpretation and uncertainty: The profile shows competing signals. Subjective sleep disturbance, late/variable sleep timing, increased napping, reduced self‑esteem, and modest elevation on depressive and trait‑anxiety measures point toward psychosocial strain that commonly co-occurs with higher perceived stress. Conversely, relatively low resting heart rate and a strongly regular, structured circadian heart‑rate pattern point toward lower physiological arousal and greater behavioral regularity—features that typically co-occur with lower perceived stress. The wearable physiology does not strongly mirror the subjective sleep complaints (i.e., objective rhythm regularity is relatively preserved despite poor subjective sleep), which introduces some uncertainty: subjective distress about sleep can increase perceived stress even when objective circadian structure is intact.

Overall comparison to the study population mean PSS: Balancing these lines of evidence, the participant’s inferred perceived stress level is best characterized as near the study sample mean, with a plausible tendency toward being slightly above the mean. In other words, compared to the sample mean PSS = 21.61 (SD = 3.68), the data do not point strongly to markedly lower or markedly higher perceived stress but suggest an overall level that is approximately at or modestly above the cohort average — primarily driven by subjective sleep disturbance, late/variable sleep timing, and psychosocial indicators (self‑esteem/happiness), while somewhat mitigated by low resting heart rate and preserved circadian regularity. This assessment carries uncertainty and would be strengthened by a concurrent PSS score for the participant and by longitudinal linkage of subjective sleep complaints to specific nights of elevated physiological arousal."
56543,"Summary of indicators consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several self-report measures and wearable-derived physiologic markers point toward elevated stress proneness relative to the study sample. Trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) and depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 18, Z = 0.49) are both above the sample mean and are positively correlated with PSS in this dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.31; CES-D r ≈ 0.28), which suggests psychological vulnerability that commonly accompanies higher perceived stress. Subjective sleep quality is poor (PSQI = 9, Z = 1.05), and median nightly sleep duration is below the sample mean (6 h 26 min, Z = -0.94); poor sleep and shorter sleep tend to co-occur with higher perceived stress in this sample. Physiologically, resting heart rate and mesor are elevated (RHR = 68 bpm, Z = 1.17; mesor = 82.27, Z = 1.14), consistent with modestly higher baseline autonomic activation that correlates positively with PSS (RHR r ≈ 0.13). Late-night physiological arousal is pronounced: aggregated hourly deviations show very large positive heart-rate deviations in the late evening (notably 10–11 pm deviation = +44.16, Z = 5.94; 9–10 pm and 11–12 am also elevated), and the participant’s median sleep start time is very late (~02:22). High evening arousal and delayed sleep timing are both compatible with behavioral and physiological patterns that tend to accompany higher perceived stress. High daily internet use (>4 hours, Z = 2.19) and measurable intradaily variability in circadian signals (IV = 0.59, Z = 0.32; IV correlates with PSS r ≈ 0.16) are additional behavioral/chronobiologic features that, in this dataset, modestly associate with higher reported stress.

Summary of indicators consistent with relatively lower perceived stress (protective features): The profile also contains several features that would ordinarily mitigate perceived stress. The participant reports frequent exercise alone (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), a behavior that is generally protective against stress and shows little or no positive correlation with PSS here. Substance use is absent (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs; negative Z-scores), removing a common behavioral risk factor for stress-related worsening. Measures of day-to-day circadian regularity show moderately high interdaily stability (IS = 0.49, Z = 0.67), which in this sample is associated with lower PSS (IS r ≈ -0.12) and suggests some consistency in daily structure. Self-reported satisfaction with physical health is relatively high (health satisfaction Z = 0.88), and time spent reading (2–3 hours, extreme positive Z = 4.24) and listening to music may reflect adaptive leisure or coping activities; reading in particular shows a negative correlation with PSS (r ≈ -0.23) in this dataset.

Interpretation of circadian and heart-rate patterning: The cosinor-derived features show a modestly elevated mesor and a normal amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ 0.02), with an acrophase in the early evening (~6:44 PM). Elevated mesor and higher resting heart rate together indicate a higher overall cardiovascular setpoint across days. Interdaily stability is above average while autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (autocorr24 Z = -0.36), suggesting that although there is some regularity across days, there is also reduced strict 24-hour predictability and modest within-day fragmentation (IV elevated). The hourly aggregated deviations expose a large evening peak in heart rate (very large Z at 10–11 pm), and substantial negative deviations during early morning sleep hours. This pattern (high evening arousal plus late sleep onset ~2:20 am) is consistent with behavioral late-night activation (e.g., screen use) and may maintain or exacerbate subjective sleep disturbance and perceived stress.

Balanced behavioral context and likely functional impact: The participant shows a mix of risk and protective behaviors. Protective behaviors — regular exercise, low substance use, socializing and leisure (music, reading) — may buffer stress responses. However, the constellation of elevated trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, objectively higher resting cardiac activation, disturbed subjective sleep, late sleep timing, and very high evening physiological arousal favors greater perceived stress burden. High internet use and elevated intradaily variability further point to lifestyle patterns that may sustain evening arousal and impair restorative sleep, thereby feeding into perceived stress.

Overall inference relative to the sample mean PSS: Considering the converging psychological, behavioral, and physiologic signals (elevated STAI and CES-D, poor PSQI, elevated resting HR and mesor, late sleep timing and marked evening HR elevation), the profile is most consistent with a perceived stress level above the study population mean (population PSS mean = 21.61). The evidence is not uniformly extreme (some protective features are present), but the balance of risk-indicating measures supports an inference of above-average perceived stress compared with the sample."
89142,"Summary and overall inference:
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant presents a mixed profile with signals pointing both toward elevated perceived stress and toward resilience. Trait anxiety is moderately elevated (STAI = 48; Z = +0.66), subjective health satisfaction is very low (health satisfaction = 1; Z = −2.45), and nocturnal sleep duration is short on average (median 5 h 50 min; Z = −1.68). Taken together with low self-reported happiness and limited social/exercise behaviors, these findings suggest perceived stress is likely somewhat higher than typical for the study sample. On balance, I infer the participant’s overall perceived stress level is modestly above the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.67), i.e., above the study sample average rather than clearly below or far above it.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress:
Several indicators that tend to co-occur with elevated PSS are present. Trait anxiety is above the sample mean (STAI Z = +0.66) and STAI has a moderate positive correlation with PSS in this dataset (r ≈ 0.34), making it a salient signal of greater perceived stress. Subjective health satisfaction is extremely low (Z = −2.45), and although its correlation with PSS is small (r ≈ −0.12), the magnitude of deviation from the population on this item is notable and commonly aligns with increased perceived stress. Objective sleep is short (median < 6 hours, Z = −1.68) and sleep duration variability is relatively high (SD = 123 minutes; Z = +0.51); short and irregular sleep patterns are frequently associated with higher stress and daytime dysfunction. Behavioral lifestyle features that can amplify stress—minimal reported exercise (exercise Zs around −1.6 to −1.9), limited socializing (Z ≈ −0.62), and low current happiness (Z ≈ −0.53)—also point toward a context in which perceived stress is likely elevated.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress:
There are several countervailing signals that indicate resilience or lower perceived stress relative to the sample. Self-reported depressive symptoms are low-to-moderate (CES-D = 12; Z = −0.14) rather than elevated, and subjective sleep quality is rated as “good” (PSQI = 4; Z = −1.26), which often corresponds to fewer stress-related sleep complaints. Wearable circadian metrics show reasonable structure: interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.45; Z = +0.33) and intradaily variability is lower than average (0.44; Z = −0.74), suggesting a stable, less fragmented 24-hour heart-rate rhythm—features that typically relate to better regulatory capacity and lower stress. Resting heart rate and MESOR are both relatively low (resting HR = 45.6 bpm, Z = −1.49; MESOR Z ≈ −1.89), which can reflect cardiovascular fitness and a calmer basal physiology that may mitigate perceived stress. The participant also reports no substance use (alcohol or recreational drugs), an absence of which commonly reduces stress-related risk.

Synthesis and interpretation:
Weighing these signals, the most salient indicators of increased perceived stress are the elevated trait anxiety, very low health satisfaction, short and variable sleep duration, minimal exercise, and lower subjective happiness/social engagement. These features are behaviorally and psychologically meaningful and align with modestly elevated PSS in the study population. However, protective features—including low depressive symptom scores, good subjective sleep quality, stable circadian organization on wearable measures, low resting heart rate, and absence of substance use—attenuate the overall risk profile. Given the mixture of moderately strong risk signals (notably STAI and health satisfaction) and several buffering factors, the most defensible characterization is that the participant’s perceived stress is somewhat above the study sample mean but not extreme. In terms of the study’s population metrics (mean PSS = 21.67, SD = 3.51), the evidence best supports a placement modestly above the mean rather than near the low end or dramatically elevated."
24898,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals. Trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance point toward elevated perceived stress, while objective wearable-derived physiology and structured daily habits (regular circadian rhythms, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, low substance use, and consistent sleep timing) point toward lower perceived stress. Taken together, the balance of evidence suggests the participant’s perceived stress is close to the study sample average; if a directional judgment is required, the pattern is most consistent with a level of perceived stress near the population mean PSS (21.61), perhaps slightly below the mean when objective physiological and behavioral regularity are weighted more heavily.

Evidence consistent with higher perceived stress
- Self-reported anxiety (STAI trait = 45, Z ≈ 0.37) is elevated relative to the sample and is one of the stronger psychological correlates of PSS in this dataset. Trait anxiety tends to co-occur with higher perceived stress and therefore pushes in the direction of greater PSS.
- Subjective sleep problems: PSQI = 6 (classified as “disturbed sleep”) indicates the participant perceives poorer sleep quality. Poor sleep quality commonly associates with higher stress and can amplify daily perceived stress independent of total time asleep.
- Shorter-than-average sleep quantity: median nightly sleep of 6 h 14 min (Z ≈ -1.18) indicates reduced sleep duration relative to the study sample. Short sleep can increase emotional reactivity and perceived stress even when timing is regular.
- Lower self-esteem (Rosenberg score = 31, Z ≈ -1.01) is modestly associated with higher perceived stress in this study (correlation negative for self-esteem), so this trait increases risk for elevated PSS.

Evidence consistent with lower perceived stress
- Strong circadian regularity: interdaily stability is high (0.65, Z ≈ 1.99) and intradaily variability is low (0.34, Z ≈ -1.45). High day-to-day rhythmic stability and low fragmentation of heart rate patterns are associated here with lower PSS and generally reflect stable daily routines and good behavioral organization.
- Robust circadian amplitude and clear daily patterning (amplitude Z ≈ 1.64; acrophase ~4:05 PM) suggest pronounced day–night physiological differentiation, which is typically linked with better recovery and lower stress burden in ambulatory studies.
- Low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z ≈ -1.04) is consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and lower basal physiological arousal, both of which often correspond with lower perceived stress.
- Regular sleep timing with low variability: median sleep start around 00:54 and low SD of start time (Z ≈ -1.07) indicate consistent sleep onset timing, a behavioral pattern associated with reduced circadian disruption and lower stress.
- Health-promoting behaviors and social resources: frequent exercise (exercising alone and with others, sports three times per week or more; positive Z-scores), low substance use, moderate socializing (2–3 hours daily), higher health satisfaction (Z ≈ 0.88), and self-reported current happiness slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.55) all point toward protective behavioral and psychosocial factors that mitigate perceived stress.

Physiological and temporal detail that refines interpretation
- Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines (large negative deviations from mesor overnight) and clear daytime/evening rises (largest positive deviations in mid-afternoon to early evening). The deep nocturnal troughs indicate preserved nocturnal recovery; pronounced daytime peaks reflect expected activity-related increases rather than chronic sympathetic over-activation. Many of these circadian heart rate features have negative correlations with PSS in the sample, which strengthens the interpretation that physiological rhythm robustness is protective in this individual.
- Variability metrics (sleep duration SD ≈ 62 minutes, sleep start SD ≈ 34 minutes) are lower than the population average, indicating consistent sleep patterns. Lower variability in both sleep and heart rate rhythm is more characteristic of lower perceived stress even when absolute sleep duration is modest.

Holistic interpretation and relative position versus the study sample
- The participant presents a mixed profile: subjective measures (elevated trait anxiety, slightly elevated depressive symptom score relative to classification thresholds, and self-reported poor sleep quality) increase the likelihood of higher perceived stress, while objective physiology and stable, healthful behaviors reduce it. Because the objective circadian and fitness indicators are relatively strong (large positive Z for interdaily stability and amplitude; low resting HR), and because lifestyle supports (exercise, low substance use, socialization, health satisfaction) are evident, the overall balance favors an inferred PSS near the study mean rather than clearly high.
- Therefore, compared with the study sample mean PSS of 21.61 (SD = 3.68), the participant’s pattern of data is best described as “near the mean,” with some indicators that could push perceived stress modestly upward (subjective sleep disturbance and trait anxiety) and several stronger indicators that would push it downward (circadian stability, low resting HR, regular routines). If forced to give a directional estimate, the aggregate pattern suggests a perceived stress level close to the mean and possibly slightly below it when objective rhythms and behaviors are given greater weight than self-reported anxieties and sleep complaints.

Clinical and research implications (brief)
- The combination of subjective sleep disturbance and elevated trait anxiety suggests these domains are worth monitoring or targeting in interventions aimed at reducing perceived stress, even though objective physiology and habits are relatively favorable. Interventions that lengthen sleep duration and address cognitive–emotional contributors to anxiety (sleep hygiene, cognitive-behavioral strategies, timing of activities) could meaningfully lower perceived stress for this participant while leveraging existing strengths (exercise routine and stable schedules)."
74413,"Summary and data sources
This profile integrates self-report trait questionnaires, lifestyle items, and wearable-derived sleep and heart-rate rhythmicity collected across an academic term. Overall, the self-report trait measures and objective resting physiology point toward a relatively low level of chronic affective symptoms, while circadian/within-day instability and subjective sleep complaints provide countervailing evidence of elevated momentary arousal. Balancing these signals, the participant’s pattern of indicators is most consistent with a perceived-stress level near the study population mean, leaning slightly below that mean.

Features that suggest relatively greater perceived stress
- Circadian/within-day instability: Intradaily variability (IV = 0.76, Z = 1.51) is meaningfully elevated relative to the sample and has a positive correlation with PSS in the sample (r ≈ 0.17). Elevated IV reflects more fragmentation of activity/heart-rate patterns within days and is associated here with factors that typically accompany higher perceived stress. Interdaily stability is relatively low (0.36, Z = -0.41), which also tends to accompany higher stress (sample correlation r ≈ -0.12).
- Pronounced evening heart-rate elevation: Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show very large positive departures from the mesor in late evening (notably 10–11 pm: +22.05 bpm, Z = 2.46) and elevated values across several afternoon/evening hours. Such evening peaks can reflect increased physiological arousal later in the day, which may relate to rumination, work/academic demands, or schedule-driven stressors; some hourly deviations in the early-morning hours also show modest positive correlations with PSS.
- Subjective sleep disturbance: The participant’s PSQI score is 6 (classified here as “disturbed sleep”), which is above the common clinical cut-off and can reflect perceived problems with sleep that are linked to higher perceived stress even when objective duration appears adequate.
- Low health satisfaction: Self-reported health satisfaction is low (score 2.67, Z ≈ -1.2). Lower satisfaction with physical health is modestly associated with greater perceived stress in the sample and may contribute to elevated stress appraisals independent of other indicators.

Features that suggest relatively lower perceived stress
- Low self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 6 (Z ≈ -0.76, classified “not depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 31 (Z ≈ -1.02, “not anxious”) both fall well below the sample mean and these scales correlate positively with PSS in the cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.28; STAI r ≈ 0.31). Low scores here argue for lower perceived stress overall.
- Higher self-esteem and favorable behavioral health habits: Rosenberg self-esteem is elevated (Z ≈ 1.1), and the participant reports regular exercise (exercised alone three times per week or more, Z ≈ 1.07) and minimal substance use. These protective psychosocial and behavioral factors are associated with lower stress and better coping capacity.
- Objective sleep quantity and regularity: Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 34 m (Z ≈ 0.47), and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is low (SD ≈ 42 minutes, Z ≈ -1.34). Although subjective sleep quality is somewhat disturbed, the combination of sufficient average sleep duration and low variability tends to buffer perceived stress.
- Lower basal physiological arousal: Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.33). In this sample, higher resting heart rate correlates modestly with higher PSS (r ≈ 0.14), so the participant’s lower resting heart rate is more consistent with lower perceived stress.

Integrated interpretation and comparative statement
Synthesizing the evidence, the strongest protective signals against high perceived stress are the low depression and trait-anxiety scores, elevated self-esteem, consistent and adequate sleep duration, regular exercise, and a relatively low resting heart rate. Counterbalancing these are objective markers of circadian fragmentation and pronounced evening heart-rate elevations plus a subjective report of disturbed sleep and low health satisfaction—features that are associated in the sample with higher PSS. Taken together, the preponderance of trait and baseline physiological indicators point to stress levels at or slightly below average for this study population, while the circadian/within-day instability and subjective sleep complaint signal risk for episodic or situational stress. Compared to the study sample mean PSS (mean = 21.62), the participant’s pattern is best characterized as near the mean, leaning slightly below the population mean.

Implications and suggested follow-up areas
- Monitor and, if desired, address evening physiological arousal and subjective sleep quality (behavioral sleep strategies, wind-down routines, or targeted assessment of evening obligations/rumination). Improving evening rhythm could reduce the circadian fragmentation signal (IV) that is positively associated with PSS.
- Leverage existing protective factors (regular exercise, low depressive/anxiety symptom burden, high self-esteem) in stress-management planning.
- If there is concern about health satisfaction or episodic stress tied to academic demands, brief targeted assessments (daily stress diaries, ecological momentary assessment) could help determine whether the elevated IV and evening HR elevations reflect acute, context-specific stressors versus a more persistent dysregulation.

Limitations
This conclusion synthesizes cross-sectional and aggregated wearable metrics and self-report collected during a semester; hourly heart-rate metrics are aggregated across days and cannot be used to infer temporal trends or causal direction."
77789,"Summary: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mixture of signals that both converge on and counter-indicate elevated perceived stress. Self-report scales indicate elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 20, z = 0.7) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, z = 0.17), and subjective sleep quality is in the disturbed range (PSQI = 6). Wearable-derived physiology shows a higher-than-average resting heart rate and mesor (RHR = 68.7 bpm, mesor = 83.2; both z ≈ +1.25) and a reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude z ≈ −0.99). At the same time, the participant shows behavioral supports for resilience (low substance use, relatively high trust and self-reported current happiness, regular day-to-day structure as indexed by interdaily stability). Taken together, these patterns suggest perceived stress at or modestly above the study mean rather than far below or far above it.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several physiological and symptom indicators align with greater perceived stress. Depressive symptom burden (CES‑D) is above the study mean (z = +0.7) and trait anxiety is slightly elevated; both of these scales correlate positively with PSS in the sample. Resting heart rate and the MESOR of heart rate are elevated (both z ≈ +1.25), which can reflect chronic physiological arousal and showed small positive correlations with PSS. Nighttime sleep is relatively short (median 6 h 32 m, z ≈ −0.8) and sleep duration is highly variable (SD ≈ 166 min, z ≈ +1.49); greater night-to-night variability is associated with higher PSS in this dataset. Subjective sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5) further supports an adverse sleep-related contribution. The circadian amplitude derived from heart rate is attenuated (amplitude z ≈ −0.99), a pattern sometimes associated with stress-related or affective dysregulation. Finally, the hourly heart-rate aggregate shows an unusually large early-morning elevation (8–9 am deviation z ≈ +1.71) that could reflect elevated morning physiological arousal (e.g., stress, caffeine, or activity) relative to peers.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Several behavioral and contextual features are protective or neutral with respect to perceived stress. The participant reports very low use of alcohol and no recreational/non-prescribed drug use, which reduces substance-related stress risk. Interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythm is relatively high (z ≈ +0.67), indicating consistent day-to-day scheduling of activity/rest—a regularity often associated with better stress resilience. Intradaily variability is not elevated (z ≈ −0.39), suggesting consolidated activity/rest patterns across the day. Self-reported trust and current happiness are above average (trust z ≈ +0.83; happiness z ≈ +0.55), and reading time is relatively high (reading z ≈ +1.3) — behaviors and attitudes that correlate with lower perceived stress in this sample. Academic performance (GPA) is high and social-risk behaviors are low, which can be protective in the academic context.

Interpretation of circadian and hourly heart-rate features: The participant’s circadian heart-rate profile is characterized by a high MESOR with a reduced amplitude and an acrophase near late afternoon (≈ 4:00 PM). A higher baseline heart-rate (MESOR/RHR) together with a blunted amplitude can indicate a generally elevated autonomic setpoint with less pronounced diurnal modulation—an axis often implicated in chronic stress or mood disturbance. At the same time, the relatively high interdaily stability suggests consistent daily scheduling (sleep/wake or activity patterns) despite the blunted amplitude. The marked morning heart-rate elevation at 8–9 am stands out as an acute daily peak relative to peers and may reflect morning activity or heightened morning arousal; this feature should be considered in light of behavioral context (commute, classes, caffeine) that is not specified here.

Holistic conclusion and comparison to the study population mean: Balancing the signals, the profile contains meaningful indicators of elevated perceived stress (elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, disturbed and variable sleep, elevated resting HR and blunted circadian amplitude) alongside protective behaviors and stable daily structure (low substance use, higher trust/happiness, high interdaily stability). Given this mixture, the most defensible inference is that the participant’s perceived stress is near the study population mean or modestly above it rather than markedly below or extremely elevated. In the context of the sample mean PSS = 21.62 (SD = 3.68), the available data support an estimate of perceived stress that is around the mean to slightly higher than average (i.e., within roughly one standard deviation above the mean). This interpretation emphasizes the coexistence of physiological and symptomatic markers that push in the direction of higher perceived stress together with several behavioral/protective factors that likely buffer overall perceived stress."
88882,"Summary: The multimodal profile shows a mix of behavioral and physiological signatures. Psychometrically, the participant reports low trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) and minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D = 2, Z = -1.18), along with elevated self-reported happiness (Z = 1.64) and above-average self-esteem (Z = 1.10). Objective wearable data indicate relatively short and late sleep (median nightly sleep 5 h 57 m, Z = -1.53; median sleep start ~02:34), a low resting heart rate (47.35 bpm, Z = -1.28), and circadian rhythm irregularity characterized by reduced interdaily stability (0.34, Z = -0.57), elevated intradaily variability (0.63, Z = 0.60), and low 24-hour autocorrelation (0.23, Z = -0.78). Taken together, subjective reports and physiological fitness markers contrast with sleep insufficiency and circadian irregularity.

Evidence consistent with relatively higher perceived stress: Several objective sleep and circadian features commonly associated with greater perceived stress are present. Median nightly sleep duration is substantially below the study mean (about 6 hours; Z = -1.53) and the PSQI score (6) classifies the participant as having disturbed sleep; both short sleep and poorer subjective sleep quality commonly co-occur with elevated stress. The participant’s sleep timing is markedly delayed (median sleep start ~02:34), and circadian summary metrics show diminished day-to-day regularity (lower interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation) together with higher intradaily fragmentation — a pattern that correlates modestly with higher PSS in this dataset (intradaily variability correlation with PSS ≈ 0.16). The hourly heart-rate deviations showing relatively large evening increases (e.g., elevated mean deviations in the 7–9 pm window) could reflect later-day physiological arousal or activity that is temporally aligned with delayed sleep onset. These sleep/circadian features are the most salient signals in the direction of greater perceived stress.

Evidence consistent with relatively lower perceived stress: Multiple trait- and behavior-based indicators point toward lower perceived stress. The participant scores low on trait anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI and CES-D both well below the sample mean), reports high happiness and self-esteem, and rates health satisfaction positively — all psychometric markers that are negatively associated with PSS or protective against stress-related perceptual burden. Objective physiology also supports lower stress: a low resting heart rate (Z = -1.28) is consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and often parallels lower chronic physiological arousal. Behavioral habits further buffer stress risk: frequent exercise (exercised alone three times a week or more, Z ≈ 1.07), minimal recreational or non-prescribed drug use, modest alcohol consumption, high academic performance (GPA near 4.0), and limited engagement in sedentary recreational behaviors are all associated with lower stress vulnerability in this sample.

Holistic inference relative to the study population mean: Balancing the evidence, the participant presents a mixed profile in which psychological trait measures and healthy lifestyle behaviors suggest lower perceived stress, while sleep insufficiency and circadian irregularity represent notable risk factors for elevated perceived stress. Given the relative magnitudes (strong negative z-scores for STAI and CES-D, positive z-scores for happiness/self-esteem and exercise, but a large negative z for sleep duration and moderate positive z for intradaily variability), the overall pattern is most consistent with a perceived stress level near or modestly below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62). In other words: the participant’s inferred PSS is likely “near the mean,” perhaps slightly below it, rather than clearly above-average.

Confidence and caveats: This inference emphasizes converging low trait-anxiety and mood symptoms and strong fitness/exercise signals, tempered by objectively short and late sleep and reduced circadian regularity. Correlations between individual wearable metrics and PSS in the dataset are modest, so wearable signals should be interpreted as risk markers rather than determinative indicators. The absence of an actual PSS self-report for this participant limits certainty; direct PSS measurement would improve classification. If concern about stress or sleep persists, targeted assessment of daily stressors and interventions to stabilize sleep timing and increase total sleep time would be the most directly relevant next steps."
19245,"Summary of salient multimodal features: The participant’s profile shows a mixture of strong self-report indicators of affective distress alongside behavioral and physiological patterns that are partly protective. Self-report instruments indicate elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 26, z = +1.32) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, z = +1.35). Subjective sleep quality is mildly disturbed (PSQI = 7), and current happiness and trust scores are well below the sample mean (happy z = -1.61; trust z = -2.07). Wearable-derived circadian features indicate relatively low interdaily stability (0.31, z = -0.82) and a flattened circadian amplitude (amplitude = 10.08, z = -0.23) with a late median sleep onset (02:38) and high night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep SD ≈ 155 minutes, z = +1.23; sleep start SD z = +0.92). Resting heart rate and mesor are lower than the sample mean (RHR = 49.6 bpm, z = -1.02; mesor = 66.4, z = -1.03), and hourly heart-rate deviations show elevated relative cardiovascular activity in late evening/early night hours (large positive deviations at 10–12pm, z’s up to +2.25).

Evidence pointing toward relatively higher perceived stress: Multiple high-loading psychological measures that typically co-occur with perceived stress are elevated—CES-D and trait anxiety are both >1 SD above the sample mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSS in this study (r ≈ 0.28–0.31). Subjective reports of low happiness, low trust in others, and below-average health satisfaction further align with higher stress. Sleep patterns consistent with stress are present: clinically meaningful PSQI score (>5), very late median sleep onset (02:38) combined with large variability in sleep onset and duration (both z ≈ +1.0–1.2) and increased daytime napping (mean daily naps z = +2.27). Wearable circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability and reduced amplitude, indicating a less-structured day-to-day rhythm—an irregular schedule that is commonly associated with elevated perceived stress. Elevated heart-rate deviations in late evening/early night suggest greater physiological activation during hours typically reserved for winding down, consistent with longer sleep latency or nocturnal arousal. Taken together, these affective, sleep, rhythm, and physiological markers point toward greater perceived stress.

Evidence pointing toward relatively lower perceived stress (protective features): The participant shows several indicators that can mitigate perceived stress. Objective sleep duration is longer than the sample mean (median 8 h 6 min, z = +1.14), which may provide restorative benefit despite timing irregularities. Resting heart rate and mesor are both substantially below the sample mean (z ≈ -1.0), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness—an attribute associated with reduced stress reactivity. The participant reports regular exercise (exercised alone three times per week or more, z = +1.07) and maintains above-average social time and leisure (listening to music and socializing z’s ≈ +0.95 to +1.13), both of which are potential buffers against stress. Academic performance (high GPAs across terms) also suggests functioning that may offset some stress-related impairment. These features mitigate, but do not eliminate, the impact of the elevated affective symptoms and sleep/rhythm disturbances described above.

Holistic interpretation relative to the study sample mean PSS: Balancing the evidence, the profile contains several high-weight indicators of elevated perceived stress (notably clinically elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, disturbed subjective sleep, late and irregular sleep timing, and reduced circadian stability), alongside protective factors (long objective sleep duration, low resting heart rate, regular exercise, social/leisure activities, and strong academic performance). Overall, the preponderance of indicators that typically covary with higher PSS suggests that this participant’s perceived stress is likely above the sample mean (population mean PSS = 21.6, SD = 3.67). Given the magnitude of the affective measures (both >1 SD above the mean) and the corroborating circadian/sleep irregularities, a conservative inference is that the participant’s perceived stress would fall at least modestly above the mean—plausibly between the sample median and the upper quartile—rather than near or below the population average. This conclusion is probabilistic and based on patterns of correlated measures rather than a direct PSS score; discrepancies can exist at the individual level, so direct PSS measurement would be needed for confirmation."
83748,"Summary overview: The participant’s multimodal profile shows a mix of protective psychosocial markers and a few physiological/behavioral signals that plausibly reflect episodic or circadian-linked arousal. Self-report trait measures (CES-D = 9, STAI-Trait = 24) are well below the study mean and population distributions (Z-scores −0.45 and −1.71 respectively), and state indicators of positive well‑being (Rosenberg self‑esteem Z = +1.52; momentary “Happy” Z = +1.64) and high health satisfaction (Z = +0.72) point toward comparatively low perceived distress. On the other hand, sleep and wearable-derived circadian features show modest departures from the sample that could reflect physiological stress-related patterns: the PSQI indicates disturbed sleep (score = 6), median nightly sleep is somewhat shorter than sample average (~6 h 54 m, Z = −0.35), interdaily stability of heart‑rate rhythms is below average (0.37, Z = −0.33) and autocorrelation at 24 h is low (0.22, Z = −0.87), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.56, Z = +0.10). These mixed sources of evidence point to generally low self‑reported psychological symptom burden but some wearables-derived signatures of circadian irregularity and evening physiological activation.

Features that support a relatively lower perceived stress level: multiple self‑report indicators that typically track inversely with perceived stress are substantially favorable. Depressive symptom burden (CES‑D) and trait anxiety (STAI‑T) are both below sample means and well below clinical concerns; self‑esteem and momentary happiness are both markedly above average, which is associated with resilience and lower perceived stress (self‑esteem correlation with PSS = −0.15). The participant reports frequent exercise (three times per week or more for individual and group exercise and sports; Z-scores > +1), minimal substance use, no recreational/non‑prescribed drugs, and good health satisfaction — behavioral factors commonly linked to lower perceived stress. Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.3 bpm, Z = −0.34), and sleep start time is consistent across nights (sleep start SD Z = −0.93) with no daytime napping; these physiological and behavioral stability markers are also typically protective.

Features that support a relatively higher perceived stress level: some objective signals are consistent with circadian irregularity or evening physiological arousal, which have been associated with higher perceived stress in previous work. The PSQI score exceeds the common cutoff for disturbed sleep (6), indicating subjective sleep difficulty despite objectively stable bedtimes. Wearable circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability and low 24‑hour autocorrelation, suggesting weaker day‑to‑day regularity of heart‑rate rhythms. Hourly aggregate heart‑rate deviations reveal pronounced evening peaks (notably 5–7 pm: +22 to +28 bpm above the mesor; Z-scores up to +2.67) and an unusually large elevation late at night / around midnight (11–12am shown as +26.98, Z = +3.51), which indicate periods of elevated physiological arousal during times when HR would more typically be closer to baseline. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (Z ≈ +0.10), and some of the early‑morning heart‑rate troughs and evening elevations show small positive correlations with PSS in the sample (hourly correlations up to ~0.21), consistent with a pattern of circadian or evening arousal that can co‑occur with higher perceived stress. Low socializing time (15 minutes or less; Z = −2.20) is another behavioral factor that can contribute to vulnerability for elevated perceived stress, though its direct correlation with PSS in this sample is small.

Synthesis and overall comparison to the study population mean PSS: weighing the evidence, the strongest and most consistent signals in this participant’s profile are protective—low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self‑esteem and happiness, frequent exercise, low substance use, and favorable health satisfaction—each of which tends to associate with lower perceived stress and together provide robust support for a relatively low PSS. The wearable indications of circadian irregularity and pronounced evening/late‑night heart‑rate elevations are notable and may reflect episodes of physiological activation or sleep‑related disturbance that could elevate perceived stress for this person; however, those wearable signals are of smaller magnitude in their correlations with PSS in the study sample and contrast with the participant’s low symptom and high well‑being profile. On balance, the multimodal evidence most consistently supports a perceived stress level at or slightly below the study population mean rather than above it. Stated explicitly: the participant’s inferred overall perceived stress level is below the population mean PSS (population mean = 21.62), albeit not drastically lower, and wearable‑derived circadian/arousal patterns suggest areas to monitor (sleep quality and evening physiological activation).

Caveats: this inference integrates cross‑sectional survey items and epoch‑aggregated wearable summaries; it does not replace direct PSS measurement and is limited by small-to-moderate correlations between individual features and PSS in the sample. The evening heart‑rate peaks and PSQI score identify plausible targets for follow‑up (e.g., detailed sleep diaries, evening activity and stressor assessment) if reducing perceived stress or improving sleep physiology is an objective."
63347,"Summary
Across self-report and wearable-derived measures, the participant presents a mixed profile of risk and protective features for perceived stress. Trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) and subjectively disturbed sleep (PSQI = 7) are the most salient survey-based indicators that tend to align with higher perceived stress. In contrast, multiple wearable-derived circadian metrics show relatively high rhythm strength and regularity (e.g., amplitude Z = 1.69; autocorrelation at 24 h Z = 0.98; interdaily stability Z = 0.58), which are patterns that have been associated with lower perceived stress in the study sample. Behavioral habits (low substance use, high academic performance) and positive self-evaluations (Rosenberg self-esteem = 40, Z = 0.26; current happiness = 4, Z = 0.55) further offset some stress-related indicators. Considering the balance of evidence, the participant’s overall inferred perceived stress level is near the study sample mean PSS (population mean = 21.62), with some signals suggesting a modest elevation relative to that mean.

Features suggesting relatively higher perceived stress
- Elevated trait anxiety: The STAI–Trait score of 45 (Z = 0.37) is above the sample mean and is positively associated with PSS in the dataset (score correlation ~0.31). Trait anxiety is a robust predictor of higher perceived stress and therefore points toward greater stress burden.  
- Subjective sleep disturbance and irregular sleep: The PSQI score of 7 (classified as “Disturbed Sleep”) indicates clinically meaningful sleep complaints and is commonly linked to elevated perceived stress. Nightly wearable data show a late median sleep onset (01:28) and a moderately reduced median sleep duration (6 h 49 min, Z = -0.46), while sleep-duration variability is relatively high (SD = 151 minutes, Z = 1.14). Greater night-to-night variability in sleep and later bedtimes are both features that tend to co-occur with higher PSS (sleep variability here correlates positively with PSS ~0.14).  
- Low engagement in physical and social activities: Self-report indicates minimal exercise (exercised alone and with others: “Not at all”, Zs ≈ -1.9 and -1.6) and limited time socializing (16–30 minutes, Z = -1.41). Reduced physical activity and social contact are commonly associated with higher perceived stress or reduced stress-buffering capacity.  
- Some physiological indicators compatible with stress reactivity: Several early-morning hourly heart-rate deviations show large negative departures from mesor (e.g., 3–7 AM ~ -25 bpm, Zs ≈ -1.0 to -1.35), and the resting heart rate is moderate. While these nocturnal drops reflect sleep physiology, their association with sleep timing/quality and the participant’s subjective sleep disturbance could reflect a physiological milieu that supports elevated subjective stress for this individual.

Features suggesting relatively lower perceived stress
- Strong circadian organization in heart rate: Parametric and non-parametric circadian metrics are comparatively high — amplitude (Z = 1.69), autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 0.98), and interdaily stability (Z = 0.58). In this sample these features correlate negatively with PSS (e.g., amplitude and autocorrelation correlations ≈ -0.17), which suggests that regular, high-amplitude daily rhythms are a protective factor against perceived stress for this participant.  
- Low intradaily variability and periodic structure: Intradaily variability is relatively low (value = 0.35, Z = -1.38), indicating fewer abrupt shifts within days, a pattern that has been linked to better regulation and lower PSS in other work. The participant’s aggregate hourly heart-rate pattern also shows pronounced, consistent evening elevations (e.g., 7–9 PM large positive deviations, Z up to 2.29), which can reflect consistent daily activities or social/evening routines that provide behavioral structure.  
- Positive self-evaluations and adaptive behaviors: Self-esteem (Rosenberg = 40) and current happiness (4.0) are above the sample mean and show inverse associations with PSS in the study. Low substance use and strong academic performance (GPA ~3.9) are additional indices of stable habits and functioning that tend to accompany lower perceived stress or greater resilience.  
- Relatively low resting heart rate: The participant’s resting HR (56.9 bpm, Z = -0.15) is slightly below sample average; lower resting HR can reflect higher cardiovascular fitness or lower tonic sympathetic activation and is not strongly associated with higher PSS in this dataset.

Holistic interpretation and comparison to the study sample mean
When integrating survey and wearable signals, the profile is mixed: survey self-report (particularly trait anxiety and disturbed subjective sleep) points toward elevated perceived stress, while robust, regular circadian physiology, adaptive daytime structure, positive self-evaluations, and low substance use argue for lower perceived stress. Given the magnitude of these opposing signals and the observed correlations in the sample, the overall balance supports an inferred perceived stress level that is near the study population mean PSS (mean = 21.62, SD = 3.68), with a modest tendency toward being slightly above the mean driven primarily by elevated trait anxiety and subjective sleep disturbance. In other words, this participant’s pattern is best characterized as close to typical for the cohort, with identifiable targets (sleep timing/variability and physical/social activity) that, if improved, could plausibly shift their perceived stress downward.

Implications for monitoring or intervention (brief)
Monitoring objective sleep regularity and targeting evening/midnight sleep timing and sleep variability, along with modest increases in routine physical activity or social engagement, are empirically concordant targets given this profile. Reducing trait anxiety tendencies may require longer-term psychosocial approaches (e.g., cognitive-behavioral strategies), while maintaining strong circadian regularity should be treated as a protective resource in follow-up."
