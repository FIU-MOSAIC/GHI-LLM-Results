44869,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological profile: The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 22, Z = 0.9), which is a salient signal relative to the study population and is one of the survey measures most strongly correlated with PSQI in this dataset (r = 0.49). Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI = 39, Z = -0.23), and self-esteem is at the scale maximum (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26), suggesting a mixed psychological picture in which depressive symptom frequency is higher than average but global trait anxiety and self-worth are not. Subjective well-being items (e.g., current happiness Z = -0.53) are modestly below average, while health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.55). These patterns indicate notable affective symptoms that can influence perceived sleep quality and daytime functioning even in the context of otherwise positive self-evaluations.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: The participant reports minimal substance use and no daytime napping, but also very low frequency of exercise (exercised alone 1–2×/month; exercised with others and sports “not at all”) and extensive sedentary leisure time (sedentary hobby >4 hours, Z = 3.19; TV/videos 2–3 hours, Z = 1.91). High evening/ leisure screen and media exposure are likely (internet, listening to music each 2–3 hours; watching TV high). These behavioral features—low physical activity and high sedentary/evening media engagement—are plausibly linked to rhythm irregularity and sleep timing, and are consistent with known behavioral contributors to poorer sleep consolidation and subjective sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived physiology and circadian metrics: The participant’s heart-rate profile shows elevated baseline cardiovascular activation relative to peers (Resting HR = 78.4 bpm, Z = 2.41; Mesor = 88.34, Z = 1.97). Amplitude of the circadian heart-rate rhythm is reduced (Amplitude Z = -0.91) while interdaily stability is near average (Z = 0.17) and intradaily variability is higher than typical (Z = 1.16). The hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM), but because the mesor and resting HR are high and amplitude is blunted, the physiological day–night contrast is attenuated. Together these features indicate elevated tonic physiological arousal and a less robust circadian amplitude, with some fragmentation of activity across the day—patterns that are commonly associated with poorer sleep quality and increased sleep complaints.

Objective sleep timing and variability: Fitbit-derived sleep shows a long median nightly duration (8 h 26 min, Z = 1.55) and a late typical sleep start (median start ≈ 01:00). Critically, sleep is highly variable across nights: sleep duration SD ≈ 193 minutes (Z = 2.09) and sleep start time SD ≈ 157 minutes (Z = 1.63). These elevated variability indicators—large night-to-night fluctuations in both duration and timing—are behaviorally important and correlate positively with PSQI in this dataset (duration SD r ≈ 0.19; start-time SD r ≈ 0.17). The pattern of relatively long average sleep duration combined with late and irregular timing suggests either inconsistent schedules (e.g., delayed/shifted sleep on some nights with compensatory long sleep on others) or frequent sleep extension, both of which can degrade subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning despite high mean duration.

Integrated interpretation and PSQI ranking: Synthesizing self-report, behavioral, and wearable data, the most salient indicators pointing toward poorer sleep quality are: elevated depressive symptoms with a strong correlation to PSQI, markedly elevated night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration (high Z-scores), elevated resting heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude (suggesting higher physiological arousal and blunted day–night differentiation), and behavioral patterns of low physical activity and high sedentary/evening media use. The single features that might argue against poor sleep are long median sleep duration and absence of naps; however, the very high variability in timing and duration combined with psychological and physiological markers that are linked to worse PSQI make it more likely that the participant experiences subjective sleep difficulties. On balance, the evidence supports the participant having a PSQI score in the worse half of the study distribution.

92552,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Sleep timing and duration
The wearable sleep statistics indicate that this participant typically obtains a relatively long nightly sleep bout (median 7 h 49 min; Z = 0.79), but the timing of that sleep is markedly delayed and variable. The median sleep start time is very late (around 03:48), and the standard deviation of sleep duration is high (174 minutes; Z = 1.66), indicating large night-to-night variability in total sleep time. Sleep start time also shows moderate variability (SD ≈ 94 minutes; Z = 0.25). The participant reports some daytime napping (mean daily naps 0.22; Z = 1.75), suggesting occasional compensation for nocturnal timing or sleep loss. Taken together, these features describe a schedule in which sleep is often consolidated but shifted late into the morning and inconsistently timed across days, a pattern that increases the likelihood of subjective sleep complaints even when average duration appears adequate.

Physiological and circadian profile
Cardiovascular measures show a low overall mesor and low resting heart rate (Mesor = 63 bpm, Z = -1.49; Resting HR = 48.8 bpm, Z = -1.11), consistent with relatively high cardiovascular fitness or low baseline arousal. Circadian regularity metrics, however, suggest reduced day-to-day rhythm stability and greater fragmentation: interdaily stability is mildly low (0.38; Z = -0.24) while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.59; Z = 0.32). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations relative to the mesor show elevated values in late evening and around midnight–early morning (notably large positive deviations at 12–3am, with particularly high Z-scores at 1–3am), followed by strong negative deviations across the typical morning hours (4–11am). The cosinor acrophase occurs in the evening (≈ 8:48 PM), and amplitude is near the cohort mean. This pattern is consistent with a shifted activity/arousal profile in which the participant’s physiological activity remains elevated in late evening and early night, then declines markedly during the late morning—aligning with the observed late sleep onset and later wake time. The combination of reduced interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability indicates less consistent daily structure, which commonly relates to subjective sleep disturbances.

Psychological traits and behaviors relevant to sleep
Self-report measures indicate modest elevations in trait anxiety (STAI = 45; Z = 0.37) and subthreshold depressive symptom frequency (CES-D = 15; Z = 0.18), though clinical classifications provided label the CES-D score as not depressed. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are above average (self-esteem Z = 0.82; happiness Z = 0.55), while health satisfaction is lower than average (Z = -0.78). Lifestyle behaviors include weekly alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0) and relatively infrequent structured exercise. Several of these psychosocial variables (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms, low health satisfaction) have nontrivial positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample, indicating that when they are elevated they tend to co-occur with poorer subjective sleep quality. The participant’s moderate anxiety, occasional alcohol use in the evening, and low health satisfaction are therefore consistent with potential contributors to worse perceived sleep.

Integration and implications for sleep quality
Putting the multimodal evidence together: objective sleep duration is generally adequate, but the very late and irregular sleep schedule, elevated night-time cardiovascular deviations around midnight–early morning, reduced circadian stability, and modest elevations in trait anxiety/affective symptoms collectively point toward disrupted sleep organization and pre-sleep or late-evening physiological arousal. These features—particularly irregular timing and pre-sleep arousal—are well-established contributors to poorer subjective sleep quality and higher PSQI scores, even when total sleep time is not reduced. Protective indicators (long median sleep, low resting HR, higher-than-average self-esteem and happiness) moderate risk somewhat, but they do not fully offset the pattern of irregular timing and physiological arousal. Correlations in the study sample between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and PSQI further support the likelihood that the participant’s psychological profile and irregular behavior are associated with worse subjective sleep.

Overall PSQI group assessment
Considering the balance of evidence—late and inconsistent sleep timing, physiological signs of evening/early-night arousal, reduced circadian regularity, and modest anxiety/affective symptoms—I judge that this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of PSQI scores (i.e., worse sleep quality) relative to the study population distribution.

73158,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant’s self-report measures consistently indicate low affective burden and favorable psychosocial functioning. Depressive symptomatology on the CES-D is at the floor (score = 0; Z = -1.38) and trait anxiety is low (STAI = 24; Z = -1.71). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (RSES Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64) and perceived stress is below the sample mean (Z = -0.71). Health satisfaction is above average, and reports of substance use are uniformly minimal. These survey indicators typically associate with lower subjective sleep complaints and reduced likelihood of the cognitive–emotional processes (rumination, worry) that commonly worsen self-reported sleep quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signals: Heart-rate–based circadian measures point to a well-defined daily rhythm and generally low physiological arousal at rest. The participant’s resting heart rate is low (48.2 bpm; Z = -1.18) and cosinor amplitude is near average with an acrophase around early afternoon (1:01 PM), consistent with a normative daytime peak. Aggregated hourly deviations show a pronounced nocturnal dip in heart rate (large negative deviations from mesor between ~12–4 AM) and a strong morning rise (notable positive deviations 5–8 AM); these patterns indicate consolidated nocturnal quiescence and a clear circadian transition into daytime activity. Nonparametric rhythm metrics are not extreme: intradaily variability is below average (Z = -0.74), suggesting relatively low fragmentation of the heart rate signal across the day, while interdaily stability is around the sample mean (Z = -0.16), indicating only modest day-to-day regularity differences compared with peers.

Objective sleep behaviors from the wearable: The Fitbit-derived sleep summary shows a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 11 minutes (Z = -1.25), indicating shorter sleep than the study average. Night-to-night variability in duration is substantial (SD ≈ 105 minutes), and sleep start times cluster around 23:35 with moderate variability (SD ≈ 67 minutes). Napping is absent. In sum, the dominant objective concern is reduced total sleep time coupled with appreciable variability across nights; sleep timing is moderately late but within a common student schedule.

Synthesis and implication for sleep quality (PSQI): The combined evidence presents a mixed but overall favorable profile for perceived sleep quality. Psychologically, factors that most strongly predict self-reported sleep problems (depressive symptoms and anxiety) are minimal in this participant, and high self-esteem and happiness further bias toward better subjective sleep. Physiologically, the device-derived signals (pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline, low intradaily variability, low resting HR) are consistent with consolidated and restorative nocturnal physiology. Counterbalancing these positives is objectively short median sleep duration (~6.2 hours) and elevated night-to-night variability in sleep length; both can contribute to poorer sleep-related functioning and subjective complaints captured by PSQI domains (duration, daytime dysfunction). Given the relative strengths of the psychological and physiological indicators (which have strong links to subjective sleep quality in this dataset) and the fact that the primary objective deficit is shorter sleep—rather than fragmented nocturnal physiology or substantial circadian disruption—I judge the overall pattern to be more consistent with average-to-good sleep quality in this sample rather than markedly poor sleep.

45963,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports elevated affective symptoms. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D is 22 (Z = 0.9) and the trait anxiety score (STAI) is 62 (Z = 2.05), both of which are positively correlated with poorer PSQI in this sample (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40). Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 30, Z = -1.15, r = -0.35) and momentary happiness is low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61), while perceived stress is modestly elevated (score = 24, Z = 0.65). These convergent self-report indicators point toward higher internalizing symptoms and lower subjective well-being, which in this dataset are associated with worse sleep quality.

Sleep timing and behavior (wearable + self-report): Wearable-derived sleep summaries show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 40 minutes (Z = -0.64), which is slightly below the study average but not extremely so. Night-to-night variability in sleep timing is prominent: median sleep start is late (about 01:56) with a large standard deviation of sleep start times (SD = 215 minutes, Z = 2.89), indicating frequent large shifts in when sleep begins. Nightly sleep duration variability is also elevated (SD = 115 minutes, Z = 0.32). Napping is negligible (mean daily naps 0.08). The combination of late average sleep onset and large variability in sleep timing is a behavioral pattern commonly linked to subjective sleep disturbance and circadian misalignment, and the sleep timing variability shows a modest positive correlation with PSQI (r = 0.18).

Circadian and physiological profile from wearable data: Heart rate–based circadian metrics indicate a relatively blunted and irregular rhythm. Interdaily stability is low (0.16, Z = -2.06), and cosinor amplitude is reduced (4.2, Z = -2.13), both suggesting weak day-to-day regularity and a low-amplitude circadian signal in heart rate. Mesor is somewhat elevated (81.8 bpm, Z = 1.07) and resting heart rate is higher than average (68.2 bpm, Z = 1.2), patterns that can reflect higher physiological arousal or lower cardiovascular fitness; resting heart rate shows a small positive correlation with PSQI (r = 0.12). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show modestly elevated heart rate late at night/around midnight (e.g., 12–1am +5.9 bpm, 1–2am +3.8 bpm) and pronounced negative deviations overnight (e.g., 4–7am down 11–14 bpm), consistent with periods of nocturnal reduction in rate but with some nocturnal elevation around sleep onset. Overall these circadian and heart rate features indicate a low-amplitude, poorly stabilized rhythm with modest signs of elevated nocturnal arousal and higher baseline cardiovascular tone.

Integration and inference about sleep quality: Several convergent signals point toward relatively poorer sleep quality. The strongest indicators are elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms (STAI and CES-D), late and highly variable sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:56, sleep-start SD Z = 2.89), and markedly reduced interdaily stability and amplitude of circadian heart-rate rhythms (Zs ≈ -2.1). These features have known associations with worse subjective sleep and show positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (notably CES-D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40). Some metrics are only mildly adverse (median sleep duration slightly below average, little napping, moderate duration variability), and the participant does not report heavy recreational drug use; however, the combination of affective symptoms and clear circadian irregularity weighs toward poorer global sleep quality. On balance, the multimodal evidence supports that this participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep quality).

22138,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Objective wearable-derived metrics indicate generally preserved sleep quantity and reasonably stable circadian physiology across the recording period. Median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 32 minutes (z = 0.43), with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 82 minutes, z = -0.43) and virtually no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0, z = -0.86). Heart-rate–based circadian features show a robust diurnal pattern (amplitude z = 0.73) and modestly elevated interdaily stability (0.47, z = 0.50) alongside low intradaily fragmentation (intradaily variability z = -0.53). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations are strongly negative overnight (largest reductions between ~2–4 AM) and show pronounced daytime elevations (largest deviations mid-afternoon and early evening), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and distinct daytime activity periods. Taken together, these wearable indicators point to adequate objective sleep duration, consolidated nighttime physiology, and a reasonably structured rest–activity rhythm.

Self-report and behavioral measures identify several factors that could shape subjective sleep experience. The participant reports a late typical sleep start time (median ~1:15 AM) with above-average variability in sleep onset timing (start-time SD z = 0.83), substantive weekly alcohol consumption of liquor/wine (1–2 times per week; z = 0.94), and moderate evening screen/media use (watching TV/videos 1–2 hours; internet use 2–3 hours). Psychological trait scores show elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50, z = 0.86) and higher perceived stress (score z = 0.65), while depressive symptoms are in a low-to-moderate range (CES-D = 15, z = 0.18). These survey-derived features include several constructs (anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, inconsistent sleep timing, alcohol use) that are positively associated with poorer subjective sleep in the study population and therefore increase the likelihood of sleep complaints even when objective sleep quantity appears adequate.

Balancing objective and subjective indicators, the dominant wearable-derived pattern suggests relatively preserved physiological sleep quality (sufficient duration, low fragmentation, structured circadian amplitude), which are typically associated with lower PSQI (better sleep). Countervailing evidence for worse PSQI comes from late and variable bedtimes, elevated trait anxiety and stress, and weekly alcohol use—factors that tend to drive worse subjective sleep quality and higher PSQI scores. Correlational signals in the dataset (notably CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI) indicate that the participant’s elevated anxiety and modest depressive symptomatology are relevant risk markers for higher PSQI, but their effect must be weighed against objectively favorable sleep measures.

Overall assessment: the wearable and sleep-duration indicators provide stronger and multiple objective signals of consolidated sleep and regular circadian structure, while the self-report psychological and lifestyle factors introduce moderate risk for subjective sleep disturbance. On balance, the evidence favors placement in the lower half of the study’s PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good/average sleep quality compared with peers), because objective sleep quantity and circadian regularity are overall supportive and the subjective risk factors are present but not extreme. Therefore the most likely grouping for this participant’s PSQI is bottom_50.

Reported stress is moderately above the sample mean (Z = 0.38), while momentary happiness and health-satisfaction are below average (happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.45). Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11) and academic performance is strong (GPA in the mid-3.4–3.7 range). Social trust is lower than peers (Z = -1.42). Together, these data describe a profile with internalizing symptoms and elevated stressors that commonly correlate with poorer sleep, despite intact self-regard and academic functioning.

Behavioral sleep-related habits: Fitbit-derived sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 41 minutes (Z = -0.61), indicating somewhat shorter sleep than the study average, with a nontrivial night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 110 minutes, Z = 0.22). Typical sleep onset is late (median start ~00:39) with moderate variability in bedtimes (SD ≈ 67 minutes). Napping is minimal. Daily routines include moderate weekly alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week), low-to-moderate physical activity (exercise 1–2 times per week), and above-average time spent watching TV/videos. These habits (late bedtimes, shorter aggregated sleep, variable sleep duration, evening screen time and alcohol) are consistent with behavioral contributors to diminished perceived sleep quality in student samples.

Wearable physiological and circadian indicators: Circadian regularity metrics indicate modestly stable day-to-day structure (interdaily stability = 0.44, Z = 0.25) and low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.37, Z = -1.24), which are features typically associated with more consolidated rest–activity rhythms. However, resting heart rate and mesor are substantially elevated relative to peers (resting HR = 78.2 bpm, mesor ≈ 91.4; both Z ≈ 2.38), while rhythm amplitude is slightly reduced (Z ≈ -0.5). Hourly aggregated heart rate deviations show the expected nocturnal drop (largest negative deviations ∼2–5 AM) and daytime elevations in the late morning and afternoon; the acrophase occurs in the mid-to-late afternoon (~4:05 PM). Elevated resting/midline heart rate combined with somewhat blunted amplitude can reflect increased physiological arousal or cardiorespiratory load despite a generally regular circadian pattern.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): Several features point toward relatively poorer sleep quality: elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (which correlate positively with PSQI in this sample, r ≈ 0.49 and 0.40 respectively), somewhat shorter median sleep duration and late sleep timing, and moderate night-to-night variability in sleep duration and onset (both correlated modestly with higher PSQI). Physiological data show elevated resting heart rate and mesor—small positive correlations with PSQI—suggesting greater baseline physiological arousal that can disrupt restorative sleep. Countervailing evidence includes low intradaily variability (indicating consolidated daily rhythm) and minimal napping, which are generally favorable for sleep. Overall, the weight of behavioral, affective, and physiological indicators—especially the moderate depressive/anxiety symptom burden combined with shorter, later, and somewhat variable sleep—aligns more closely with the pattern associated with higher PSQI scores in this population.

Conclusion (PSQI group): Considering the balance of evidence and the relative magnitudes of the associations with PSQI within the study sample, the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep quality) than the bottom half.

46558,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological profile and self-reported affect: The participant reports a modestly elevated level of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 17, Z = 0.38) while reporting relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43) and above-average current happiness (self-rated 5.0, Z = 1.64). Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 35, Z = -0.45) and perceived health satisfaction is above the sample mean (5.33, Z = 0.8). Reported stress is near the sample average (22, Z = 0.1). These data indicate a mixed affective profile: there is evidence of elevated depressive symptoms that are potentially relevant to subjective sleep complaints (the CES-D score shows a moderate-to-strong positive correlation with PSQI, r ≈ 0.5), but other indicators (low trait anxiety, high happiness and self-esteem) suggest the participant is not broadly characterized by high chronic anxiety or global low well‑being.

Behavioral habits relevant to sleep: The participant engages in minimal alcohol or drug use but reports very low levels of physical activity (exercise frequency Z-scores roughly between -1.1 and -1.6) and elevated sedentary recreational screen time (video games 2–3 hours daily, Z = 3.23; other sedentary hobbies Z ≈ 2.0). Socializing and internet use are modestly above the mean. Low exercise and high evening screen-based recreation are behavioral patterns that commonly co-occur with later bedtimes and may influence subjective sleep quality and sleep latency, although their direct correlations with PSQI in this dataset are small-to-moderate.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: Objective sleep metrics indicate generally favorable and regular sleep timing and duration. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 5 minutes (Z = -0.12), with low night-to-night variability (SD = 58 minutes, Z = -0.98). Napping is absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). The median sleep start time is late (about 01:14 AM) but consistent across nights (sleep start SD ≈ 55 minutes, Z = -0.61). Cardiovascular circadian markers show a coherent rhythm: interdaily stability is moderate-to-high (0.51, Z = 0.83), intradaily variability is modest (0.59, Z = 0.32), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is positive (0.41, Z = 0.73), indicating regular day-to-day structure in heart-rate patterns. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected substantial nocturnal decline (~-12 to -17 bpm across 2–6 AM) and an evening peak with higher than average deviations (notably 7–8 PM). Resting heart rate (60.7 bpm, Z = 0.3) and mean mesor (73.25, Z = -0.09) are near sample averages. Together these signals are consistent with physiologically consolidated sleep windows and intact circadian timing despite a late habitual bedtime.

Integration and interpretation for sleep quality (PSQI): Objective wearable data—adequate median sleep duration near seven hours, low night-to-night variability, lack of daytime napping, and coherent circadian structure—are most consistent with average-to-good sleep quantity and physiological consolidation of sleep. Against this, the participant’s late habitual sleep onset (≈1:15 AM) and elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D) are risk factors for poorer subjective sleep quality; CES-D shows a relatively strong positive correlation with PSQI in the sample, implying depressive symptom burden often accompanies worse self-reported sleep. Behavioral patterns of low physical activity and high evening screen time could also contribute to later bedtimes or subjective sleep complaints. Balancing the evidence, objective markers that directly index sleep duration, regularity, and nocturnal physiological dipping are reasonably favorable and the participant lacks marked physiological circadian disruption. The depressive symptom signal increases the likelihood of some subjective difficulties, but on net the multimodal profile leans toward overall sleep quality being in the lower half of the study’s PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep rather than among the worst sleepers).

Self-esteem and momentary happiness are slightly below sample means (RSES Z = -0.45; Happiness Z = -0.53). Health satisfaction is lower than average (Z = -1.11) and body mass index is in the overweight range (BMI = 28.7). Recreational substance use is minimal and group exercise occurs at a moderate frequency (1–2 times/week), but overall solitary exercise and sports participation are low. The participant has high daily internet use (>4 hours, Z = 2.19) and above-average time watching TV/videos (Z = 1.28), which indicate relatively elevated evening/at-home sedentary media exposure.

Circadian and physiological summary: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a well-structured, regular daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.51, Z = 0.83) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z = 0.81), consistent with consistent timing of daily behaviors across days. Mesor and resting heart rate are higher than sample means (Mesor = 79.4, Z = 0.74; Resting HR = 64.8, Z = 0.79), while amplitude is near average. Hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations between ~12:00–7:00 AM) and daytime elevations peaking in the early afternoon, with an acrophase at ~4:00 PM. These patterns suggest intact day–night separation of physiological arousal and a stable circadian structure across the recording period.

Sleep timing and duration characteristics: Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a median sleep onset near 00:59 (≈1:00 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 89 min, Z = 0.14) and total sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 51 minutes (Z = -0.42). Sleep duration variability (SD = 108 minutes, Z = 0.16) is slightly above average but not extreme, and mean daily naps were effectively absent (0, Z = -0.86). Taken together, the participant typically initiates sleep around midnight–1:00 AM, obtains just under 7 hours on median nights, and maintains generally consistent day-to-day timing, without compensatory napping.

Integration and likely impact on sleep quality (PSQI-relevant considerations): Several features predict relatively favorable global sleep quality: strong interdaily stability and a clear circadian rhythm (both associated with better sleep regularity), the absence of daytime naps, and low self-reported stress and depressive symptom burden. Contra-indicators are a habitual bedtime near 1:00 AM, modestly insufficient median sleep duration (slightly below 7 hours), elevated internet/media use (which can impair sleep onset or sleep quality), modest trait anxiety (which correlates with worse PSQI in the sample), and elevated resting HR / BMI (physiological factors that can relate to sleep complaints). Correlations provided with PSQI show moderate associations for depressive symptoms and anxiety (CES-D r ≈ 0.5; STAI r ≈ 0.4), but the participant’s CES-D is low and STAI only modestly elevated. Circadian stability metrics that tend to relate to better PSQI are relatively favorable for this individual (interdaily stability Z = 0.83).

Overall PSQI group assessment: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows more indicators consistent with average-to-better sleep quality (stable circadian rhythm, low stress and depressive symptoms, no naps) than with pronounced sleep disturbance. The modestly late sleep timing and slightly short median duration, plus elevated media use and some trait anxiety, could produce some PSQI component elevations but do not outweigh the favorable circadian regularity and low affective burden. On balance, the participant is more consistent with a PSQI score in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., not among the worst sleepers).

The participant reports low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 6; Z = -0.76) and generally favorable well-being indicators: above-average self-reported happiness (Z = 0.55) and high satisfaction with physical health (Z = 0.55). Trait anxiety is modestly elevated relative to the sample (STAI = 44; Z = 0.27), a feature that typically relates to poorer subjective sleep in this cohort (STAI—PSQI correlation ≈ 0.40). The participant is physically active: frequent team/partner exercise and sports (both ~three times/week or more; Z-scores 1.23 and 1.58), minimal substance use, and no regular napping. Taken together, the survey profile indicates a mostly healthy lifestyle with some anxiety-proneness that could modestly influence sleep perception.

Objective sleep and self-report sleep behavior:
Wearable-recorded sleep shows robust nightly duration: median sleep duration is 8 hours 28 minutes (Z = 1.59), well above the study mean. Sleep timing centers near midnight (median start ≈ 00:03) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 82 minutes; Z ≈ -0.02) and sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 84 min; Z ≈ -0.38). The participant does not habitually nap (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). These objective metrics—long median sleep, few naps, and generally consistent timing—would usually be expected to correspond with relatively good sleep quantity and recovery.

Physiological circadian and heart-rate patterns:
Cardiac markers reflect a low-resting cardiovascular profile (resting HR = 51.4 bpm; Z = -0.80; mesor = 63.1; Z = -1.48), suggesting good baseline cardiovascular fitness or parasympathetic tone. Circadian summary features show reduced interdaily stability (0.35; Z ≈ -0.49) and elevated intradaily variability (0.69; Z ≈ 1.02). This combination indicates that, across days, the participant’s heart rate rhythm is somewhat irregular between days and shows relatively high within-day fragmentation—patterns that can be associated with inconsistent activity or sleep fragmentation even when total sleep time is long. Hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate (~-10 to -17 bpm through the night) and daytime peaks in the afternoon/evening (notably an elevated 8–9 pm deviation, Z = 2.19), consistent with periods of higher evening arousal or activity for this individual.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality:
Objective evidence points to abundant sleep opportunity and favorable recovery physiology (long median sleep, low resting HR, regular bedtime near midnight, no naps). Behavioral context—frequent exercise, low substance use, and good health satisfaction—also supports better sleep. Countervailing signals include modestly elevated trait anxiety and circadian rhythm indicators of inter-day irregularity and intra-day fragmentation (higher intradaily variability), which can degrade subjective sleep quality or produce non-restorative sleep despite long total sleep time. Correlations in the dataset suggest anxiety and rhythm irregularity are modest contributors to worse PSQI, but the participant’s strong objective sleep quantity, active lifestyle, and low depressive symptoms weigh more heavily toward relatively good sleep functioning in comparison to the study population.

Overall classification (PSQI distribution):
Balancing the multimodal evidence—particularly the high median sleep duration (Z = 1.59), absence of naps, low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and generally positive self-reports—against the smaller adverse signals (moderate trait anxiety and elevated intradaily variability), the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality rather than poorer sleep). Accordingly, the participant is classified as below the population median for PSQI (bottom 50%).

88008,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate elevated affective symptom burden relative to the study sample. The participant’s CES-D score (20; Z ≈ 0.7) and trait anxiety (STAI = 48; Z ≈ 0.66) are above the population mean and show moderately strong positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.50, STAI r ≈ 0.40), suggesting that mood and anxiety symptoms are likely contributors to poorer subjective sleep. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are below average (RSES Z ≈ -0.73; happiness Z ≈ -0.53) and correlate negatively with sleep quality in the sample, while reported stress is somewhat lower than average (Z ≈ -0.44). The participant reports little to no recreational substance use and engages in frequent exercise and sports (exercise/sports Z-scores 0.53–1.58), behavioral factors that typically support sleep health.

Objective sleep timing and duration: Wearable-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 9 minutes (Z ≈ -1.29), substantially shorter than the study mean and the population median. The median sleep start time is late (about 01:13), with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 77 min). Napping is minimal. Short sleep duration and late sleep onset are two objective features that commonly increase PSQI scores via domains for sleep duration, sleep latency/timing, and daytime dysfunction; in this dataset sleep duration shows a small positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.05) and sleep timing variability shows a modest positive correlation (r ≈ 0.18), so these objective deficits point toward worse overall sleep quality.

Circadian and physiological patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics are consistent with a robust, regular circadian profile. Interdaily stability (0.52; Z ≈ 0.91) and high amplitude (Z ≈ 1.48) indicate a relatively strong, consistent daily rhythm; intradaily variability is low (0.30; Z ≈ -1.73), indicating low fragmentation of the rhythm. Resting heart rate is relatively low (≈55 bpm; Z ≈ -0.36). Hourly aggregate heart rate deviations show the expected large nocturnal reductions (largest negative deviations between ~2–5 AM) and pronounced evening increases around 5–9 PM; these patterns imply consolidated nocturnal quiescence and a consistent phase of heightened evening activity. Taken together, physiological indicators support a consolidated and regular sleep–wake rhythm despite the late timing of sleep onset.

Synthesis and implication for PSQI placement: Several lines of evidence pull in different directions. Protective factors that predict better PSQI in this sample include strong circadian regularity, low intradaily fragmentation, frequent exercise, and minimal substance use. Countervailing factors that predict worse PSQI include objectively short nightly sleep (≈6h), late habitual sleep onset (~1:13 AM), and elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (which have relatively large positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset). Given the substantial shortfall in sleep duration (Z ≈ -1.29) combined with elevated mood and anxiety symptom burden—both of which are among the stronger correlates of PSQI here—the overall balance of evidence suggests the participant’s global PSQI score is more likely to fall in the worse half of the study distribution rather than the better half. There is some uncertainty because circadian regularity and low fragmentation are favorable, but on balance the negative influences (short sleep and affective symptoms) are sufficiently salient to support classification into the top half (higher PSQI/worse sleep quality).

83566,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological profile and self-report indicators:
The participant reports marked elevations on affective symptom measures: a CES-D score of 37 (Z = 2.47) and an STAI–Trait score of 62 (Z = 2.05). Both symptom indices have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40), indicating that higher depressive and anxiety symptom burden in this cohort is meaningfully associated with poorer reported sleep quality. Self-esteem and current happiness are comparatively low (RSES score 29, Z = -1.29; happiness 2.0, Z = -1.61), and these variables are negatively correlated with PSQI in the population (higher self-esteem/happiness associated with better sleep). Stress is somewhat elevated (score 24, Z = 0.65). Taken together, the self-report profile shows substantial affective distress and low positive affect, which in this study’s data set is associated with worse PSQI scores and greater subjective sleep problems.

Behavioral sleep metrics from wearables and self-report:
Fitbit-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 8 hours 8 minutes (Z = 1.18) and relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 65 minutes, Z = -0.82). The participant reports virtually no naps (mean daily naps 0.0, Z = -0.86). These objective duration metrics typically align with adequate objective sleep quantity and, in isolation, would tend to predict average or better PSQI scores (population correlation ~0.05, i.e., weak). However, the median sleep start time is late (01:52), with modest variability (sleep start SD 66 minutes). Late habitual sleep onset can reflect a delayed sleep schedule and is modestly positively correlated with PSQI in this sample (corr ≈ 0.18), suggesting that despite long total sleep, timing (and possibly sleep latency or daytime impairment) may undermine subjective sleep quality.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate elevated basal cardiovascular tone: resting heart rate = 69.4 (Z = 1.34) and MESOR = 84.83 (Z = 1.49). Amplitude is only modestly elevated (11.63, Z = 0.27), and the estimated acrophase is in the late afternoon (≈ 4:51 PM), consistent with a diurnal peak of cardiovascular activity. The aggregated hourly deviations show the expected large nocturnal reductions relative to mesor (nadir around 5–6 AM at ~-18 bpm) and daytime elevations (~+10–12 bpm in early-to-mid afternoon). Interdaily stability (0.42, Z ≈ 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.43, Z = 0.90) indicate a reasonably consistent daily structure overall, while intradaily variability is modest (0.58, Z = 0.24). Elevated resting HR and MESOR suggest higher tonic physiological arousal across days; in this dataset these cardiovascular features have small positive correlations with PSQI (resting HR r ≈ 0.12, MESOR r ≈ 0.06), consistent with the possibility that elevated baseline arousal contributes to perceived or actual sleep disruption.

Behavioral correlates and lifestyle:
The participant reports minimal substance use and no daytime naps, which are generally protective for sleep. Conversely, exercise frequency is low (exercised alone 1–2 times/month, exercised with others not at all), and recreational/social activities are limited; both lower physical activity and reduced social engagement can negatively affect mood and sleep consolidation. Academic performance (GPA) appears intact. Overall, lifestyle indicators show limited engagement in behaviors that typically support sleep and mood regulation.

Synthesis regarding sleep quality and PSQI placement:
There is a mixed pattern of objective and subjective indicators. Objective sleep quantity is above average for the cohort (median duration > 8 hours, low variability), and circadian measures show reasonably consistent day-to-day timing. However, the participant demonstrates high depressive and anxiety symptom burden (strongest signals in the dataset), low positive affect/self-esteem, late habitual sleep timing, and elevated resting heart rate/MESOR suggesting tonic physiological arousal. In this study population, affective symptoms (CES-D, STAI) have relatively strong positive correlations with PSQI (approximately 0.49 and 0.40), whereas objective duration measures show little association with PSQI. Given the strong affective symptom load, late sleep timing, and elevated baseline physiological arousal—all features that are tied to worse subjective sleep in the sample—the balance of evidence favors poorer overall sleep quality as captured by the PSQI.

Conclusion (PSQI group):
Based on the integrated multimodal profile—high depressive and anxiety symptoms (strong PSQI correlates), late habitual sleep timing, and elevated resting heart rate despite objectively long sleep duration—the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of PSQI scores in this study population.

The participant reports a substantive burden of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 28, Z = +1.53) accompanied by elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = +0.27) and elevated perceived stress (Score = 26, Z = +1.19). Self-esteem is slightly below the cohort mean (RSES = 36, Z = −0.31) and momentary happiness and health satisfaction are modestly lower than average (happiness Z = −0.53; health satisfaction Z = −0.53). Substance use is minimal, but physical activity is notably low (multiple exercise items with Z ≤ −1.58 to −1.93), while sedentary and screen-based recreational behaviors are substantially above average (internet usage Z = +2.19; listening to music Z = +2.06; watching video content Z = +1.91). This combination—elevated depressive symptoms and stress, low physical activity, and high evening/overall screen time—constitutes a behavioral profile that is commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality.

Subjective and wearables-derived sleep behavior:
Fitbit-derived median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 43 minutes (Z = −0.58), which is somewhat shorter than the cohort mean. Sleep onset is late and irregular: median sleep start time is approximately 02:00 AM with a large night-to-night variability in sleep-start (SD = 145 minutes, Z = +1.36). Nightly sleep duration variability is also elevated (SD ≈ 114 minutes, Z = +0.30). The participant takes occasional naps (mean daily naps 0.18, Z = +1.27). Subjective indicators in the survey align with psychosocial stressors that correlate positively with PSQI in this cohort (CES-D and STAI show moderate positive correlations with PSQI), suggesting the participant’s subjective experience is likely to include disturbed or non-restorative sleep.

Circadian rhythm and cardiovascular physiology:
Cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics indicate a relatively weak and irregular circadian structure in heart-rate–based rhythms. Interdaily stability is low (0.27, Z = −1.15) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is very low (0.10, Z = −1.87), both consistent with reduced day-to-day regularity of activity/rest timing. Intradaily variability is elevated (0.75, Z = +1.44), indicating more fragmented or frequent transitions between rest and activity states across the day. Resting heart rate and mean mesor are elevated compared with the cohort (resting HR = 69.4 bpm, Z = +1.34; mesor = 85.35, Z = +1.56), which can reflect higher physiological arousal or lower cardiovascular recovery. The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal reductions and afternoon/evening peaks, but some early-morning hours have deviations that correlate positively with PSQI in this sample, consistent with sleep disruption impacting overnight physiology.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality:
Multiple independent indicators point toward comparatively poorer sleep quality. Shorter-than-average total sleep time, very late and variable sleep onset, elevated sleep onset variability, and occasional napping all increase the likelihood of greater PSQI scores. Objective circadian measures (low interdaily stability, low 24‑hour autocorrelation, and high intradaily variability) indicate an irregular and fragmented rest–activity rhythm, which is frequently associated with worse subjective sleep quality. Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety—both of which correlate positively with PSQI in this cohort—provide additional evidence favoring increased sleep complaints. Low physical activity and high evening screen/sedentary behaviors are behavioral contributors that commonly worsen sleep timing and continuity. Taken holistically, these convergent signals (behavioral, psychological, and physiological) are most consistent with membership in the higher-PSQI (worse sleep) half of the study distribution.

The participant’s CES-D score is 29 (Z = 1.63), and STAI–Trait is 54 (Z = 1.25), both indicating substantially higher depressive symptoms and trait anxiety than peers; these scales also show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), suggesting these elevations are relevant to poorer sleep. Rosenberg self-esteem is reduced (score 32, Z ≈ −0.87) and shows a negative correlation with PSQI (r ≈ −0.35), consistent with the general pattern that lower self-esteem accompanies worse subjective sleep. Global stress and momentary happiness are near-sample-average (Stress Z = 0.38; Happy Z = 0.55), but health satisfaction is notably low (Z ≈ −1.61), signaling some perceived health concerns that may interact with affective symptoms and sleep.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: The participant reports minimal organized physical activity (exercise and sports marked “not at all,” Z-scores −1.58 to −1.93), very limited socializing (Z ≈ −2.20), and no substance use. Daily leisure is characterized by prolonged sedentary hobbies and heavy passive media use (sedentary hobby Z = 3.19; listening to music Z = 2.06; video games Z = 2.47). These behavioral patterns—low daytime activity, high sedentary engagement, and reduced social interaction—are commonly associated with poorer sleep consolidation and later timing, and several of these domains have modest correlations with PSQI in the sample (small positive correlations for some sedentary and media use items).

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular profile: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a mixed picture of regularity and damped amplitude. The mesor (mean fitted HR) is elevated at 83.09 (Z = 1.25) and resting heart rate is higher than average (70.3 bpm, Z = 1.44), indicating higher baseline cardiovascular tone across the recording period. The 24-hour autocorrelation is relatively high (0.46, Z = 1.15), consistent with day-to-day regularity, while interdaily stability is near average (0.42, Z = 0.09) and intradaily variability is somewhat low (0.47, Z = −0.53), suggesting lower fragmentation within days. Amplitude from cosinor analysis is reduced (9.34, Z = −0.47), implying a blunted diurnal HR rhythm even though timing of acrophase (peak) at ~4:49 PM appears typical for an afternoon phase. Hourly deviation profiles show the expected nocturnal HR decline (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM), supporting that physiological nighttime quiescence occurs, but the elevated resting HR and reduced amplitude point to a somewhat blunted and higher-toned cardiovascular state that can be associated with sleep disturbance.

Sleep behavior and sleep-wake timing: Objective sleep statistics from the wearable indicate relatively short and inconsistent nocturnal sleep. Median nightly duration is 6 hours 15 minutes (Z ≈ −1.15), below the sample median, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is high (SD = 168 minutes, Z = 1.52). The median sleep start time is late (about 00:30), with moderate variability in sleep onset (SD = 89 minutes, Z ≈ 0.14). Daytime napping is more frequent than typical for the sample (mean daily naps 0.3, Z = 2.66). Both shorter average duration and greater variability in duration/onset are positively correlated with PSQI in the population (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.19; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18), indicating these objective features likely contribute to worse subjective sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation and PSQI placement: Multiple lines of evidence converge on a profile more consistent with poorer sleep quality. Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms—both of which correlate substantially with PSQI—co-occur with objectively shorter, more variable nocturnal sleep, later sleep timing, increased napping, low daytime activity, high sedentary behavior, and elevated resting heart rate with reduced circadian amplitude. Although some indices of day-to-day regularity (24‑hour autocorrelation) and low intradaily fragmentation could mitigate extremes of circadian disruption, the aggregate pattern (affective burden + short, inconsistent sleep + physiological signs of higher baseline arousal) aligns with the set of predictors associated with higher PSQI scores in this sample. Given the participant’s position on these key predictors and the population percentiles (sample 50th percentile PSQI = 6.0; mean = 6.71), the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely worse than the median of the study population.

82728,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate a generally low burden of internalizing symptoms and a resilient psychosocial profile. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D (score = 11, Z ≈ -0.24) and trait anxiety on the STAI (score = 39, Z ≈ -0.23) are both below the study mean, and global self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 37, Z ≈ -0.17). The participant reports low substance use (alcohol and drugs well below cohort averages) and engages in regular solo exercise (three times a week or more; Z ≈ 1.07), which are both behaviors commonly associated with better sleep. Subjective well-being indicators are mixed: current happiness is somewhat below the cohort mean (Z ≈ -0.53) and health satisfaction is modestly lower than average (Z ≈ -0.45), while perceived stress is near the cohort mean (Z ≈ 0.1). Overall, the psychological and lifestyle data point toward low psychiatric symptom burden, healthy activity levels, and limited substance exposure — factors that tend to protect sleep quality.

Sleep timing and duration patterns: Wearable-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 59 minutes (Z ≈ -0.25), essentially near the cohort median and within a typical range for young adults. The participant has a late habitual sleep onset (median start time ≈ 01:05 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 93 minutes, Z ≈ 0.21). Nightly sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 92 minutes, Z ≈ -0.21) is not elevated relative to the cohort. The participant records essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z ≈ -0.86). Taken together, the sleep quantity is close to average for the study population but is characterized by a delayed timing preference and some irregularity in bedtimes.

Circadian and physiological regulation: Heart rate-based circadian metrics indicate a well-structured and robust diurnal rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (value = 0.50, Z ≈ 0.75) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (Z ≈ 1.06), consistent with consistent daily timing of activity and rest. Amplitude of the fitted cosinor is notably above the cohort mean (amplitude ≈ 15.56 bpm, Z ≈ 1.54), indicating a pronounced daytime–nighttime separation in cardiovascular activation; the reported acrophase (~4:54 PM) is within an expected waking-phase window. Resting heart rate (≈60.2 bpm, Z ≈ 0.24) and mesor (≈76.5 bpm, Z ≈ 0.35) are near cohort averages. Hourly aggregate deviations show the largest nocturnal heart rate decreases overnight (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and the greatest positive deviation late afternoon to early evening (peak ~5–6 PM, +27 bpm, Z ≈ 2.47). Overall, these features indicate consistent day-to-night physiological modulation and low circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability relatively low, Z ≈ -0.53), which support consolidated nocturnal sleep even if the sleep window begins late.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): Indicators that argue for relatively good or average sleep quality include near-average total sleep time (~7 hours), absence of daytime napping, strong and regular circadian organization (high interdaily stability and elevated amplitude), low depressive and anxiety symptom levels, regular exercise, and minimal substance use. Features that could detract from sleep quality are the late median sleep onset (~1:05 AM) and modest variability in sleep start time; these may contribute to subjective complaints in domains such as sleep latency or perceived dysfunction if daytime obligations require earlier wake times. Correlations provided in the dataset suggest that depressive symptoms and anxiety are positively associated with poorer PSQI scores, but this participant’s scores on those measures are low. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (near-average sleep duration, robust circadian physiology, low psychiatric symptom burden, active lifestyle, and minimal substance use) supports placement in the lower half of the cohort distribution for PSQI (i.e., better/average sleep quality rather than relatively poor sleep).

Perceived stress is notably high (Stress score = 29; Z = 2.01), representing one of the more extreme deviations in the self-report set and a variable that is positively associated with poorer PSQI in the study correlations. Self-esteem appears elevated relative to the sample (reported RSES value with Z = 1.38); there is a possible scoring inconsistency in the raw self-esteem value, but the sample-relative Z-score indicates this participant scores substantially higher on self-worth than peers. Global happiness and health satisfaction are somewhat below the sample mean (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95). Overall, the self-report profile is mixed: protective factors (high self‑esteem, frequent exercise) are present, but elevated stress and somewhat greater anxiety are salient and carry known associations with worse subjective sleep.

Lifestyle and behavioral habits: The participant engages in frequent physical activity and sports (exercise and sports reported three times per week or more; Zs > 1), a behavioral pattern typically associated with better sleep outcomes. Alcohol and other substance use are minimal (no beer, rare recreational drug use; wine 1–2×/week), and daily napping is essentially absent. Time spent on potentially sleep-disrupting screen activities is low (internet usage 15 minutes or less; Z ≈ -1.83). Evening recreational media use (TV/videos 1–2 hours; Z ≈ 1.28) is somewhat higher than average and could influence sleep timing. These habits suggest generally health-promoting daytime behaviors (exercise, low substance use) but some evening screen time and a late habitual bedtime that may counteract protective effects.

Wearable-derived sleep timing and duration: Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate median nightly sleep duration of about 7 hours 38 minutes (Z ≈ 0.56), which is above the cohort mean and consistent with sufficient objective sleep quantity. Night-to-night variability in duration is moderate (SD ≈ 96 minutes; Z ≈ -0.10), and naps are infrequent (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07). Median sleep start time is late (00:57) with a standard deviation of about 63 minutes (Z ≈ -0.44), showing a tendency toward late bedtimes but not extreme irregularity. Taken together, wearable-derived duration is favorable for sleep quantity, yet the delayed sleep timing may impair subjective sleep quality or alignment with social schedules.

Circadian and cardiac physiology: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian features show a modestly damped amplitude (amplitude = 9.42; Z ≈ -0.44) and lower-than-average MESOR (70.3 bpm; Z ≈ -0.49), while resting heart rate is near sample average (≈57.8 bpm; Z ≈ -0.04). Interdaily stability is lower than average (0.32; Z ≈ -0.74), indicating somewhat less consistent day-to-day heart rate timing, whereas autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively strong (0.42; Z ≈ 0.81), suggesting there is still a reliable 24‑hour structure present. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.59; Z ≈ 0.32), consistent with modest within-day fragmentation. Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations ~ -15 bpm between ~2–6 AM) and clear, large daytime peaks in the late afternoon (~3–5 PM deviations +17 to +25 bpm with high positive Z-scores), indicating a preserved and behaviorally driven daytime activity peak and nocturnal quiescence. Overall, physiology supports an intact day-night separation of activity and rest, but with somewhat lower amplitude and reduced day-to-day regularity.

Integration and implications for sleep quality: Objective sleep quantity is good (median >7.5 hours) and physiological data show clear nocturnal heart-rate reductions, both of which are features associated with adequate sleep. However, the participant’s late habitual sleep onset (~1:00 AM), elevated perceived stress (Z ≈ 2.01), and mildly elevated anxiety are notable countervailing factors that in the study correlate with poorer PSQI scores (stress and depression correlations with PSQI are positive; CES-D correlation = 0.49, STAI correlation = 0.4, Stress correlation = 0.2). Circadian analytics indicate reduced interdaily regularity and slightly elevated intraday fragmentation, both small contributors to worse subjective sleep in the cohort. Protective influences such as high self‑esteem, frequent exercise, low substance use, and adequate sleep duration likely buffer some subjective impairment, but the strength of the stress signal and the late sleep timing argue for increased subjective sleep complaints relative to peers.

PSQI group assignment: Considering the pattern—objectively sufficient sleep duration but late timing, pronounced and unusually high perceived stress, modest anxiety, some circadian irregularity, and study correlations linking those psychosocial factors to worse PSQI—I assess that the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of the cohort PSQI distribution (top 50%). This judgment weighs the strong deviation in stress and its known association with PSQI more heavily than the objective duration advantage.

Self-reported well-being is relatively high (Happiness = 5; Z = 1.64) and perceived health satisfaction is also elevated (6/7; Z = 1.3). Self-esteem is above the sample mean (RSES Z = 0.68). These self-report indicators collectively point toward a generally positive affective and psychosocial profile across the semester, with only modest reported stress (Score = 23; Z = 0.38). Behavioral engagement is likewise active: the participant reports exercising three or more times per week both alone and with others (exercise Z-scores > 1.0) and spends several hours socializing daily (Z = 0.95). These protective behavioral and psychological features are typically associated with better subjective sleep quality.

Sleep timing and quantity (wearable + self-report): Median nightly sleep duration as measured by the wearable is approximately 6 hours 58 minutes (Z = -0.27), which is close to the study mean and within a normative range for young adults. Napping is rare (mean daily naps 0.07; Z ≈ 0). However, variability in sleep timing and duration is elevated: standard deviation of nightly sleep duration is 135 minutes (Z = 0.77) and sleep start time standard deviation is 154 minutes (Z = 1.55). The median bedtime is late evening (about 23:39). The combination of near-normal median sleep duration with notable night-to-night variability and inconsistent sleep start times suggests that while total sleep quantity is adequate on average, the participant’s sleep schedule is irregular—an aspect that commonly contributes to worse subjective sleep quality.

Circadian and cardiovascular activity patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian summary metrics indicate a low level of day-to-day regularity in cardiovascular rhythm (Interdaily Stability = 0.29; Z = -0.99) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.16; Z = -1.37), consistent with inconsistent daily timing across the recording period. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.61; Z = 0.46), indicating some fragmentation of activity across the day. The MESOR (mean HR level) is low (61.84; Z = -1.65) and resting heart rate is low (48.3 bpm; Z = -1.17), a pattern consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregated deviations show expected pronounced nighttime troughs (large negative deviations between ~12:00–6:00 AM) and marked daytime peaks (notably strong positive deviations mid/late morning and late afternoon, e.g., 10–1 PM and 5–6 PM with high Z-scores). Overall, the physiological profile reflects a well-conditioned cardiovascular baseline but with relatively weak coupling of daily heart-rate rhythm to a stable 24-hour schedule.

Integrative interpretation regarding sleep quality: Protective features for subjective sleep quality include low depressive and anxiety symptom burden, high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, frequent exercise, and near-normal median sleep duration. Countervailing risk factors are frequent alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor reported three times per week or more; Z ≈ 1.7) and clear instability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start time SD Z = 1.55; interdaily stability Z = -0.99). The wearable-derived circadian metrics and elevated night-to-night variability are recognized contributors to poorer subjective sleep quality even when mean sleep duration is adequate. Correlations provided in the dataset indicate that variability and mood symptoms relate to PSQI, but here mood-related risk is low while variability and alcohol use are elevated.

Conclusion on PSQI group placement: Balancing the evidence, the participant exhibits more protective than detrimental features with respect to sleep quality: adequate median sleep duration, low affective symptom burden, frequent exercise, and low napping favor relatively good/average sleep quality. The strongest concerns are irregular sleep timing/variability and frequent alcohol use, which increase risk for poorer subjective sleep quality but do not, in this case, appear to outweigh the multiple protective indicators. On balance, the profile is more consistent with a PSQI score in the lower or middle part of the study distribution (i.e., not among the worst half).

Scores on the CES-D (score = 6) and trait STAI (37) are below the study mean (negative Z-scores) and are classified as “not depressed” and “not anxious,” respectively; both depression and trait anxiety correlate positively with worse PSQI in this sample, so these low scores argue in favor of comparatively better sleep quality. Self-esteem and health-satisfaction are elevated (high Z-scores), and substance use is minimal. The participant reports frequent exercise (three times a week or more, both alone and with others), low sedentary/leisure screen time, and little use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. These lifestyle features—low affective symptoms, good perceived health, regular exercise, and limited substance/screen exposure—are each associated with more favorable sleep patterns in the literature and within the present sample correlations.

Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 hours 42 minutes (Z ≈ -0.6), with a moderate night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 84 minutes; Z ≈ -0.37) and relatively stable sleep onset timing (median start ≈ 23:55; start-time SD ≈ 57 minutes, Z ≈ -0.57). Napping is rare (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08). These values suggest slightly shorter-than-average sleep duration in this population but greater regularity in timing and modest variability compared with peers. Regular sleep timing and lower night-to-night variability are features that typically protect against poor subjective sleep quality; however, the sub-seven-hour median sleep duration is a modest risk factor for reduced restorative sleep if sustained.

Cardiovascular and circadian physiology from wearables:
The participant’s resting heart rate is unusually low (46.2 bpm; Z ≈ -1.42), consistent with a high fitness/athletic profile and generally associated with better sleep health in this dataset. Cosinor-derived mesor is also low (Z ≈ -1.49) while amplitude is modestly elevated (Z ≈ 0.46), and acrophase falls in early afternoon (≈1:53 PM), indicating a clear day–night rhythm of heart rate with appreciable daytime–nighttime contrast. Nonparametric circadian measures are near the sample mean: interdaily stability is slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.24) and intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.32), suggesting a generally regular but not perfectly consistent daily structure with some within-day fragmentation. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal troughs (large negative deviations overnight) and large daytime peaks—notably large positive deviations in the early morning and mid-afternoon, the latter (4–5 PM) being an outlier positive spike—consistent with periods of daytime activity/exercise. Overall, the physiological profile points to a well-entrained circadian amplitude and likely regular daytime activity bouts (exercise or classes) with low resting cardiac arousal, which are features typically linked to better subjective sleep.

Weighing evidence for PSQI rank (top vs bottom half):
Evidence pointing toward relatively good or average PSQI (bottom 50th percentile): low depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D and STAI), high self-esteem and health satisfaction, frequent exercise, low substance use, regular sleep timing and relatively low night-to-night variability, low resting heart rate and clear daytime–nighttime HR contrast. Many of these features are either negatively correlated with PSQI in the sample (i.e., higher values predict better PSQI) or are established protective factors for sleep. Evidence pointing toward worse PSQI (top 50th percentile): median sleep duration is slightly under seven hours (≈6 h 42 min), which is below optimal recommendations and could contribute to worse PSQI if accompanied by daytime impairment; intradaily HR variability is mildly elevated, which can relate to fragmented daily structure. However, these risk signals are modest in magnitude compared with the multiple protective indicators above.

Conclusion:
On balance, the multimodal data (low affective symptoms, high self-rated health and self-esteem, frequent exercise, low substance use, stable sleep timing, low RHR, and clear circadian amplitude) point toward relatively favorable sleep quality compared with the study population. The small negative features (slightly short median sleep duration and modest intradaily variability) do not outweigh the cumulative protective profile. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively good/average sleep quality).

46365,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports modest affective symptoms overall. Depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 12, classified as not depressed; Z ≈ -0.14 relative to the sample), while trait anxiety is elevated relative to the cohort (STAI = 45, Z ≈ 0.37), indicating a moderate tendency toward anxiety proneness. Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40), and perceived stress is below average (Stress Z ≈ -0.44). Health satisfaction is relatively low (score 2.33, Z ≈ -1.45), and self-rated happiness and interpersonal trust are slightly below the sample mean. Taken together, the self-report profile indicates generally intact mood and functioning with some elevated anxiety and lower satisfaction with personal health; correlations supplied in the dataset indicate anxiety and depressive symptoms are the strongest survey-level associates of poorer PSQI, but this participant shows low depressive symptoms and only modestly elevated anxiety.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators:
Daily activities suggest a pattern of late-night social and screen-based engagement. The participant reports more than four hours per day of internet use and more than four hours of socializing with friends (both high Z-scores), while passive media activities such as TV and gaming are minimal. Alcohol use (beer) is relatively frequent (three times a week or more; Z ≈ 1.72). Exercise frequency is low to moderate (sports 1–2 times per week). These habits — frequent late-night socializing and heavy internet use combined with regular alcohol consumption — are behaviorally consistent with a later sleep schedule and represent plausible contributors to subjective sleep disturbance or reduced sleep opportunity despite otherwise adequate sleep time.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics:
Heart-rate based circadian analyses indicate a modestly elevated mesor (mean heart-rate level ≈ 77.1 bpm; Z ≈ 0.43) with typical amplitude and an acrophase in the early evening (≈ 6:09 PM). Resting heart rate is comparatively low (≈ 55.8 bpm; Z ≈ -0.28). Nonparametric circadian regularity metrics (interdaily stability, intradaily variability, and 24-hour autocorrelation) are lower than the cohort average (Zs ≈ -0.9 to -1.4), indicating weaker, less stereotyped day-to-day structure in heart rate rhythms. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal dips in heart rate and prominent evening/late-night elevations (notably around 11pm–12am and midnight–1am). Overall, the physiology suggests preserved sleep-period cardiovascular downregulation but reduced regularity of daily rhythms, compatible with variable timing of activities and late-evening physiological activation.

Sleep timing and duration patterns:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate median nightly sleep duration of approximately 7 hours 16 minutes (Z ≈ 0.11), with sleep-duration variability slightly lower than the cohort mean (SD ≈ 91 minutes, Z ≈ -0.23). Median sleep start time is late (01:34 AM) but night-to-night timing stability is reasonable (sleep start SD ≈ 62 minutes, Z ≈ -0.47). Mean daily naps are infrequent but above the cohort mean (≈ 0.17 naps/day, Z ≈ 1.09). In sum, the participant obtains a total nightly sleep duration in the range commonly considered adequate for adults and shows relatively low night-to-night variability in duration, but maintains a late and socially oriented sleep schedule with occasional daytime napping.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI-relevant features):
There is a mixed multimodal signal with both protective and risk indicators for subjective sleep quality. Protective elements include total nightly sleep time near or slightly above the cohort mean, relatively low variability in sleep duration, and a low resting heart rate. Risk elements include a consistently late sleep onset (1:34 AM), high evening/late-night physiological activation, reduced interdaily circadian stability, frequent alcohol consumption, elevated internet/social activity in late hours, and modest trait anxiety. Correlational cues in the dataset show depressive symptoms and anxiety have the strongest positive associations with worse PSQI; this participant’s depressive symptoms are low while anxiety is modestly elevated, suggesting only a moderate contribution to poorer PSQI from mood. The physiological indices point to weaker circadian regularity, which often corresponds with poorer subjective sleep quality even when total duration is adequate.

PSQI group assessment (top vs bottom half of population):
Weighing objective sleep duration and low variability (both favorable) against late sleep timing, reduced circadian stability, late-night behavioral activation, and some alcohol use and anxiety (unfavorable), the preponderance of evidence indicates average-to-good overall sleep functioning rather than pronounced poor sleep. The available objective and self-report indicators that most strongly predict higher PSQI (notably depressive symptoms and very high anxiety) are not prominent here. Therefore, it is more likely that this participant’s PSQI score falls in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., lower/median PSQI values indicating relatively better sleep quality).

23287,3.0,0.015706806282722512,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports low scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43), with near-average self-esteem (RSES = 38, Z ≈ 0). Perceived stress is below the cohort mean (Score = 18, Z = -0.98) and health satisfaction is notably high (Z = 1.71). These self-report indicators collectively point toward relatively low affective burden and reasonable psychological well-being during the recording period. Behavioral habits that can influence sleep—substance use is essentially absent, exercise frequency is above average particularly when done with others (Z = 1.23), and recreational screen activities are mixed (internet use is elevated, Z = 1.52, while time spent watching video or gaming is low). Overall, the self-report data do not indicate prominent mood-driven contributors to poor sleep.

Wearable-derived sleep behaviors and timing: Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 8 hours 23 minutes (Z = 1.49), which is substantially above the study mean and suggests ample total sleep time. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (about 00:56) with a moderate night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 130 minutes, Z = 0.67). Mean daily naps are elevated relative to peers (0.25 naps/day, Z = 2.07). These findings describe a pattern of long total sleep opportunity but with relatively late sleep timing, nontrivial night-to-night variability in sleep length, and occasional daytime napping—features that can coexist with objectively long sleep duration but may nonetheless reflect irregular sleep habits.

Circadian and physiological markers: Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate a robust amplitude (Amplitude Z = 0.56) with modest interdaily stability (0.45, Z = 0.33) and intradaily variability near the cohort mean (0.57, Z = 0.17). The mesor and resting heart rate are both unusually low (Mesor 57.82, Z = -2.20; resting HR 40.6 bpm, Z = -2.09), consistent with high cardiovascular fitness or a low basal sympathetic tone. Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations around 3–6 AM) and marked evening elevations, especially between ~9–11 PM (10–11 PM deviation Z = 2.37). This pattern suggests normal nocturnal physiological downregulation paired with relatively elevated evening cardiovascular activity prior to sleep onset, which could reflect late-day arousal or activity proximate to the bedtime window.

Integrative interpretation for sleep quality: Several converging signals support reasonably good sleep quantity and baseline physiological regulation—above-average total sleep time, strong circadian amplitude, consistent nocturnal heart-rate declines, and low affective symptom burden. Countervailing signals that could negatively influence perceived sleep quality include a late median sleep onset (≈1 AM), moderate variability in nightly sleep length (SD Z = 0.67), elevated napping (Z = 2.07), and increased evening physiological activation (heart-rate elevations near 9–11 PM). Correlations provided in the dataset indicate only modest associations of these metrics with PSQI in this cohort, but the particular combination here (long total sleep, late timing and variability, occasional naps, low mood/anxiety) is more consistent with preserved objective sleep opportunity and fitness rather than fragmented or severely disturbed sleep.

Overall PSQI grouping judgment: Balancing the evidence, the preponderance of objective and self-report indicators favors relatively good or average sleep quality within the study population. The participant’s long median nightly sleep (Z = +1.49), absence of mood/anxiety symptoms that commonly co-occur with poor sleep, strong circadian amplitude, and low resting heart rate point toward a PSQI in the lower half of the cohort distribution (i.e., not in the most impaired sleep group). Factors that would push toward worse PSQI (late bedtimes, sleep variability, naps, evening arousal) are present but appear insufficient, in magnitude and in their cohort correlations, to outweigh the evidence for adequate sleep quantity and physiological regulation. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom 50% of PSQI scores (better/average sleep quality).

28247,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports elevated affective symptomatology that is relevant to sleep. Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 29, z = 1.63) and trait anxiety (STAI = 61, z = 1.95) are well above the study mean; both scales have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating these symptoms are likely to co-occur with poorer subjective sleep quality. Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES score = 31, z ≈ -1.0), and overall health satisfaction is also reduced (z ≈ -1.03); both of these are modestly associated with worse sleep in the sample. Reported stress is slightly above average (z ≈ 0.38). Taken together, the psychological profile—elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, lower self-esteem and health satisfaction—converges on risk factors that typically predict higher PSQI scores.

Sleep behavior and Fitbit-derived sleep statistics:
Objective sleep metrics indicate shortened and irregular nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 6 hours 26 minutes (z ≈ -0.94), placing the participant below the population mean for total sleep time. The median sleep start time is late (≈ 01:03 AM) and the standard deviation of sleep start time is very large (SD ≈ 208 minutes, z ≈ 2.74), indicating substantial night-to-night variability in bedtime. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is also notable (SD ≈ 119 minutes). There are essentially no naps recorded (mean daily naps = 0). The combination of a relatively short median duration, very late and highly variable bedtimes, and large variability in sleep timing is typically associated with poorer global sleep quality and greater likelihood of PSQI elevations.

Circadian rhythm and heart-rate-derived metrics:
Heart-rate circadian metrics show reduced regularity and amplitude. Interdaily stability is low (value = 0.23, z ≈ -1.48), indicating weak day-to-day consistency of the circadian pattern, while intradaily variability is elevated (value = 0.76, z ≈ 1.51), which reflects greater fragmentation and more frequent transitions in physiological state within days. Cosinor amplitude is reduced (5.8, z ≈ -1.61), consistent with a blunted circadian amplitude. MESOR and resting heart rate are near or slightly above average (MESOR ≈ 75 bpm, z ≈ 0.15; resting HR ≈ 62.2 bpm, z ≈ 0.48). The aggregated hourly deviations from the MESOR show a typical nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations around 4–6 AM) and daytime positive deviations, with an acrophase around mid-late afternoon (≈ 4:08 PM). Overall, these features point to a circadian system that is present but less robust and less stable across days—features that are commonly linked to worse sleep quality.

Lifestyle and behavioral context:
Daily behavior patterns that may influence sleep are mixed. The participant reports very low physical activity (exercise frequencies with large negative z-scores), which can reduce sleep drive and circadian entrainment. Substance use is low (infrequent alcohol, no recreational/non-prescribed drug use), which would tend to reduce some sleep-disrupting influences. Social and recreational behaviors are notable for high time spent socializing and listening to music (both high z-scores), activities that—depending on timing—could contribute to late bedtimes and variable schedules. Overall, low exercise and pronounced social/recreational evening activity fit with the late and irregular sleep timing observed.

Synthesis with respect to PSQI distribution:
Multiple independent sources converge on a pattern consistent with poorer sleep quality. Strong indicators include markedly elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (both moderately-to-strongly correlated with PSQI in this sample), late median sleep timing with very high night-to-night variability in sleep start times (SD z ≈ 2.74), shorter-than-average median sleep duration (z ≈ -0.94), low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.48), high intradaily variability (z ≈ 1.51), and reduced circadian amplitude (z ≈ -1.61). These objective and self-report features are each individually associated with higher PSQI scores and, in aggregate, point toward sleep quality worse than the cohort median. There is little countervailing evidence of particularly good sleep (e.g., no consistent long duration, consistent bedtimes, or restorative subjective health ratings). On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports classifying this participant’s PSQI as in the upper half of the study distribution (worse sleep quality).

72806,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z ≈ -0.86; STAI = 33, Z ≈ -0.82) and relatively high self-esteem (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11). Reported stress is near or slightly below the sample average (Score = 21, Z ≈ -0.17), substance use is minimal, and exercise is moderate (primarily solitary, 1–2×/week). These self-report characteristics—lower depressive and anxiety symptom burden, relatively robust self-esteem, limited substance exposure, and modest regular activity—are each associated in the literature with fewer sleep complaints and tend to predict more favorable PSQI components (sleep duration, sleep latency, and perceived sleep quality). Some subjective indicators are slightly less positive (health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.7; current happiness Z ≈ -0.53), but these are modest in magnitude and do not align with elevated mood symptom scores.

Wearable-derived sleep metrics: Objective sleep measures from the wearable indicate consolidated and reasonably stable sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 34 min (Z ≈ 0.47), which is above the study mean and consistent with recommended sleep amounts. Night-to-night variability in duration is relatively low (SD = 85 minutes, Z ≈ -0.36) and sleep start times are fairly consistent (median start ≈ 00:29, start-time SD ≈ 68 minutes, Z ≈ -0.32). Mean daily naps are low (0.13/day, Z ≈ 0.7), indicating infrequent daytime sleep. Collectively, these features suggest adequate objective sleep duration and regularity—factors that should map onto favorable PSQI domain scores for duration, habitual sleep efficiency/consistency, and daytime dysfunction.

Circadian and physiologic patterning: Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics reflect a reasonably well-structured rhythm. Interdaily stability is moderately above average (0.47, Z ≈ 0.5), intradaily variability is near the sample mean (0.55, Z ≈ 0.03), and cosinor amplitude is somewhat elevated (12.52, Z ≈ 0.56). Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.21). Aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (e.g., ~-21 to -22 bpm between ~2–5 AM) consistent with clear nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence. There is a pronounced evening/early-night spike (notably 6–7 PM: +25 bpm relative to mesor, Z ≈ 2.22) and smaller afternoon peaks (around 3–4 PM); these likely reflect concentrated periods of activity or physiological arousal in the late afternoon/evening rather than nocturnal hyperarousal. Overall the circadian and nocturnal heart-rate profile supports physiological sleep consolidation and restorative nocturnal downregulation.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI): Objective and subjective indicators converge toward relatively favorable sleep. The participant achieves above-average total sleep time with low night-to-night variability and consistent bedtimes, shows strong nocturnal heart-rate suppression, reports low mood and anxiety symptoms, and endorses healthy lifestyle behaviors (minimal substance use, modest exercise). Small counterpoints include a habitual sleep start time around 00:30 (later than some peers), slightly lower health satisfaction and happiness scores, and an elevated early-evening heart rate peak, but these appear secondary given the dominant pattern of adequate duration, regularity, and nocturnal physiological recovery. Correlations provided in the dataset between many of these measures and PSQI are small or mixed and do not negate the primary pattern of adequate objective sleep and low affective symptom burden.

PSQI group assignment (holistic judgment): Considering the study population distribution (population median PSQI = 6.0, mean ≈ 6.73) and the participant’s convergent evidence for adequate duration, consistency, and nocturnal physiological downregulation combined with low depressive/anxiety scores, the balance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to have a PSQI score in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively better sleep quality).

39146,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Sleep timing and duration: The wearable-recorded sleep pattern shows a consistently late sleep onset (median sleep start ~01:32 AM) combined with a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 48 minutes (z = -0.47 relative to the sample). Sleep onset timing shows moderate night-to-night variability (start-time SD ≈ 84 minutes, z ≈ 0.01), while night-to-night variability in total sleep duration is relatively low compared with the cohort (SD = 62 minutes, z = -0.89). The participant reports essentially no naps. Taken together, these indicators describe a sleep schedule shifted later than typical for the sample and a habitual sleep opportunity that is modestly shorter than the cohort mean, but with relatively stable total sleep duration across nights.

Circadian and cardiovascular profile: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a generally organized 24-hour profile but with some markers of elevated physiological tone. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is above average (z = 1.15), and interdaily stability is slightly above the sample mean (0.46, z = 0.42), suggesting a repeatable daily rhythm. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.62, z = 0.53), consistent with greater within-day fragmentation of activity/physiological state. MESOR and resting heart rate are both above average (MESOR 78.4 bpm, z = 0.61; resting HR 65.4 bpm, z = 0.86), while amplitude is near the cohort mean (z = 0.07) and acrophase (peak HR) occurs in the mid-afternoon (~3:57 PM). Hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions between ~1:00–7:00 AM (large negative deviations from mesor) but an attenuated evening decline: at ~10–11 PM the deviation is essentially zero (z ≈ -1.02 for the 10–11 PM hour), implying that cardiovascular arousal is not yet substantially reduced by late evening. Overall, the circadian profile is structured and repeatable, yet the relatively elevated resting HR and late-evening arousal are consistent with increased physiological activation around the participant’s habitual bedtime.

Psychological and behavioral context: Survey data indicate elevated stress (score 25, z = 0.92) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 42, z = 0.07), with depressive symptoms in the non-clinical range (CES-D = 11, z = -0.24). Self-reported happiness is below the sample mean (z = -0.53) while self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average. Lifestyle behaviors reveal very low substance use and no naps, but limited physical activity (exercise reported “less than 1–2 times a month” or “not at all”, z-scores strongly negative) and relatively high time spent on video games (1–2 hours; z = 2.47) and other sedentary screen-based activities (internet/music). These behavioral features—especially elevated stress/anxiety, late bedtimes, low exercise, and high evening screen time—are focal contributors that are plausibly linked to the observed late sleep timing and the attenuated evening decline in physiological arousal.

Evidence synthesis relevant to PSQI standing: Features supporting relatively poor sleep quality include the late habitual bedtime (~1:30 AM), average nightly sleep below 7 hours, elevated stress and trait anxiety, above-average resting heart rate, modestly increased intradaily variability, and behavioral patterns (low exercise, high evening screen time) that are commonly associated with worse subjective sleep. Features that would argue for more favorable sleep are the absence of naps and substances, a relatively stable total-sleep-duration profile across nights (low sleep-duration SD, z = -0.89), and a coherent 24-hour rhythm (high autocorrelation, interdaily stability above mean). Correlations provided within the dataset (e.g., CES-D and STAI showing moderate positive correlations with PSQI) align with the direction of concern in this participant (elevated stress/anxiety). On balance, the pattern indicates more than isolated risk factors: physiologic arousal late in the evening, psychosocial stress, late timing, and slightly reduced sleep opportunity combine to increase the likelihood of higher PSQI scores (worse sleep quality) than the cohort median.

PSQI group judgment: Considering the combination of late habitual sleep timing, slightly short nightly total sleep, elevated stress/anxiety, above-average resting heart rate, modest intraday fragmentation, and behavioral contributors (low exercise, high evening screen time), the preponderance of evidence points toward sleep quality that is poorer than the cohort median. Although some protective features (regular 24-h rhythm, low nap/substance use, stable sleep duration) are present, they are insufficient to offset the constellation of markers associated with worse subjective and physiological sleep. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of the study distribution for PSQI.

67918,3.0,0.015706806282722512,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62), with above-average self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.38) and relatively high health satisfaction (Z = 1.22). Reported stress and happiness are near the sample mean (stress Z = -0.17; happiness Z = -0.53) and substance use is essentially absent across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational or non-prescribed drugs (Z-scores strongly negative). Academic performance is high (GPAs ~3.9). Together, these self-report indices indicate a broadly low burden of mood and anxiety symptoms and positive self-evaluations—factors that, in this sample, tend to be associated with better sleep quality or at least lower risk for psychologically driven sleep disturbance.

Circadian and physiological regularity:
Wearable-derived circadian metrics point to a well-entrained and robust circadian pattern. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.59, Z = 1.49) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.52, Z = 1.65), indicating consistent day-to-day heart rate timing. Intradaily variability is low (0.37, Z = -1.24), suggesting limited fragmentation of activity/physiological states within days. Cosinor-derived amplitude is high (15.71, Z = 1.59) and mesor is above average (81.27, Z = 1.0) with an acrophase in the mid-afternoon (3:42 PM), consistent with a robust daytime physiological peak and clear nocturnal trough. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced negative deviations overnight (e.g., roughly -18 to -22 bpm relative to mesor between ~1–5 AM), indicating substantial nocturnal heart-rate lowering that aligns with consolidated nighttime rest. Resting heart rate (62.8 bpm, Z = 0.55) is modestly above the study mean but not extreme. Overall, the wearable physiology profile suggests regular, consolidated sleep/wake timing and strong circadian organization.

Objective sleep behavior and variability:
Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate long and consistent nocturnal sleep: median nightly sleep of approximately 8 hours 42 minutes (Z = 1.88), low night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 74 minutes, Z = -0.6), and a consistent sleep start time near 23:38 (SD ≈ 55 minutes, Z = -0.6). Mean daily naps are zero (Z = -0.86). These objective indices reflect greater-than-average sleep opportunity/duration and relatively stable sleep timing across the semester, with little evidence of frequent napping or sleep irregularity—behavioral features typically associated with better sleep quality.

Behavioral correlates relevant to sleep:
The participant reports minimal evening/behavioral risk factors: little screen/video gaming time, moderate internet/social time, and almost no substance use. The one potential negative behavioral factor is low frequency of exercise (mostly 1–2 times per month, Zs mildly negative), which can be associated with poorer sleep in some contexts; however, in this dataset exercise frequency has a small correlation with PSQI and the participant’s other favorable psychosocial and physiological indicators appear to outweigh this single low-activity item. Subjective health satisfaction is relatively high and naps are absent, both of which support consolidated nocturnal sleep.

Weighing evidence for low/median vs high PSQI:
Evidence supporting a low or median PSQI (better sleep; bottom 50 of PSQI scores) is substantial: objectively long median sleep duration (Z = 1.88), low intra-individual variability in sleep duration and start time (Zs ≈ -0.6), absence of naps, strong circadian regularity (high interdaily stability and 24-h autocorrelation, low intradaily variability, high amplitude), pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions, and low symptom burden on depression/anxiety measures. In contrast, evidence for a high PSQI (poorer sleep; top 50) is minimal—there is no signal of fragmented or highly variable sleep, frequent naps, problematic substance use, or marked mood dysregulation that would typically align with poor PSQI. Resting heart rate is slightly elevated relative to the sample mean (Z = 0.55), and exercise frequency is low, but these are modest concerns with small correlations to PSQI in this dataset.

Conclusion:
On balance, the multimodal evidence (self-report, wearable circadian physiology, and objective sleep metrics) converges on relatively good and stable sleep patterns compared with the study population. These features make it more likely that the participant’s PSQI score falls in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (bottom 50th percentile), indicating relatively better sleep quality.

34467,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report profile is characterized by low scores on depressive and anxiety symptom scales (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66; STAI-Trait = 33, Z = -0.82), high self-esteem (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and above-average momentary happiness (self-rated happy Z = 1.64). Health satisfaction is also elevated (Z = 0.8). Substance use is minimal or absent across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational drug items. Exercise habits indicate some regular activity, particularly social exercise (exercising with others reported three times per week or more, Z = 1.23). Together these data describe a student who reports generally positive mood, low affective symptom burden, limited substance exposure, and moderate-to-regular social physical activity—factors that typically support sleep quality and daytime functioning.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signals:
Cardiac circadian metrics show a relatively low mesor (58.35 bpm; Z = -2.13) and a low resting heart rate (45.6 bpm; Z = -1.49), consistent with a relatively low tonic cardiac rate. Nonparametric circadian indices indicate reduced day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.30, Z = -0.9) and elevated within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology (intradaily variability = 0.75, Z = 1.44). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations confirm a strong nocturnal decline (nighttime deviations around -17 to -24 bpm relative to mesor) and pronounced morning and evening activity peaks (e.g., 7–9am +17 to +18 bpm, 7–8pm +22 bpm). These findings point to preserved amplitude of daytime rises and nighttime declines in cardiac activity, but with less consistent timing across days and relatively greater fragmentation of activity within days.

Sleep behavior and sleep–physiology integration:
Nightly sleep characteristics derived from the wearable indicate a median sleep duration of 7 hours 24 minutes (Z = 0.28), which is near or slightly above typical values for the sample, and mean daily nap frequency is low (0.12/day). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 128 minutes, Z = 0.61) and especially in sleep start time (median start 23:34, SD = 134 minutes, Z = 1.12) are elevated, indicating irregular bedtimes and some inconsistency in sleep length. The combination of overall adequate median sleep duration with notable variability in timing suggests that while total sleep quantity is generally sufficient, the participant’s sleep schedule is not highly regular. The wearable circadian profile (lower interdaily stability and higher intradaily variability) reinforces this picture of schedule irregularity and more fragmented day–night patterns despite intact nocturnal cardiac reductions.

Synthesis regarding sleep quality (PSQI-relevant evidence):
Evidence supporting relatively good or average sleep quality includes adequate median sleep duration, low reported affective symptoms (which are commonly associated with better subjective sleep), minimal substance use, and regular physical activity—factors that typically relate to lower PSQI scores. Evidence pointing toward worse sleep quality includes elevated variability in sleep start time and moderate night-to-night variability in sleep duration, together with reduced interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability of physiological rhythms—features that are associated with sleep disturbance in many studies. Correlations in the dataset between these specific wearables metrics and PSQI are small to modest (e.g., sleep timing variability r ≈ 0.18, sleep duration variability r ≈ 0.20; circadian fragmentation correlates weakly), suggesting these circadian irregularities have only moderate associations with PSQI in the sample.

Overall assessment of PSQI group:
Balancing the evidence, the participant demonstrates multiple protective features for sleep quality (adequate median nightly sleep, low mood/anxiety symptoms, limited substance use, and regular exercise) that are likely to lower subjective sleep problems. Although circadian irregularity and night-to-night variability are present and could elevate PSQI scores, their associations with PSQI are modest in this dataset and do not outweigh the stronger pattern of favorable psychosocial and sleep-quantity indicators. On balance, the participant is most consistent with a PSQI score in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively better/average sleep quality).

59673,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The self-report battery indicates a generally favorable psychological profile. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43) are below the study mean, while self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 1.66). Self-reported happiness is modestly above average (Z = 0.55) and perceived stress is close to the sample mean (Z = 0.10). Health satisfaction is comparatively low (Z = -1.2), and body mass index is in the overweight range (BMI = 27.09). Substance and recreational use are low-to-moderate (wine/liquor ~1–2/week, beer ~1–2/month, no recreational drug use). Overall, the psychological and lifestyle data suggest intact mood and self-concept, low anxiety, moderate stress, and some health-related concerns that could plausibly influence sleep but are not strongly indicative of pervasive psychopathology.

Subjective and objective sleep habits: Wearable-recorded sleep duration is adequate on average: median nightly sleep is 7 hours 37 minutes (Z = 0.54), which is above the sample median and consistent with normative duration. However, sleep timing and regularity are notable features: median sleep start time is late (approximately 01:21 AM) with a moderately elevated night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 98 minutes, Z = 0.33) and a high variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 144 minutes, Z = 0.98). Daytime napping occurs above the sample mean (mean daily naps = 0.18, Z = 1.27). These patterns—late average bedtime combined with substantial night-to-night inconsistency and some napping—are behavioral characteristics that have been associated with diminished sleep quality in prior work and here show small positive correlations with PSQI (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18; naps r ≈ 0.17).

Wearable-derived physiological rhythms and arousal: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a generally present 24-hour rhythm but with signs of reduced day-to-day robustness and some intraday fragmentation. Interdaily stability is near average (0.42, Z = 0.09) while autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively low (0.24, Z = -0.70), suggesting weaker consistency of the rhythm across days. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.57, Z = 0.17), consistent with modestly more fragmented activity/physiology across the day. MESOR and amplitude values are close to sample norms (MESOR ≈ 74.7 bpm, amplitude ≈ 10.8 bpm). Resting heart rate is somewhat low (57.2 bpm, Z = -0.11), typical for a physically fit individual. The hourly aggregate deviations show expected nocturnal declines in heart rate (largest negative deviations ~ -19 to -21 bpm between ~3–6 AM) but also relatively high deviations at midnight (12–1 AM deviation +10.2 bpm, Z = 1.72) and elevated late afternoon/early evening deviations (e.g., 6–7 PM +20.8 bpm, Z = 1.44). The elevated cardiac activity around midnight paired with late habitual bedtimes suggests physiological arousal or activity near usual sleep onset, which can be congruent with delayed sleep timing or later sleep pressure. Several nocturnal hourly deviations have small positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., 3–4 AM r ≈ 0.23; 2–3 AM r ≈ 0.20), aligning with the notion that nocturnal physiological arousal and rhythm irregularity relate to worse reported sleep quality.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality: The participant demonstrates adequate average sleep duration and favorable psychological symptom levels, both factors that would tend to support relatively good PSQI scores. Countervailing evidence includes a late habitual bedtime (≈1:20 AM), above-average night-to-night variability in both sleep timing and duration, increased napping, and signs of reduced day-to-day circadian robustness and modest intraday fragmentation. These latter features are associated in the available correlations and the literature with poorer subjective sleep quality and greater daytime dysfunction. However, the magnitude of the unfavorable indicators is moderate rather than extreme (Z-scores for irregularity generally in the low-to-moderate range), and the participant’s low depression and anxiety, higher self-esteem, and normative overall sleep duration argue against severely poor global sleep quality.

PSQI group decision: Balancing the evidence, the profile most consistently points to overall sleep quality that is average-to-good rather than clearly poor. The largest strengths are adequate median sleep duration (Z = 0.54) and low affective symptomatology, while the principal risks for worse PSQI are late sleep timing and moderate irregularity. On balance these factors are more consistent with a PSQI in the lower half of the population distribution (i.e., relatively better/average sleep quality) than with the top half. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom 50% of PSQI scores.

74899,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant’s survey responses indicate elevated affective and stress-related symptomatology alongside modestly reduced self-regard. The CES-D score (17) falls above common screening thresholds and is classified in the dataset as “Depressed,” with a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49), indicating that greater depressive symptom burden is associated with poorer sleep in this sample. Trait anxiety (STAI = 52; Z ≈ 1.06) is also elevated and shows a moderate positive relationship to PSQI (r ≈ 0.40). Perceived stress is notably high (score = 30; Z ≈ 2.28), though its correlation with PSQI in the sample is smaller (r ≈ 0.19). Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 32; Z ≈ -0.87) and correlates negatively with PSQI (r ≈ -0.35), consistent with links between lower self-esteem and worse sleep quality. Overall, the participant presents a cluster of elevated mood/anxiety/stress indicators that, given their effect sizes in this cohort, are likely to contribute to worse subjective sleep quality.

Sleep behavior and wearable-derived sleep metrics: Objective sleep from the wearable shows a median nightly sleep duration of about 5 hours 58 minutes (Z ≈ -1.52), indicating materially shorter sleep than the study average. The participant’s median sleep start time is late (approximately 02:25 AM) with moderate night-to-night timing variability (SD ≈ 65 minutes; Z ≈ -0.38). Nightly sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 84 minutes; Z ≈ -0.39) and absence of daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0; Z ≈ -0.86) suggest consolidated but consistently short nocturnal sleep. The short habitual sleep opportunity (under six hours on median nights) is a strong behavioral marker that typically maps onto elevated PSQI scores and daytime impairment in many cohorts.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology: Aggregate heart rate-derived circadian metrics show a mesor of ~80.9 bpm (Z ≈ 0.95) and amplitude of ~12.5 bpm (Z ≈ 0.54), with acrophase around 5:49 PM. Resting heart rate is modestly above the sample mean (62.1 bpm; Z ≈ 0.47). Nonparametric rhythm indices indicate modestly elevated intradaily variability (IV = 0.61; Z ≈ 0.46) and near-average interdaily stability (IS = 0.43; Z ≈ 0.17). The hourly mean deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal decline in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and pronounced positive deviations in late afternoon to early evening (peaking ~5–6 PM). Collectively, these features suggest a physiologic rest-activity/cardiac rhythm that retains a daytime/evening activity peak and nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence but with some within-day fragmentation (higher IV) that can be related to irregular arousal or activity episodes and that modestly associates with poorer sleep metrics in the sample.

Lifestyle and behavioral contributors: The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising alone three or more times weekly and other exercise/sports weekly), which is typically sleep-promoting. Alcohol use is present at a moderate level (beer 1–2 times/week), which may contribute to sleep fragmentation or reduced sleep quality despite no reported use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs. Social and recreational habits are moderate to low in duration (internet use 1–2 hours, socializing 1–2 hours, little TV/music/video gaming), and the participant reports relatively high health satisfaction and interpersonal trust. These behavioral factors provide some protective influence on sleep, but they do not offset the impact of chronic short sleep and elevated affective distress.

Integration and inference regarding PSQI placement: The most salient, high-impact indicators are the objectively short median sleep duration (≈6 hours, Z ≈ -1.52) and markedly late median sleep onset (~02:25 AM), combined with elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and perceived stress. Wearable-derived circadian metrics show some intraday fragmentation and a somewhat elevated mesor, which align with subjective reports that commonly co-occur with poorer sleep. Protective factors (regular exercise, lack of daytime napping, absence of recreational drug use, and relatively high health satisfaction/trust) temper risk but are unlikely to fully counterbalance the influence of short, late-night sleep plus affective distress on global sleep quality. Given the pattern and the known correlations in this sample (particularly the strong CES-D/PSQI and STAI/PSQI relationships), the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant’s sleep quality is more consistent with the upper half (worse sleep) of the study distribution.

35011,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Sleep timing and duration
The participant’s wearable-recorded sleep profile is characterized by relatively short and very late nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 5 minutes (Z = -1.37 versus the study sample), with a median sleep start time near 02:34 AM and a sleep-onset standard deviation of about 70 minutes. These features indicate a habitual delayed sleep schedule and modest night-to-night variability in sleep timing. Mean daily naps are essentially absent, so total daily sleep opportunity appears concentrated in a late, relatively brief nocturnal episode rather than distributed across the day.

Circadian organization and cardiovascular physiology
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate weak and flattened rhythmicity. Interdaily stability is low (0.17, Z = -1.98) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (0.13, Z = -1.62), suggesting limited day-to-day regularity of the participant’s activity/physiology rhythm across the recording period. Amplitude is markedly low (4.29, Z = -2.10) while mesor is elevated (86.7, Z = 1.74). Resting heart rate is high (77.6 bpm, Z = 2.31). Together, these values describe a relatively elevated baseline cardiovascular level with reduced peak-to-trough circadian variation. Intradaily variability is elevated (0.74, Z = 1.37), consistent with more fragmented within-day organization of activity/physiology. The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal depression in heart rate across the early morning hours (large negative deviations ~3–7 AM) and several daytime peaks (notably around mid-morning and early evening), which is consistent with a preserved but blunted day–night contrast superimposed on an elevated basal heart rate.

Behavioral and psychological context
Self-report data show elevated depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 20, Z ≈ 0.7, labeled “Depressed” in the survey) alongside lower-than-average perceived physical health satisfaction (score 1.89, Z = -1.78). Trait anxiety is not elevated (STAI = 36, Z = -0.52). The participant reports limited exercise (typically 1–2 times per month), modest alcohol use (beer/wine or liquor 1–2 times per week), minimal recreational drug use, and little daytime napping. Self-report measures of current happiness and self-esteem are not low relative to the sample (happiness Z = 0.55; self-esteem Z = 0.96), indicating mixed subjective well-being. The behavioral profile—late sleep timing, low exercise, and moderate alcohol use—plus elevated depressive symptoms and low health satisfaction provide contextual factors that commonly co-occur with reduced sleep quality.

Integration with PSQI-relevant indicators
Several objective and subjective indicators align with patterns associated with poorer sleep quality. Short nocturnal sleep duration and late sleep timing (median ~2:34 AM) are both linked to worse subjective sleep in prior work and show modest positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D correlates with PSQI at r ≈ 0.49). Reduced interdaily stability and low amplitude indicate irregular and blunted circadian structure, which often predicts fragmented sleep and poorer subjective sleep quality; intradaily variability is elevated, consistent with greater fragmentation. Elevated resting heart rate and elevated mesor further suggest higher basal physiological arousal, which can associate with sleep disturbances. Although some subjective indicators (lower stress score, moderate happiness, higher self-esteem Z) could temper concern, the preponderance of objective circadian dysregulation, late and shortened sleep, and elevated depressive symptoms point toward relatively impaired sleep quality overall.

PSQI group judgment
Weighing the evidence — notably short median sleep (≈6h), very late sleep onset (≈2:34 AM), markedly reduced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, and elevated depressive symptom burden — the balance of objective and self-report indicators is consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality than the median participant in this study. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of PSQI scores (worse sleep quality) for the study population.

89710,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological profile and self-reported affect: The participant reports substantially elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 39, Z = 2.67; classification: ""Depressed"") and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = 1.35). These elevations are large relative to the study sample and are accompanied by low self-esteem (RSES Z = -1.85), low current happiness (Z = -1.61), and low satisfaction with physical health (Z = -1.7). These self-report indicators form a coherent pattern of increased negative affect and reduced positive self-appraisal that, in this sample, are moderately to strongly associated with poorer PSQI scores (CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI = 0.49 and 0.40 respectively). Taken together, the subjective symptom burden and affective profile provide substantial psychosocial risk factors for worse sleep quality.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns relevant to sleep: The participant reports relatively low frequency of solitary exercise (exercised alone 1–2 times/month, Z ≈ -0.43) with somewhat more frequent group exercise (1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.53). Recreational substance use is low overall (no beer, no recreational or non-prescribed drugs), with modest alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94). Daily leisure patterns indicate very high internet and music/listening time (both Z > 2.0), elevated video gaming (Z = 1.71), and limited sedentary hobby time. High late-evening screen and media exposure combined with limited regular exercise represents a behavioral milieu that tends to degrade sleep timing and subjective sleep quality in young adults.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological signals: Circadian regularity measures derived from heart rate indicate diminished day-to-day rhythm stability (interdaily stability = 0.22, Z = -1.56) and a modestly blunted rhythm amplitude (amplitude = 7.57, Z = -1.04). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (Z = -0.95), while intradaily variability is near the sample average (Z ≈ 0.03). Resting heart rate (58.2 bpm) and mesor are near-sample-average. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show robust nocturnal reductions in heart rate across early-morning hours (largest negative deviations around 3–6 AM) and a pronounced positive deviation in the early evening (notably 5–6 PM: +20.32, Z = 1.43). This pattern suggests a physiological profile with lower nocturnal cardiovascular activity (normal nocturnal dip) but a relatively elevated and concentrated evening arousal signal and reduced consistency of daily rhythms. Reduced interdaily stability and blunted amplitude together imply less-regular behavioral or physiological routines across days, a pattern that tends to correspond with poorer subjective sleep metrics.

Sleep timing and quantity from wearable data: Median nightly sleep duration is about 6 hours 44 minutes (Z = -0.56), which is modestly below sample average and below common recommendations for young adults. The participant's median sleep start time is late (approximately 01:25), and sleep start times vary considerably across nights (start-time SD = 133 minutes, Z = 1.09), indicating irregular and late sleep timing. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD ≈ 102 minutes). Mean daily naps are infrequent. The combination of late habitual sleep timing, substantial variability in sleep onset, and slightly reduced total sleep time is typically associated with subjective sleep disturbances and higher PSQI scores.

Evidence supporting better/average PSQI (bottom 50): Some wearable features are near-average or in direction of preserved sleep physiology — resting heart rate and mesor are close to the sample mean, intradaily variability is not elevated, and nocturnal heart rate reductions are present (expected during sleep). Mean nightly sleep duration is not severely curtailed (near 6.7 hours), and daytime napping is minimal, which could mitigate very poor PSQI in some contexts. Correlations between several wearable circadian metrics and PSQI in the sample are small, so by themselves these physiological measures do not strongly predict extreme PSQI scores.

Evidence supporting poorer PSQI (top 50): Multiple strong indicators favor a higher/worse PSQI. The participant's depressive and anxiety symptoms are substantially elevated and these scales show moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), making affective symptom burden a primary driver of likely poor sleep quality. Behavioral risk factors for poor sleep are present (high late-evening screen/media exposure, low regular exercise, some evening alcohol use). Objectively, sleep timing is late and irregular (median start ~01:25 and high start-time variability), and sleep duration is modestly short; both timing irregularity and shortened/variable sleep duration show positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset. Reduced interdaily stability and blunted circadian amplitude further align with patterns previously associated with poorer subjective sleep.

Holistic assessment and PSQI group assignment: Integrating subjective symptom severity, behavioral patterns, and wearable-derived sleep/circadian metrics yields convergent evidence for worse-than-average sleep quality. The large effect sizes of depressive symptoms and anxiety, coupled with late and inconsistent sleep timing and high evening arousal signals, outweigh the few near-average physiological metrics. Therefore the balance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of the PSQI distribution in this study population.

Scores on the CES-D are substantially above the cohort mean (score = 33; Z = 2.05) and the STAI–Trait score is moderately elevated (47; Z = 0.56), while self-reported stress is very high (score = 32; Z = 2.83). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are below average (RSES Z = -0.31; happiness Z = -1.61). These trait and state measures together indicate a profile of increased negative affect and stress during the recording period. Behavioral indices show low substance use, frequent solo exercise, limited sedentary hobby time, and a high amount of listening-to-music time — a pattern consistent with some adaptive health behaviors co-occurring with elevated internalizing symptom burden.

Objective sleep timing and quantity: Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 8 hours 10 minutes (Z = 1.22), with relatively low night-to-night variability in total sleep time (SD ≈ 60 minutes; Z = -0.92) and few naps. Sleep onset is typically late, with a median sleep start time near 00:31 and a moderate sleep start time variability (SD ≈ 90 minutes; Z = 0.15). In isolation, the aggregate sleep duration and low nap frequency would be consistent with adequate sleep opportunity; however, the late and somewhat variable bedtimes suggest a delayed sleep timing that could affect subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning for some individuals.

Circadian and physiological patterns: Heart-rate-based circadian features show modestly reduced interdaily stability (0.39; Z = -0.16) and elevated intradaily variability (0.66; Z = 0.81), indicating that the participant’s hour-to-hour activity/arousal pattern is somewhat fragmented across the day despite having a clear daily peak in the late afternoon (acrophase ≈ 4:14 PM). Resting heart rate and MESOR are modestly higher than the cohort mean (resting HR 63.6 bpm, Z = 0.65; MESOR 77.8, Z = 0.53). Hourly deviations from mesor show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate suppression (strong negative deviations overnight, particularly 4–6 AM) and marked positive deviations during early evening hours (5–7 PM). Together these findings suggest generally intact circadian amplitude but less stable day-to-day rhythm and relatively elevated physiological arousal overall.

Integration and likely impact on subjective sleep quality (PSQI): Objective sleep quantity is above the cohort average, but several converging indicators favor poorer subjective sleep quality. Elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are strongly associated with worse PSQI in this sample (CES-D correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.49; STAI correlation ≈ 0.40), and this participant’s affective burden is high. The combination of late sleep timing, increased intradaily variability (fragmentation of daily rhythm), modestly elevated resting HR, and high stress increases the likelihood of sleep complaints (e.g., perceived poor sleep quality, longer latency, nighttime awakenings, or daytime dysfunction) despite objectively adequate total sleep time. Sleep-duration metrics here show little direct association with PSQI in the cohort, whereas affective measures and rhythm irregularity are more predictive of higher PSQI scores; that pattern aligns with the participant’s profile.

Overall assessment regarding PSQI distribution: Balancing objective and subjective indicators, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant is likely to report relatively poor sleep quality compared with the study population. High depressive symptoms and stress, along with circadian fragmentation and elevated physiological arousal, outweigh the objectively long median sleep duration when predicting PSQI-defined sleep problems. Therefore the participant most likely falls in the top half of the cohort distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively poorer sleep quality).

Academic performance is strong (GPAs near the top of the scale). These self-report features point toward limited mood- or stress-related contributions to sleep disturbance for this participant.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a physiologically rested profile with some evidence of daily timing irregularity. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.3 bpm, Z = -0.70), and the overall mesor is modestly below the population mean (Mesor = 70.97, Z = -0.41), consistent with good baseline cardiovascular recovery. Circadian amplitude is slightly above average (Amplitude = 11.51, Z = 0.24), and interdaily stability is near the population mean (0.43, Z = 0.17), but the 24‑hour autocorrelation is low (0.20, Z = -1.03), which suggests weaker day‑to‑day regularity in the heart rate rhythm across the recording period. Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show expected nocturnal nadirs (large negative deviations overnight) and pronounced daytime increases, with especially large morning and evening deviations (e.g., 8–9 am and 7–8 pm). Taken together, the physiology suggests generally good recovery overnight with some behavioral or schedule-driven variability across days.

Objective sleep statistics from the wearable show relatively long total sleep time but some variability and compensatory napping. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 8 minutes (Z = 1.18), placing the participant well above the study mean for duration. Median sleep start is shortly after midnight (00:05), and sleep‑onset timing variability is moderate (SD ~74 minutes, Z = -0.19). Nightly duration variability is elevated but not extreme (SD = 108 minutes, Z = 0.16). Mean daily naps occur at a higher-than-average frequency (0.18 naps/day, Z = 1.27). This combination—late but long nocturnal sleep with a notable nap frequency and modest day‑to‑day variability—can reflect either a healthy extended sleep opportunity or a schedule in which naps and shifts in timing compensate for occasional short or late nights. The wearable–PSQI correlations provided are small and do not point strongly toward one direction; however, frequent naps and lower circadian autocorrelation can be associated with less consolidated sleep and modest decrements in perceived sleep continuity.

Integrative interpretation and PSQI group assessment: most evidence favors relatively good or at least average overall sleep quality. Objective total sleep duration is substantially above average and physiological indicators of overnight recovery (low resting heart rate, overnight heart-rate nadir) are consistent with restorative sleep. Self‑report affective measures do not suggest substantial mood‑related sleep impairment. Countervailing signals—greater nap frequency, reduced 24‑hour autocorrelation (less consistent daily rhythm), and moderate variability of nightly duration—could contribute to intermittent sleep consolidation issues, but these are smaller in magnitude than the positive indicators. Given the balance of wearable and survey evidence, the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., lower/average PSQI scores corresponding to relatively better sleep quality).

Self-esteem is slightly above average (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17 relative to scale direction) and self-rated health satisfaction and happiness are positive (health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.8; happiness Z ≈ 0.55). Lifestyle behaviors include regular physical activity (exercise alone three+ times per week, Z = 1.07), minimal recreational drug use, no napping, and modest weekly alcohol use (beer and wine 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 1.0). Taken together, the profile indicates moderate psychosocial stress and anxiety symptoms but also engagement in protective health behaviors (regular exercise, low napping, no drug use) and generally favorable self-rated health.

Sleep timing, duration, and regularity (self-report + wearable):
Objectively recorded sleep quantity and stability are relatively favorable. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 27 minutes (Z = 0.33), and night-to-night sleep duration variability is low (SD = 64 minutes, Z = -0.84). The participant does not habitually nap (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Sleep onset timing is late (median start ≈ 01:18 AM) but also consistent (sleep start SD = 36 minutes, Z = -1.02), indicating a stable late-night schedule rather than erratic sleep timing. These wearable-derived indicators (adequate median duration, low variability, consistent bedtime) generally align with behaviors that support consolidated nocturnal sleep, despite the late clock hour of sleep onset.

Circadian and physiological signals:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a robust day–night contrast without evidence of fragmentation. Mesor and resting heart rate are lower than typical for this population (Mesor = 60.85, Z = -1.79; resting HR = 47.2, Z = -1.30), which is consistent with relatively high cardiovascular fitness and may reflect regular exercise. Amplitude is near population average (Z ≈ 0.15) and intradaily variability is typical (Z ≈ -0.04), while interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are slightly below average (Z ≈ -0.33 and -0.53), suggesting some loss of stronger day-to-day regularity in circadian heart-rate patterns but not marked fragmentation. Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal decreases in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~1–7 AM) and clear daytime peaks (notably around 10–11 AM), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and active daytime physiology.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI):
Multiple objective indicators favor relatively good or average sleep quality: sufficient median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, absence of naps, and clear diurnal heart-rate separation. Psychological factors that are moderately elevated and that correlate with worse PSQI scores in the cohort (trait anxiety and perceived stress) could exert some influence on subjective sleep quality (PSQI components such as sleep latency or disturbances), but their magnitudes are modest and are counterbalanced by protective behaviors (regular exercise, stable bedtimes). The participant’s late but consistent sleep timing may affect subjective perceptions of sleep depending on social or academic demands, but by wearable metrics the sleep episode is of adequate length and stability. Considering the combination of objective wearable markers, behavioral supports (exercise, no napping), and only modest psychosocial risk, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality) rather than the upper half.

The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercising and sports three times per week or more, positive Z-scores), minimal recreational drug use, and modest weekly alcohol consumption.

Taken together, total time asleep is near the sample average but bedtimes are delayed and somewhat inconsistent—features that can produce subjective complaints or daytime consequences even when total sleep time is close to normative values.

Circadian and cardiac physiology: Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively low mesor and resting heart rate (Mesor ≈ 60.1 bpm, Z ≈ -1.9; resting HR ≈ 41.1 bpm, Z ≈ -2.03), consistent with a high baseline cardiovascular fitness profile. Non-parametric circadian measures point toward reduced day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability Z ≈ -0.74) and elevated within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ 1.23). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines and an afternoon–evening activity peak (acrophase ≈ 4:57 PM), with larger-than-average evening heart-rate elevations (e.g., 6–9pm Z-scores >1) and strong overnight reductions (early morning negative deviations with Z-scores below −1 at some hours). Physiologically, this pattern suggests a robust sleep-related drop in cardiovascular arousal but a circadian organization that is somewhat irregular across days and shows pronounced evening arousal—an arrangement that can be concordant with delayed or variable sleep schedules.

Integration and implications for sleep quality: Several aspects of the multimodal data point toward generally favorable influences on sleep (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, frequent exercise, near-normal sleep duration), whereas other signals could contribute to reduced subjective sleep quality (late and moderately variable bedtimes, elevated intradaily variability and reduced interdaily stability of heart-rate rhythms). The objective sleep duration is close to the sample median, and night-to-night variability in duration is modest; these findings weigh toward average or better sleep quality. Although the wearable circadian fragmentation (intradaily variability) and delayed bedtime pattern are potential risk factors for poorer PSQI scores, the participant’s favorable psychological profile and high physical fitness (very low resting HR) are stronger and more consistently linked with better subjective sleep in this dataset (noting CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI are among the strongest reported). Correlations between the wearable circadian indices and PSQI in this sample are small or null, suggesting the physiological irregularities observed here are less predictive of PSQI than the psychological measures for this cohort.

Overall PSQI group classification: Balancing the evidence—near-average total sleep time, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, regular exercise, and modest variability in sleep duration versus late sleep timing and some circadian instability—the preponderance of indicators supports that the participant’s global sleep quality would fall in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., comparatively good/average sleep quality rather than poor). Therefore the participant is more likely to be in the bottom 50% of PSQI scores (lower/median PSQI).

77872,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive and trait anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 11, z = -0.24; STAI = 33, z = -0.82), relatively high self-esteem (RSES z = 0.82), above-average health satisfaction (5.56 on a 1–7 scale, z = 0.97), and modest perceived stress (score = 21, z = -0.17). Recreational drug use is absent and exercise is limited but present (exercising alone and with others 1–2 times/week). Alcohol use (beer 1–2 times/week, z = 1.01) is higher than many peers. Overall, self-report data indicate a generally adaptive psychological profile with some lifestyle factors (late-evening alcohol, limited exercise frequency) that can interact with sleep timing and quality.

Wearable circadian and cardiac signatures: Cosinor-derived and nonparametric circadian metrics indicate a relatively well-structured diurnal rhythm: interdaily stability is near average (0.40, z ≈ -0.08) and intradaily variability is low (0.36, z = -1.31), consistent with limited fragmentation of activity/heart-rate patterns day-to-day. Mesor and amplitude are modestly above the cohort mean (mesor 78.7 bpm, z = 0.65; amplitude 13.1, z = 0.75), with an acrophase around 5:58 PM (early evening peak). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced elevations in the late evening and around midnight (11–12 pm: +15.9, z = 1.85; 12–1 am: +9.6, z = 1.63) alongside the expected nocturnal trough across the early morning hours (e.g., 5–6 am: -21.2). The elevated late-evening and midnight heart-rate deviations suggest physiological arousal or activity near habitual sleep onset rather than a quiescent pre-sleep profile.

Objective sleep behavior and timing: Fitbit-derived sleep summaries show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 50 minutes (z = -0.44), slightly shorter than the study mean, with low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 64 minutes, z = -0.84). Mean daily naps are effectively zero (z = -0.86). However, the participant’s median sleep start time is very late (approximately 01:58 AM) with a moderate standard deviation in start time (~82 minutes, z ≈ -0.02). That combination—habitually late sleep timing with only modestly curtailed total sleep and low variability—indicates a stable but delayed sleep schedule.

Synthesis and PSQI implication: The data present a mixed pattern. Favorable signals for better or average PSQI include low fragmentation (low intradaily variability), consistent sleep timing across days (low variability in duration), absence of naps, and generally low self-reported mood disturbance. Conversely, several features are associated with poorer sleep quality: habitual late sleep onset (~2:00 AM), slightly short median sleep duration relative to the cohort, elevated late-evening/midnight heart-rate deviations (markers consistent with pre-sleep physiological arousal or late activity), and above-average weekly alcohol use. Correlations provided in the dataset show that nocturnal heart-rate elevations and depressive/anxiety symptoms are positively associated with worse PSQI in the sample, although this participant’s mood scores are low. On balance, the combination of very late sleep timing and physiological signs of evening arousal—both established contributors to poorer subjective sleep quality—outweigh the protective signals of rhythm regularity. Therefore the overall evidence is more consistent with this participant having a PSQI in the worse half of the cohort distribution.

72348,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"The wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate objectively favorable nocturnal behavior. Median nightly sleep duration was 8 hours 22 minutes (Z = 1.48), with low night-to-night variability (SD = 39 minutes; Z = -1.4), a consistent median sleep onset time near 23:45 with little variability (SD 26 minutes; Z = -1.24), and no recorded naps. These features together—long average sleep, low variability in both duration and timing, and absence of daytime napping—are conventionally associated with consolidated sleep and lower likelihood of sleep complaints attributable to irregular schedules or insufficient total sleep.

Circadian and aggregated heart-rate metrics corroborate a well-entrained daily rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.65; Z = 1.99) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.62; Z = 2.49) are high, and intradaily variability is relatively low (0.43; Z = -0.81), indicating a consistent day-to-day structure and limited within-day fragmentation of heart-rate rhythms. The cosinor-derived mesor and amplitude show a clear daytime elevation and nighttime trough: hourly deviations from the mesor dip by approximately 14–18 bpm overnight and rise to peaks in the late morning (maximum ~+16.6 bpm around 9–10 AM). The acrophase (~3:25 PM) and the pattern of daytime increases support a stable, morning-active/afternoon-peaking circadian profile across the monitoring interval.

Physiological context and potential moderators of sleep quality are mixed. Resting heart rate and mesor are elevated relative to the study sample (resting HR 71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55; mesor Z = 1.69), which could reflect lower cardiovascular fitness, low BMI (BMI = 17.68), or transient autonomic arousal. Low levels of regular physical activity (exercise reported only 1–2 times a month) and a generally sedentary leisure profile (above-average internet and sedentary-hobby time) provide a plausible behavioral explanation for higher resting HR. However, the elevated resting HR in this case does not appear to be accompanied by circadian fragmentation or irregular sleep timing; the association between resting HR and PSQI in the sample is small (correlation ≈ 0.12), suggesting limited impact on perceived sleep quality for this individual.

Self-report psychological measures further support relatively good sleep-related functioning. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6; Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 39; Z = -0.23) are below or near sample averages, self-esteem is above average (RSES = 34; Z ≈ -0.59 in direction of higher self-worth), and stress is near the population mean. Substance use is effectively absent, and health satisfaction is slightly above average. Correlational guidance in the dataset indicates that lower depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with better PSQI outcomes; the participant’s low scores on these measures therefore point toward lower PSQI (better sleep quality) rather than poorer sleep.

Integrative assessment: multiple independent indicators—long and regular objective sleep duration, low variability in timing, strong interdaily stability and low intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythms, minimal napping, and low self-reported depressive/anxiety symptoms—converge on a profile consistent with relatively good sleep quality compared with the study population. The primary countervailing signals are an elevated resting heart rate and low habitual exercise, which may reflect fitness or metabolic factors but do not substantially detract from the constellation of sleep metrics that typically predict better PSQI scores. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports classification in the lower (better) half of the PSQI distribution.

89607,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The self-report data indicate elevated affective symptom burden relative to the study sample. The CES-D score of 24 (Z = 1.11; study classification: ""Depressed"") and STAI–Trait score of 49 (Z = 0.76; ""anxious"") place this participant above average for depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms. These two measures also show the relatively strong positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.4), which means higher mood/anxiety symptoms in this participant are a plausible contributor to worse subjective sleep quality. Other psychosocial measures are more mixed: self-esteem is slightly above average (RSES score 40, Z = 0.26) and general happiness is above average (Z ≈ 0.55), while reported stress is slightly lower than average (Z ≈ -0.44). Substance use is low for beer and recreational/non-prescribed drugs, with modest weekly wine consumption (1–2×/week, Z ≈ 0.94). The participant reports frequent exercise (three or more times weekly across solo and group exercise and sports; Zs > 1.0), which typically supports sleep health but does not necessarily offset the associations seen between mood/anxiety and poorer sleep.

Sleep habits and wearable-derived sleep metrics:
Wearable sleep statistics show a relatively long and consistent sleep duration alongside very late sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 12 minutes (Z = 1.26), and night-to-night duration variability is modest (SD = 65 minutes, Z = -0.81), indicating more total sleep and less variability than average in the cohort. Mean daily naps are infrequent but slightly above average (0.18 naps/day, Z = 1.27). In contrast, the median sleep start time is late (around 02:02 AM) but temporally consistent (start-time SD = 42 minutes, Z = -0.9). Taken together, the wearable data describe a stable, delayed sleep schedule with relatively long and regular consolidated nocturnal sleep. Correlations in the sample show only small associations between longer duration and PSQI (r ≈ 0.05) but modest positive associations between variability/napping and worse PSQI (r ≈ 0.17–0.20), which this participant largely does not exhibit given their low variability and low nap rate.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Heart-rate–derived circadian features indicate a relatively regular rhythm with somewhat elevated basal cardiovascular tone. Interdaily stability is high (0.56, Z = 1.24), indicating consistent day-to-day structure in heart rate patterns, and intradaily variability is lower than average (0.45, Z = -0.67), indicating limited fragmentation of the daily rhythm. MESOR and resting heart rate are elevated (MESOR = 80.34, Z = 0.87; resting HR = 68.6 bpm, Z = 1.24), while rhythm amplitude is modestly reduced (amplitude 9.67, Z = -0.36). The cosinor acrophase at ~5:14 PM and the hourly aggregate deviations show an expected daytime peak in heart rate (largest positive deviations ~12–15:00) and pronounced nocturnal troughs (large negative deviations across ~1–7 AM). The elevated resting heart rate and modestly blunted amplitude, together with elevated depressive/anxiety scores, suggest higher physiological arousal at baseline even though the participant’s daily heart-rate rhythm is regular and not highly fragmented. In the study correlations these cardiovascular and circadian features have only small associations with PSQI (e.g., resting HR r ≈ 0.12; amplitude r ≈ -0.11), so their contribution to subjective sleep quality is likely secondary to mood/anxiety signals.

Integrated interpretation and PSQI grouping:
There is a contrast in the data: objectively, the participant displays a stable circadian rhythm and relatively long, consistent nocturnal sleep, both features that often relate to better objective sleep health. However, the participant reports substantially elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms—measures that have among the strongest sample-level correlations with worse PSQI—and maintains a very late habitual sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:00 AM), which can negatively influence subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning despite adequate total sleep time. The combination of prominent mood/anxiety symptomatology (CES-D and STAI elevated), late sleep timing, and elevated resting heart rate (consistent with increased physiological arousal) weighs in favor of poorer subjective sleep quality as captured by PSQI domains (sleep quality, latency, disturbances, daytime dysfunction). Although objective wearable metrics argue against severe objective fragmentation or short sleep, the psychosocial risk factors most strongly tied to PSQI in this sample make it more likely this participant would score in the higher (worse) half of the PSQI distribution.

59900,14.0,0.9869109947643979,"Nightly sleep patterns derived from the wearable show a notably long central tendency in sleep duration but also substantial instability in timing. Median sleep duration was 9 hours 22 minutes (Z = 2.71), well above the study mean, while night-to-night variability in duration was large (SD = 169 minutes, Z = 1.55). Sleep onset was relatively late on average (median start ≈ 00:10) and the standard deviation of sleep start time was elevated (137 minutes, Z = 1.19). The participant reported no regular napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Together, these features indicate a pattern of long but irregular nocturnal sleep episodes rather than a consistent, consolidated sleep schedule.

Circadian and cardiovascular-derived rhythm metrics point to a dampened and less stable 24-hour organization of physiological arousal. Aggregate cosinor features show a modest mesor (71.11 bpm, Z = -0.39) and a relatively low amplitude (8.27, Z = -0.81), and nonparametric measures indicate reduced rhythm robustness (interdaily stability = 0.32, Z = -0.74; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.17, Z = -1.29). Hourly heart-rate deviations follow an expected diurnal shape — pronounced nocturnal declines (largest deviation ≈ -15 bpm around 6–7 AM) and elevated values in the afternoon/early evening (peaking ~+10 bpm around early afternoon). The combination of low amplitude and reduced day-to-day stability suggests that the participant’s physiological circadian signal is attenuated and somewhat irregular, consistent with large night-to-night variability in sleep timing.

Self-report measures and lifestyle indicators provide a mixed context for sleep. Depressive and trait-anxiety scores are near or below sample means (CES-D = 13, Z ≈ 0; STAI = 37, Z = -0.43), self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11), and reported stress is below average (score = 19, Z = -0.71). Health satisfaction is comparatively low (2.67 on a 1–7 scale, Z = -1.2). The participant reports moderate weekly alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ +1.0), minimal exercise engagement (exercise frequency Z-scores between -1.09 and -1.93), and limited sedentary recreational activities. These behavioral and affective data suggest generally favorable mood and low reported stress but limited physical activity and modest health satisfaction, which could interact with sleep timing and circadian regularity.

Integrative interpretation with regard to PSQI-relevant features: objective wearable metrics show hallmarks that are commonly associated with poorer global sleep quality — large variability in sleep timing and duration, late average sleep onset, and attenuated circadian amplitude and stability. Correlations provided with PSQI are small but point in expected directions (e.g., greater variability in duration and start time modestly associated with higher PSQI). Subjective mood and low stress scores argue against severe affective contributors to sleep disturbance, but low health satisfaction and limited exercise may contribute to less restorative sleep. The preponderance of evidence (marked oversleeping relative to peers combined with irregular timing and blunted circadian rhythm) favors an interpretation of relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the study population.

Based on the balance of objective and subjective indicators, the participant most likely falls in the higher half of the study distribution for PSQI (poorer sleep quality).

28254,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate a generally favorable psychological profile. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 32, Z = -0.92) are low relative to the study cohort, and self-esteem is at the high end (RSES = 40). Perceived stress and happiness are slightly below population mean in the expected directions but not markedly so (Stress Z = -0.71; Happy Z = -0.53). Health satisfaction is modestly above average (Z = 0.55). Weekly alcohol use is somewhat higher than the sample mean (beer and wine/liquor 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0), but recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Overall, trait-level risk factors that commonly co-occur with poor subjective sleep (depression, trait anxiety, high stress) are not prominent in this participant.

Sleep behavior and wearable sleep statistics: Nightly sleep duration is near the study mean but slightly lower (median 6 h 45 min; Z = -0.53). Sleep duration is relatively stable across nights (duration SD = 45 minutes; Z = -1.26), and the participant reports no habitual napping (Z = -0.86). However, sleep timing is somewhat late (median sleep start ≈ 00:50) and shows above-average variability (sleep start SD = 122 minutes; Z = 0.86), indicating inconsistent bedtimes despite fairly consistent total sleep time. These timing irregularities (late and variable sleep onsets) are clinically relevant for sleep consolidation and circadian alignment even when total sleep time is not severely reduced.

Circadian rhythm and autonomic physiology: Heart-rate–derived circadian features point to a relatively attenuated and less regular circadian profile. Interdaily stability is low (0.28; Z = -1.07), amplitude is reduced (8.37; Z = -0.78), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is below average (Z = -0.61), together indicating weaker day-to-day regularity and a lower-magnitude diurnal heart rate rhythm. Resting heart rate is modestly elevated relative to the sample (61.9 bpm; Z = 0.45). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal negative deviations and daytime positive deviations, but several early-morning hours (e.g., 2–6 am) display less pronounced nocturnal dipping relative to the population (positive Z-scores for those negative deviations), consistent with a blunted nocturnal autonomic decline. Daytime peaks are concentrated in the early-to-mid afternoon (acrophase ~1:27 PM), but the overall lower amplitude and reduced interdaily stability suggest reduced circadian robustness.

Integration and interpretation for sleep quality: The dataset presents mixed signals. Protective features that generally predict better subjective sleep quality are present: low depressive and anxiety symptoms (strongest survey correlates with PSQI in this cohort), reasonable total sleep duration close to the sample median, low variability in sleep duration, absence of naps, and generally positive self-reported health and self-esteem. Countervailing indicators that typically associate with poorer sleep include late and inconsistent sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability, a modestly elevated resting heart rate, and evidence of a blunted nocturnal heart-rate dip in the early morning. The survey predictors that most strongly correlate with PSQI in this population (depressive and anxiety symptomatology) are low for this participant, which weighs substantially toward better subjective sleep. The wearable-derived circadian irregularities and blunted nocturnal autonomic decline are moderate risk signals but have weaker correlations with PSQI in the cohort than the psychological measures.

PSQI group estimate: weighing the evidence holistically — relatively low depressive and anxiety scores (stronger correlates of PSQI), near-average total sleep time with stable duration, and absence of naps favor placement in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (better or average sleep quality). Circadian irregularity and slightly blunted nocturnal physiology suggest some risk for reduced sleep quality but do not, in this case, outweigh the stronger protective psychological and sleep-duration signals. Therefore the participant is more consistent with the bottom 50% of the cohort on PSQI.

35347,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The self-report measures indicate a generally low affective symptom burden and relatively positive self-regard. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31) are below population means (Z-scores -0.34 and -1.02 respectively), suggesting limited mood- and anxiety-related sleep disruption. Self-esteem is relatively high (Z = 0.96) and perceived stress is near the sample average (Z ≈ 0.1). Social and recreational patterns show high weekday/weekend internet use and relatively large amounts of reading and socializing; exercise frequency is low. Substance use is occasional. These psychosocial features point toward internal resources that would typically support sleep quality (low mood/anxiety, higher self-esteem), while behavioral habits (high evening internet use, low exercise) are potential behavioral risk factors for delayed sleep timing or sleep latency.

Sleep timing and duration (wearable + self-report): Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of about 8 hours 29 minutes (Z = 1.61), indicating substantially longer sleep than typical in this sample. However, the median sleep start time is late (02:12), consistent with a delayed sleep schedule, and nightly duration shows notable variability (SD ≈ 146 minutes, Z = 1.04). The participant also records more frequent short naps (mean daily naps = 0.3, Z = 2.66). Taken together, these features describe a delayed, extended nocturnal sleep pattern with irregular total sleep time and compensatory daytime napping. Extended total sleep duration and low affective symptoms are favorable for several PSQI domains, but late bedtimes, greater duration variability, and daytime napping tend to be associated with worse subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction in this population.

Circadian and physiological indicators: Heart-rate-based circadian metrics indicate a reasonably structured rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.45, Z = 0.33) and intradaily variability (0.55, Z ≈ 0) are near or slightly above the sample mean, suggesting usable regularity in daily physiological patterns despite the late sleep schedule. Mesor and amplitude are modestly elevated relative to the sample (mesor Z = 0.43, amplitude Z = 0.63); acrophase around early evening (≈6:18 PM) and aggregated hourly deviations show the expected daytime elevations and strong negative deviations in the early morning hours (deep nadir across 3–7 AM). Resting heart rate is in the typical range for the sample (57.8 bpm). Overall, the circadian-heart-rate profile is coherent and shows robust daytime–nighttime separation, which argues against pervasive physiological sleep disruption.

Integration and likely PSQI position: Balancing the evidence, several relatively strong indicators point toward average-to-good overall sleep quality in the context of this sample. The participant’s objectively long median nightly sleep duration, low depressive and anxiety symptomatology, reasonable circadian regularity, and normal resting heart rate support a PSQI score in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., better or average sleep quality). Countervailing observations—pronounced evening/night timing (median sleep onset ~2:12 AM), elevated variability in total sleep time, and frequent napping—are risk factors that could elevate PSQI components related to sleep latency, daytime dysfunction, and perceived quality. However, those risk factors appear moderate relative to the stronger protective indicators. On balance, the pattern is more consistent with being in the bottom 50% of PSQI scores (relatively good/average sleep quality) rather than the top 50% (poorer sleep quality).

45641,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"The participant’s self-report profile indicates elevated affective symptom burden and limited health-promoting behaviors. The CES-D score of 22 (Z = 0.9; labeled “Depressed” in the dataset) and trait anxiety score of 46 (Z = 0.46) both sit above the study mean and are moderately correlated with worse PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40, respectively). Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) and overall health satisfaction is notably below the sample average (2.33 on a 1–7 scale, Z = -1.45). The participant reports very low frequencies of exercise and sports participation (exercise frequencies Z ≈ -1.18 to -0.88), minimal napping, and relatively high time spent in a sedentary hobby (Z = 2.01). These psychological and lifestyle features—higher depressive and anxious symptoms combined with low physical activity and low health satisfaction—are consistent with risk factors that, in this cohort, are associated with poorer subjective sleep quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics reveal a relatively stable, high-amplitude heart rate rhythm and typical resting heart rate. Nonparametric stability (interdaily stability = 0.58, Z = 1.41) and cosinor-derived amplitude (13.3, Z = 0.81) indicate a well-structured daily rhythm across the recording period. Mesor (80.02, Z = 0.83) and resting heart rate (63.2 bpm, Z = 0.6) are modestly above sample means. These objective rhythm measures usually align with more regular sleep–wake organization and, in this sample, are weakly associated with better PSQI (amplitude r ≈ -0.11; interdaily stability r ≈ -0.07), suggesting that the participant’s physiology does not show pronounced fragmentation or irregularity that would strongly predict very poor objective sleep continuity.

Nightly sleep patterns present a mixed picture: median sleep duration is relatively long (7 h 54 min, Z = 0.89) and sleep timing variability is modest (sleep start SD ≈ 50 minutes, Z = -0.73), and the participant reports essentially no naps (Z = -0.86). These indicators point to sufficient aggregate sleep opportunity and consistent timing. However, the median sleep start time is late (approximately 01:59:30), and aggregate hourly heart rate deviations show a positive deviation around midnight (12–1 am: +8.13 bpm, Z = 1.42) with large negative deviations across the usual overnight period—suggesting a phase-delayed schedule with elevated physiological arousal near the typical sleep onset window. Late sleep timing and elevated pre-sleep arousal are both features that can increase sleep latency and subjective disturbances even when total sleep time is adequate.

Integrating subjective symptom burden with objective physiology and sleep timing yields a weighted interpretation favoring relatively poorer overall sleep quality. The participant combines elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (stronger known correlates of worse PSQI in this sample) with late sleep timing and signs of pre-sleep physiological arousal, despite having reasonably long sleep duration and a stable circadian rhythm. On balance, the pattern is more consistent with higher PSQI scores (poorer subjective sleep) than with low/average scores in this study population. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the distribution for PSQI (worse sleep quality).

Self-reported indicators that tend to covary with better sleep—higher self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.54) and greater interpersonal trust (Z = 0.83)—are elevated in this participant. Substance use is essentially absent (alcohol and recreational drug use all reported as “not at all,” Z-scores strongly negative), and physical activity is present at a modest level (exercise and sports reported 1–2 times/week, sports Z = 0.91). Taken together, the survey data indicate a psychological and lifestyle profile that, on balance, is associated with lower likelihood of clinically relevant mood or anxiety disturbance and contains factors that typically support sleep continuity and quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular profile: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a generally robust and regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is high (0.61, Z = 1.66), intradaily variability is not elevated (0.53, Z = -0.11), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is positive (0.37, Z = 0.39), indicating consistent day-to-day structure in cardiac activity. The participant’s mesor and resting heart rate are both low relative to the study sample (Mesor 67.23, Z = -0.92; Resting HR 50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93), which commonly reflects good cardiovascular conditioning and lower tonic physiological arousal. Cosinor amplitude is modestly higher than average (Amplitude Z = 0.49) and acrophase around late afternoon (4:57 PM), consistent with a typical diurnal peak. Aggregated hourly deviations show a pronounced nocturnal heart rate reduction (max dip ~-24 to -25 bpm overnight) and marked relative elevations across late afternoon and evening hours (notably 8–10 PM with large positive Z-scores). The nocturnal dip and overall rhythm regularity suggest intact circadian down-regulation at night, while the evening elevations indicate higher relative physiological activation in the hours before reported sleep onset.

Sleep behavior and wearable sleep statistics: Objective sleep duration is slightly shorter than the population average (median sleep 6 h 38 min, Z = -0.69) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 96 minutes, Z ≈ -0.1). Median sleep start time is shortly after midnight (~00:42), with a relatively stable bedtime across nights (start-time SD 55 minutes, Z = -0.61). Napping is effectively absent (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). These sleep metrics describe a pattern of generally consistent timing and consolidated nocturnal sleep but with a habitual sleep period that is somewhat brief relative to the sample mean. The combination of consistent timing, lack of daytime napping, and a preserved nocturnal heart-rate decline supports adequate sleep architecture and sleep drive, while the slightly reduced total sleep time is a potential source of suboptimal sleep quantity.

Synthesis and implication for PSQI placement: Multiple convergent indicators favor relatively good sleep quality. Low symptom burden (depression and anxiety), limited substance use, regular daily structure (high interdaily stability), low resting heart rate, stable bedtimes, and absence of naps are all features that typically correlate with lower PSQI (better sleep). Correlations provided in the dataset show that depressive and anxiety symptoms covary positively with PSQI; given this participant’s low scores on those measures, the probabilistic prediction is toward lower PSQI. Counterbalancing signals are modest: median nightly sleep duration is somewhat reduced (~6.6 hours) and evening heart-rate elevations could reflect higher pre-sleep physiological activation in some evenings, both of which can contribute to worse subjective sleep. However, the magnitude of these risk indicators is small relative to the number and strength of protective features (psychological health, circadian regularity, low RHR, consistent sleep timing).

Overall judgment: on balance, the evidence supports that this participant’s global sleep quality, as indexed by PSQI-related correlates and wearable-derived rhythm metrics, would be more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality rather than poor). Consequently, the participant is most consistent with the bottom 50% of PSQI scores in this sample.

28312,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Wearable-derived sleep and circadian features indicate a relatively stable and consolidated physiological sleep pattern across the recording period. The participant’s median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 35 minutes (Z = 0.51), which is above the study median and is generally consistent with sufficient nightly sleep. Nocturnal cardiovascular physiology shows a pronounced night-time trough (heart-rate deviations from mesor reaching about −23 bpm in the 4–5 AM window) and a strong daytime peak (largest positive deviation +21.9 bpm at 5–6 PM), producing a large cosinor amplitude (15.54, Z = 1.54) and an elevated mesor (83.44, Z = 1.3). Autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (Z = 0.9) and interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.45, Z = 0.33). Together these metrics reflect a robust, regular circadian rhythm and substantial day–night separation in physiological arousal—features that, in the cohort-level correlations reported here, are modestly associated with better (lower) PSQI scores.

Behavioral and self-report context shows a mix of protective and risk-related influences on sleep. The participant reports a relatively late habitual sleep start time (median start ~01:23 AM) but with low night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 58 minutes, Z = −0.54). Daytime napping is minimal (mean naps ≈ 0.08/day). Alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor) at about 1–2 times per week is above the cohort mean (Z ≈ 1.0), while exercise and sports participation are low (exercise roughly 1–2 times per month; sports not at all). Psychological trait measures show elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66) and modestly elevated perceived stress (score = 23, Z = 0.38). Depressive symptoms are near the cohort average (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07), and global self-esteem is somewhat below average (RSES Z = −0.45). Self-reported happiness is above average (Z = 0.55). These behavioral and psychological features have mixed directional associations with PSQI in the cohort (e.g., anxiety and depressive symptom correlations with PSQI are positive, while circadian amplitude and happiness are negatively correlated).

Integrated interpretation with respect to PSQI domains: objectively, duration, regularity, and circadian robustness point toward relatively adequate sleep continuity and consolidation (likely favorable scores on PSQI components related to duration and habitual sleep efficiency). The late habitual sleep timing could contribute to longer sleep latency or impaired daytime functioning for some schedules, and the weekly alcohol use and elevated trait anxiety/stress could worsen subjective sleep quality, latency, or disturbances—domains captured by the PSQI that are sensitive to psychological state. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 123 minutes, Z = 0.51) is somewhat elevated and cohort correlations suggest greater variability is associated with higher PSQI, which introduces a countervailing factor. Overall, the objective physiology and total sleep time are stronger and clearer signals in this dataset than the moderate psychological risk markers.

Conclusion regarding PSQI placement: weighing the relatively robust circadian rhythm, above-average total sleep time, low napping, and strong day–night heart rate separation against moderate trait anxiety, some weekly alcohol use, and moderate duration variability, the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant’s overall sleep quality is more consistent with the lower half (better/average PSQI scores) of the study population distribution. The wearable and sleep-duration indicators carry substantial weight relative to the modest self-report risk factors, so the most likely PSQI grouping is bottom_50.

56805,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Psychological and lifestyle profile: The participant’s self-report measures indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and favorable psychosocial functioning. Scores on the CES-D (very low, Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI, Z = -2.11) are well below the sample mean, and self-esteem and current happiness are elevated (self-esteem Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64). Health satisfaction is high (Z = 2.05). Substance use is minimal across categories and the participant reports frequent exercise and sports participation (exercise and sports Z-scores positive), suggesting regular physical activity and generally health-promoting lifestyle habits. Taken together, these survey indicators point toward psychological and behavioral resources that typically protect against poor subjective sleep quality.

Wearable-derived cardiovascular and circadian features: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a low overall mesor and resting heart rate (mesor Z = -1.3; resting HR Z = -1.66), consistent with relatively low baseline cardiovascular tone (often seen with higher fitness). Amplitude is close to the sample mean (Z ≈ 0), and the population-level acrophase around mid-afternoon (≈ 3:10 PM) indicates a daytime peak in heart rate typical of diurnal activity. Non-parametric rhythm metrics indicate modestly reduced day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.30, Z = -0.9) and near-average intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability Z ≈ -0.04). Aggregate hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~1–5 AM) and elevated daytime values mid- to late-morning, reflecting a normally phased but somewhat attenuated circadian profile with weaker interdaily coupling.

Objective sleep behavior from wearables: The most salient wearable sleep metric is a short median nightly sleep duration of approximately 5 hours 33 minutes (Z = -2.02), substantially below the study mean. Median sleep onset is late (about 01:20 AM), with moderate night-to-night consistency in start times (sleep start SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z ≈ -0.63) and relatively low day-to-day nap behavior. Sleep duration variability is not elevated (SD ≈ 75 minutes, Z ≈ -0.59), indicating the participant’s short sleep is a consistent pattern rather than extreme night-to-night fluctuation.

Integrated interpretation relevant to PSQI: Several protective factors from self-report—low depressive symptoms and anxiety, high self-esteem, regular exercise, minimal substance use, and high health satisfaction—would be expected to associate with better subjective sleep quality and lower PSQI scores. However, objective sleep metrics point in the opposite direction: habitual short duration (≈5.5 hours) and late sleep timing are both strong contributors to poorer global PSQI scores because duration and sleep timing map onto PSQI components for sleep duration, latency/efficiency, and daytime dysfunction. Circadian metrics showing reduced interdaily stability further suggest a mildly irregular daily structure that can exacerbate sleep complaints. The PSGI-correlations provided show moderate positive associations between depressive symptoms and PSQI, but here depression/anxiety are low; nonetheless, the magnitude of the participant’s objective short sleep (Z ≈ -2.0) is a dominant risk factor for elevated PSQI relative to the sample.

Conclusion on PSQI group placement: Balancing the available evidence, the participant displays strong psychosocial and lifestyle resources that typically protect sleep, but they have a pronounced and consistent objective sleep deficit and late habitual sleep timing—factors that directly increase PSQI component scores. Given the substantial deviation of sleep duration from the sample mean (Z ≈ -2.0) and the late sleep onset, the overall pattern is more consistent with relatively poorer global sleep quality compared with peers. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the study distribution (worse PSQI).

26800,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and modest trait anxiety (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13), with self-esteem and academic performance elevated relative to the sample (self‑esteem Z = 0.96; GPAs ≈ 3.8–3.9). Reported stress and health satisfaction are near or slightly below the cohort mean (stress Z ≈ -0.17; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.2). Alcohol use is higher than many peers (beer and wine/liquor use Z ≈ +1.0), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Overall, affective and functional indicators (low depressive symptoms, reasonable anxiety, high self‑esteem, strong GPAs) point toward generally adaptive psychological functioning that would tend to support adequate sleep quality.

Circadian and physiological patterns (wearable-derived):
Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate relatively weak day-to-day rhythm strength and amplitude. Interdaily stability is low (0.30, Z = -0.9) and amplitude is reduced (8.0, Z = -0.9), while mesor and resting heart rate are below the cohort mean (mesor 67.3, Z = -0.91; resting HR 49.4 bpm, Z = -1.04), consistent with good baseline cardiovascular fitness but attenuated circadian cardiac variation. Aggregated hourly deviations show large overnight heart-rate troughs (e.g., -15 to -22 bpm between ~3–6 AM) and pronounced positive deviations in the late morning (peaks at 9–11 AM, Zs up to +2.2), which is consistent with consolidated nighttime physiological rest and strong daytime activation. The pattern suggests preserved nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation but reduced regularity of daily timing across days.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Objective sleep duration is within a typical range (median 7 h 14 min, Z = +0.06) and napping is minimal (mean daily naps 0.07, Z ≈ 0). Sleep timing is relatively late (median sleep start ≈ 01:28 AM) and night-to-night timing variability is moderate (sleep start SD ≈ 89 minutes, Z ≈ +0.13). Sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 94 minutes, Z ≈ -0.15) is not markedly elevated relative to the cohort. Together, these features indicate that while total nightly sleep quantity is adequate on average, the participant tends to sleep late and has modest irregularity in the timing of sleep episodes across the semester.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality:
Weighing the streams of evidence, multiple signals support relatively good-to-average sleep quality. Objective total sleep time is in the normative range and nocturnal cardiac downregulation is robust, both factors associated with adequate restorative sleep. Psychological indicators (low depressive symptoms, modest anxiety, high self-esteem, low reported stress) would also be expected to favor better subjective sleep. Countervailing factors include a late habitual sleep onset (~1:30 AM) and reduced interdaily stability of physiological rhythms, which can increase vulnerability to perceived or objective sleep difficulties. On balance, the preponderance of objective sleep quantity, physiological evidence of nocturnal rest, and favorable psychological profile indicate that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good or average sleep) rather than the top half (poorer sleep).

47142,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 19; Z = 0.59) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43; Z = 0.17). Self-esteem, happiness, trust, and health satisfaction are below the study mean (self-esteem Z = -0.45; happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -0.95; trust Z = -0.46). Activity patterns indicate minimal social or team activities, limited exercise (1–2x/week alone), and effectively no substance use. Together these features describe a pattern of subclinical mood burden, reduced subjective well-being, and relatively low social engagement—factors that are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality in student samples.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability: Wearable-derived sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 32 minutes (Z = -0.81), indicating habitual sleep that is shorter than the sample mean. The median sleep start time is late (01:39 AM), with moderate night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 69 minutes; Z ≈ -0.31) and in sleep duration (SD ≈ 87 minutes; Z ≈ -0.32). Napping is relatively frequent (mean daily naps = 0.3; Z = 2.66), which may reflect compensation for curtailed nocturnal sleep or daytime sleepiness. These objective sleep habit indicators (shorter-than-average nocturnal sleep, late sleep timing, and elevated nap frequency) align with behavioral patterns that often contribute to or reflect compromised sleep quality.

Circadian and physiological signals: Heart rate–based circadian metrics show a relatively structured and stable rhythm: interdaily stability is elevated (0.54; Z = 1.08) and autocorrelation at 24 h is high (0.50; Z = 1.48), while intradaily variability is low (0.36; Z = -1.31). Cosinor MESOR is elevated (83.6; Z = 1.32) and resting heart rate is somewhat higher than average (65.1 bpm; Z = 0.83). The aggregated hourly deviations show expected nocturnal heart rate suppression (largest negative deviations ~ -22 bpm around 4–5 AM) and daytime elevations with a peak in the late afternoon/evening (acrophase ≈ 5:06 PM). The combination of strong interdaily consistency and low intraday fragmentation suggests preserved circadian organization of activity/physiology despite late sleep timing; however, the elevated MESOR and resting heart rate may indicate higher overall autonomic arousal relative to peers.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality: Several converging indicators point toward relatively poorer sleep quality. Short nocturnal sleep (≈6.5 hours) and a late median sleep onset (≈1:40 AM), together with unusually frequent naps (Z = 2.66), are behavioral patterns associated with greater sleep complaints and daytime impairment. Mood-related self-report (CES-D and STAI elevations) provides additional risk for worse subjective sleep; these measures also show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40). Counterbalancing evidence includes robust circadian regularity (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability and high 24-hour autocorrelation), which is generally protective for consolidated sleep. Overall, the combination of late/short nocturnal sleep, high nap frequency, and elevated affective symptoms outweighs the protective signal of circadian regularity for predicting subjective sleep problems.

PSQI group judgment: Considering the balance of objective sleep restrictions and timing, elevated nap behavior, and elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms—alongside only modestly protective circadian regularity—the overall profile is more consistent with higher PSQI scores (worse sleep) relative to the study population. I therefore place this participant in the higher PSQI group (top 50th percentile).

60396,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report measures present a mixed but overall favorable psychosocial profile with some specific risk features. Depressive symptom burden is low (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55), and subjective happiness and health satisfaction are above average (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.88), both of which are features that typically associate with better sleep. Trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 42, Z = 0.07) and is the clearest psychological risk factor here given its positive correlation with worse PSQI scores; this suggests a moderate tendency toward anxiety-proneness that could selectively affect sleep initiation or subjective sleep quality. Self-esteem is lower than the study mean (RSES Z = -0.73), which, in combination with the anxiety score, creates some psychosocial vulnerability for disturbed sleep. Substance use and recreational behaviors are moderate to low (alcohol 1–2×/week; no recreational or non-prescribed drug use) and organized social/exercise activities are relatively frequent, particularly exercising with others (Z = 1.23), factors that often support routine and recovery.

Objective sleep behavior and timing:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate generally adequate and regular sleep quantity with a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 23 minutes (Z = 0.26) and relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 70 minutes, Z = -0.69). Napping is infrequent (mean daily naps = 0.07). The participant’s typical sleep onset is relatively late (median sleep start ~01:46), but onset timing itself is consistent across nights (sleep start SD = 53 minutes, Z = -0.66). From a behavioral-sleep perspective, the combination of sufficient total sleep time, low variability in both duration and start time, and minimal daytime napping suggests consolidated nocturnal sleep and stable sleep opportunity that are usually associated with more favorable PSQI component scores for duration and regularity despite a late chronotype.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Circadian features derived from heart-rate indicate a pronounced and regular 24-hour structure. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is notably high (Z = 1.57), intradaily variability is low (Z = -1.45), and interdaily stability is near the sample mean (Z = -0.24); collectively these metrics indicate low fragmentation and a consistent daily rhythm. The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and evening peaks (largest positive deviations ~7–9 PM), with acrophase at 5:52 PM and a modest amplitude (Z = -0.20). Resting heart rate and MESOR are both below the population mean (RHR = 49.4 bpm, MESOR Z ≈ -1.1), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low baseline arousal. The pattern—stable daily rhythm, low intraday fragmentation, and healthy RHR—favors objective sleep consolidation and generally corresponds to lower PSQI scores in population-level associations.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
When integrating subjective and objective evidence, the participant shows several features associated with relatively good sleep quality: adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, rare napping, stable circadian rhythm metrics, and healthy resting heart rate. Offsetting these positive indicators are a late habitual sleep onset time, a modestly elevated trait anxiety score (which correlates moderately with worse PSQI), and lower self-esteem. Depressive symptoms are low, and overall lifestyle factors (regular exercise with others, moderate alcohol use, low recreational drug exposure) are not strongly indicative of poor sleep. Given the relative strengths of the objective sleep and circadian measures and the low depressive symptom burden, the balance of evidence favors relatively good to average sleep quality overall, with the anxiety/self-esteem profile representing the primary psychological contributor to potential subjective sleep complaints rather than pervasive objective disturbance.

Overall PSQI group judgment:
Considering the multimodal evidence—sleep duration slightly above average, low variability in sleep timing and duration, strong circadian regularity, low depressive symptoms, and only modest elevations in trait anxiety—the participant is more consistent with having a PSQI score in the lower or middle range of the study distribution (i.e., better or average sleep quality). Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom 50% of PSQI scores (relatively good/average sleep quality).

Self-esteem and momentary happiness are above average (RSES Z = 0.82; Current Happiness Z = 1.64), and perceived stress is well below the sample mean (Stress Z = -1.53). Health satisfaction is also somewhat higher than average (Z = 0.63). These self-report indices, which generally correlate with PSQI in the expected directions (depression and anxiety positively correlated with worse PSQI; self-esteem and happiness negatively correlated), collectively point toward psychological conditions that favor better subjective sleep quality.

Behavioral and lifestyle indicators: The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs) and regular physical activity (exercising alone and with others three times per week or more; exercise-related Z-scores ~1.1–1.2). Daily recreational screen and socializing times are low compared with the sample. Mean daily naps are zero (Z = -0.86). This pattern—low substance exposure, regular exercise, and limited evening recreational screen/social time—is consistent with behavioral contributors to relatively stable and restorative sleep.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular profile: Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate a relatively preserved day–night structure. Mesor (67.4 bpm) and resting heart rate (53 bpm) are lower than the population mean (mesor Z = -0.89; resting HR Z = -0.61), suggesting relatively good cardiovascular fitness or lower baseline arousal. Amplitude is moderately elevated (13.1, Z = 0.74), indicating a meaningful diurnal swing in heart rate. Non-parametric measures show modest interdaily stability (0.43, Z = 0.17) and somewhat elevated intradaily variability (0.66, Z = 0.81); the latter suggests some within-day fragmentation of activity or arousal but is only modest in magnitude. Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions (roughly -18 to -20 bpm between 2:00–7:00 AM) and large positive deviations in the late-afternoon/early-evening window (notably ~39 bpm at 5–6 PM, Z = 4.19, and 25 bpm at 6–7 PM, Z = 2.17). The evening HR elevations likely reflect periods of higher activity (e.g., exercise) rather than nocturnal dysfunction; correlations of these hourly deviations with PSQI are small and mixed.

Objective sleep statistics and regularity: Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 7 h 48 min (Z = 0.76), with a relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 62 minutes, Z = -0.87) and moderately consistent sleep onset times (median start 00:54, SD = 49 minutes, Z = -0.74). The participant reported no regular naps. These objective features—sleep duration in the upper half of the sample, low variability, and consistent bedtimes—are typically associated with better PSQI scores. The start time near 00:54 is later than typical daytime schedules but is stable, and there is no wearable evidence of pervasive nocturnal arousal; overnight HR reductions are robust.

Integrated interpretation and PSQI ranking: Multiple independent lines of evidence point toward relatively good sleep quality. Psychological indicators (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem), health behaviors (no substance use, regular exercise, no naps), objective sleep metrics (median duration ~7 h 48 m, low variability, consistent bedtimes), and wearable circadian signals (robust nocturnal HR decline, moderate amplitude, low resting HR) converge in favor of lower PSQI scores. Areas that could modestly detract—later habitual sleep onset (~00:54) and slightly elevated intradaily variability—are limited in magnitude and are not accompanied by other signs of poor sleep (e.g., short duration, frequent naps, elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms). On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the study distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively good/average sleep quality).

Reported stress is modestly below the sample mean (Z = -0.44). These self-report measures are relevant because depressive and anxiety symptoms in this dataset correlate positively with worse PSQI scores (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40) while higher self-esteem and happiness correlate with better PSQI (r ≈ -0.35 and -0.27, respectively). The participant’s lifestyle shows regular exercise (≥ three times/week, Z > 1), limited recreational drug use, and modest alcohol use (beer/wine 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1). Overall, the self-report and behavioral profile are consistent with psychological and lifestyle factors that typically support better subjective sleep quality.

Sleep behavior and sleep-wake timing: Wearable-measured median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 36 minutes (Z = 0.52), which is above the study average and would generally support good sleep quality. The participant takes essentially no daily naps (mean naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). However, sleep timing is late on average (median sleep start ≈ 01:27 AM) and both sleep onset time and total sleep duration show elevated night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 114 min, Z = 0.69; sleep duration SD ≈ 145 min, Z = 1.0). Variability metrics have modest positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18), indicating that the participant’s irregular sleep timing and variable duration are plausible contributors to worse subjective sleep quality despite an adequate average total sleep time.

Circadian and physiological profile from wearable data: Heart-rate derived circadian metrics show a reasonably pronounced diurnal amplitude (amplitude = 13.83, Z = 0.99) and a mesor near the sample mean (MESOR ≈ 73.3, Z = -0.08). Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56), which is physiologically consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and generally favorable restorative physiology. Non-parametric circadian features reveal higher intradaily variability (IV = 0.72, Z = 1.23), suggesting greater fragmentation in activity/rest transitions across the day, while interdaily stability is slightly below average (IS = 0.39, Z = -0.16). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir in heart rate (large negative deviations during ~2–7 AM) and pronounced afternoon elevations (largest positive deviations 3–5 PM, Z > 2), with a modestly elevated heart-rate deviation near midnight (12–1 AM value positive, Z ≈ 1.03). The pattern of elevated intradaily variability and modestly reduced interdaily stability aligns with the actigraphic indicators of irregular sleep timing and may be linked to subjective sleep disturbance; IV and measures of timing variability have small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality: Synthesizing modalities, the participant presents a mixed-but-leaning-positive profile for PSQI-relevant factors. Objective and subjective indicators of overall sleep quantity and restorative physiology are favorable (median sleep >7.5 h, low nap use, low resting HR, positive self-rated health and mood), and psychological symptoms that strongly predict worse PSQI are minimal. Countervailing evidence includes relatively late habitual sleep timing and above-average night-to-night variability in both sleep onset and total sleep time, together with elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate-derived activity rhythms; these irregularity measures correlate modestly with worse PSQI in the study. Given the magnitude and direction of effects across domains, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to have PSQI values in the lower half of the sample distribution (i.e., relatively better sleep quality), with residual risk from timing variability that could modestly elevate a PSQI score but is unlikely, in isolation, to push the participant into the top half of the population’s (worse) PSQI distribution.

86440,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report profile indicates generally low symptom burden and positive well-being relative to the study sample. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) are below the population mean, and perceived stress is relatively low (Stress score Z = -0.71). Self-esteem is high (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17) and happiness and interpersonal trust are above average (Happy Z = 0.55; Trust Z = 0.50). Substance use is reported as absent across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs (Z-scores range approximately -0.11 to -1.30). These self-report indicators generally align with factors that are associated with better subjective sleep in the literature and in the study correlations (CES-D and STAI show moderate positive correlations with PSQI, while self-esteem and happiness show negative correlations), suggesting psychological functioning that would tend to support relatively good sleep quality.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns:
Daily habits reflect moderate social and screen time but limited napping and generally low nocturnal sleep disruption behaviors. The participant reports minimal daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86) and limited alcohol/drug use. Recreational activity is modest: sports participation is somewhat above average (sports frequency Z = 0.91) while solo exercise frequency is low (Z ≈ -1.18). Typical leisure activities (internet use, socializing, light media) are in the small-to-moderate range. These behavioral patterns (low substance use, low naps, some regular sporting activity) are consistent with routines that favor consolidated nighttime sleep and fewer sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of about 7 hours and 1 minute (Z = -0.21), with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 94 minutes, Z = -0.15). Median sleep start time is approximately 00:50 with relatively low variability in sleep start (SD = 51 minutes, Z = -0.70), indicating a reasonably consistent bed-time relative to the sample. Resting heart rate is relatively low (51 bpm, Z = -0.85) and the cosinor MESOR is below the sample mean (MESOR = 64.7, Z = -1.27), both consistent with lower overall cardiac arousal/resting physiology. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations in early morning hours) and a pronounced daytime peak in the early-to-mid afternoon (2–3 pm deviation +13.7, Z = 1.22), suggesting regular daytime activity and typical diurnal cardiovascular modulation.

Circadian regularity metrics are broadly near sample average with modest departures: interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.39, Z = -0.16) and intradaily variability is near average (0.56, Z = 0.10). Amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is somewhat reduced (amplitude Z = -0.60). These features suggest the participant has a recognizable day–night rhythm with modestly attenuated amplitude and only small reductions in day-to-day regularity; the pattern does not indicate major circadian disruption.

Integrative sleep-specific interpretation:
Taken together, subjective and objective indicators point toward generally adequate and relatively regular sleep. Objective sleep duration is close to 7 hours and shows low nap frequency; sleep onset timing is moderately consistent (late evening but stable). Psychological factors that typically worsen sleep (elevated depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol/drug use) are largely absent or below average for this participant. Some circadian metrics (reduced amplitude, slightly below-average interdaily stability) mildly favor more fragmented or lower-quality sleep, but their effect sizes are small. Correlations reported in the dataset indicate that the strongest predictors of worse PSQI in this sample are depressive and anxiety symptoms (moderate positive correlations), and the participant’s scores on those measures are low. Other wearable correlates (sleep variability, sleep start variability, amplitude) show small associations with PSQI; the participant’s values on those are either near-average or modestly favorable (e.g., low start-time variability, low nap rate).

PSQI group assessment:
Evidence supporting relatively good or average PSQI (lower PSQI scores, bottom 50th percentile): median sleep duration near 7 hours (Z = -0.21), low nap frequency (Z = -0.86), consistent sleep start time (start-time SD Z = -0.70), low depressive and anxiety symptomatology (CES-D and STAI Z-scores slightly below average), low stress (Z = -0.71), and minimal substance use. These features are associated with lower PSQI in the dataset and in general sleep research.

Evidence supporting relatively poor PSQI (higher PSQI scores, top 50th percentile): slightly reduced circadian amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.60) and a small reduction in interdaily stability (Z = -0.16), which are associated with somewhat worse sleep in the dataset but have modest correlations with PSQI. Night-to-night sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 94 minutes) is not elevated relative to the sample (Z = -0.15), so it does not support poorer PSQI.

Holistic conclusion:
Overall, the balance of psychological, behavioral, and wearable-derived evidence favors relatively good or average sleep quality compared with the study population. The participant’s protective factors (low depression/anxiety/stress, stable bedtimes, minimal naps and substance use, and typical nightly sleep duration) outweigh the small signals of reduced circadian amplitude. On balance, these data are most consistent with a PSQI score in the lower half of the study distribution.

29792,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Behavioral and self-report profile: The participant reports a mix of generally positive well-being indicators (Rosenberg self-esteem at the upper end of the scale, health satisfaction and happiness modestly above sample mean) together with modest elevations in trait anxiety (STAI score 43, Z = 0.17) and regular alcohol use (beer use “three times a week or more,” Z = 1.72). Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 13) are near the sample mean and are not classified as depressed in the provided interpretation. Recreational and computer-based leisure (video games, TV/videos) are relatively frequent (video games Z = 1.71; TV/videos Z = 1.28) and exercise with others is high (Z = 1.23). Taken together, the self-report profile suggests a socially active student with some evening-oriented leisure and alcohol use and a modest elevation in trait anxiety—factors that can influence sleep timing and subjective sleep experience.

Wearable-derived sleep behavior: Nightly sleep estimates show a median sleep duration of about 6 hours 11 minutes (Z = -1.25), with a standard deviation of duration of approximately 107 minutes (Z = 0.15). The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (about 04:31 AM), with a moderate night-to-night start-time variability (SD ≈ 66 minutes, Z = -0.37). Napping is effectively absent (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Short median sleep duration combined with an extreme late sleep onset indicates a delayed sleep schedule and reduced total nocturnal opportunity, which are commonly associated with worse subjective sleep quality and daytime impairment even when fragmented or variable sleep is not extreme. The modest variability in sleep start time and duration suggests some consistency in the delayed schedule, but the timing itself is substantially shifted relative to typical student schedules.

Circadian and cardiovascular signatures: Cosinor and nonparametric circadian metrics show a mixed picture. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.46, Z = 0.42) and intradaily variability is slightly below average (0.50, Z = -0.32), indicating some structure to daily heart-rate rhythms and relatively low fragmentation during the day. However, autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.19, Z = -1.12), implying weaker day-to-day recurrence of the same hourly profile. The MESOR and resting heart rate are lower than sample mean (MESOR 69.94 bpm Z = -0.55; resting HR 52 bpm Z = -0.73), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low overall tonic arousal. Hourly mean deviations from the mesor show elevated evening heart rates (e.g., 7–8 pm Z = 2.12) and positive deviations in late night/early morning hours around midnight–1am (12–1am Z = 1.56), with subsequent reductions into morning hours. These hourly patterns, together with the late sleep onset, suggest an evening activity/arousal profile (physiological peaks in the later evening) and circadian timing shifted later than average.

Integration and implications for sleep quality: Key objective indicators that typically associate with poorer sleep quality are present: substantially delayed sleep timing (median start ~4:32 AM), median total nocturnal sleep below typical recommendations (≈6 h 11 m, Z = -1.25), and frequent evening leisure and alcohol use (beer use Z = 1.72; high video-game/TV use). Trait anxiety is slightly elevated (STAI Z = 0.17), and depressive symptoms are near average but correlate with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49), which increases the chance of higher subjective sleep complaints when symptoms fluctuate. Countervailing evidence includes moderate interdaily stability and low intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythms, absence of daytime napping, and low resting heart rate—features that can mitigate some aspects of sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. Nevertheless, the combination of late timing and reduced sleep duration is a strong indicator of circadian misalignment and restricted sleep opportunity, both of which tend to increase PSQI scores (worse sleep quality) across student samples.

Overall PSQI group assignment: Balancing objective wearable metrics, timing behavior, substance and evening leisure patterns, and the self-report trait profile, the preponderance of evidence points toward relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the study population median. The late sleep onset (4:31 AM) and shortened median sleep duration (≈6 h 11 m, Z = -1.25), together with frequent evening alcohol and electronic-media use, are especially persuasive indicators that this participant’s PSQI score would fall in the upper half of the sample distribution (i.e., higher/worse PSQI scores).

14737,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Objective wearable data and self-report converge on a pattern of relatively short, late, and variable nocturnal sleep. The participant’s median Fitbit-recorded sleep duration was 6 hours 3 minutes (Z = -1.41), indicating substantially shorter nighttime sleep than the study mean. Bedtime timing is late (median sleep start ~01:47) and temporally inconsistent (sleep start SD = 135 minutes, Z = 1.14), and night-to-night sleep duration variability is elevated (SD = 133 minutes, Z = 0.74). These features—short median sleep, late average sleep onset, and elevated intra-individual variability—are commonly associated with diminished subjective sleep quality and daytime impairment even when some objective sleep continuity metrics are not available.

Psychological and lifestyle variables provide mixed but relevant context. The participant reports modest depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 14; classified here as “not depressed” but correlated with poorer sleep in the sample, CES-D–PSQI r = 0.49) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 45; STAI–PSQI r = 0.40), both of which are correlated with worse PSQI scores in the study. Self-esteem is somewhat below average (Rosenberg Z = -0.59) while self-reported stress is lower than average (Stress Z = -0.44) and happiness is above average (Happy Z = 0.55). Health behaviors include minimal substance use and almost no team-based exercise; exercise alone is reported only 1–2 times per month and overall sedentary hobby time is relatively high (sedentary hobby Z = 1.41). Low substance use and low napping slightly mitigate risk, but limited exercise, a sedentary lifestyle, and the presence of anxiety-related traits support the plausibility of sleep disturbance.

Physiological and circadian metrics indicate generally intact circadian structure but with greater intraday fragmentation. Cosinor-derived features show a normative mesor (74.34 bpm, Z = 0.05) and moderate amplitude (12.42 bpm, Z = 0.53) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (4:54 PM). Interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.45, Z = 0.33) indicating some day-to-day regularity, but intradaily variability is elevated (0.64, Z = 0.67), suggesting more frequent transitions between activity/rest states within days. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.2 bpm, Z = -0.47), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal decreases relative to the mesor between ~2:00–6:00 AM (deviations -19 to -26 bpm) and modest elevations in the early evening (6–7 PM deviation +22 bpm, Z = 1.65), consistent with consolidated low physiological arousal during the typical sleep window but also an evening period of high arousal. The elevated intradaily variability and the late/variable sleep timing together point to circadian misalignment or irregular behavioral scheduling despite preserved overall rhythm amplitude.

Integrative interpretation and PSQI ranking. Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality: objectively short median sleep (≈6 h), late and irregular sleep timing, elevated night-to-night variability, higher intradaily variability in circadian measures, and the presence of trait anxiety and modest depressive symptoms—both of which in this sample correlate with poorer PSQI—support a PSQI that is worse than average. Evidence consistent with better or average sleep quality is limited (low substance use, low napping, normative mesor and amplitude, and relatively low resting heart rate). Balancing these factors, the preponderance of indicators associated with worse subjective sleep (short, late, and irregular sleep plus anxiety/depressive symptom correlates) suggests this participant’s PSQI would fall in the upper half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively poorer sleep quality).

28653,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Psychological and behavioral self-report: The participant reports low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76; STAI = 29, Z = -1.22), along with relatively high self-reported happiness, trust, health satisfaction, and self-esteem (happiness Z = 1.64; trust Z = 1.79; health satisfaction Z = 1.63; self-esteem Z = 1.52). Substance use is minimal and exercise frequency is above average (exercising with others Z = 1.23), while sedentary recreational activities are limited. These survey-derived features collectively indicate a psychological and lifestyle profile that is broadly favorable for sleep: low affective symptom burden, engagement in social exercise, little recreational substance use, and high perceived health and well-being. Several of these measures (depression, anxiety, self-esteem) have known, nontrivial correlations with PSQI in the population, and here the participant’s scores are positioned toward the more adaptive end of those distributions.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a robust, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.58, Z = 1.41) and intradaily variability is low (0.25, Z = -2.08), with a strong 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.40). Amplitude of the rhythm is high (17.77, Z = 2.26) and the mesor and resting heart rate are near or below population mean (mesor Z = 0.05; resting HR 53 bpm, Z = -0.61). Aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nighttime reductions in heart rate (very negative deviations between ~12–6 AM) and substantial daytime elevations centered in the mid-afternoon (largest positive deviation ~3–4 PM). Taken together, these features indicate a consolidated day–night organization of physiological arousal with low fragmentation and strong day-to-day regularity—patterns that are typically associated with better objective and subjective sleep quality.

Sleep timing and duration metrics: Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate relatively long and consistent sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 8 hours 4 minutes (Z = 1.10), above the study mean, with sleep-duration variability near the population average (SD ~100 minutes, Z ≈ -0.03). Median sleep onset is just after midnight (00:16), and night-to-night variability in sleep start time is modestly elevated (SD ≈ 107 minutes, Z = 0.53). Napping is absent (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Longer than average sleep duration combined with minimal napping and low sleep fragmentation implied by circadian metrics suggests consolidated nocturnal sleep quantity and timing; the modest variability in sleep onset is the main circadian/timing factor that could slightly reduce sleep regularity but is not extreme.

Evidence synthesis for PSQI placement: Multiple lines of evidence point toward relatively good sleep quality in this participant. Objective wearable indicators show a strong, regular circadian pattern (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high amplitude) and pronounced nocturnal cardiovascular down-regulation—both consistent with consolidated, restorative sleep. Objective sleep duration is longer than the cohort average and naps are absent. Self-report measures indicate low depressive and anxiety symptoms and high well-being, which are associated with fewer subjective sleep complaints. Countervailing signals are limited: bedtime is somewhat late (median ~00:16) and night-to-night sleep-start variability is modestly elevated, but these are moderate in magnitude and correlations with PSQI in the dataset are small. Balancing the stronger, consistent set of favorable indicators against the relatively minor timing variability, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower (better) half of the PSQI distribution.

95559,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and self-report context: The participant reports low-to-moderate levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55; STAI-Trait = 29, Z = -1.22) and relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.96). Self-reported stress and current happiness are slightly below sample means (Stress Z = -0.44; Happy Z = -0.53), and perceived health satisfaction is modestly lower than average (Z = -0.53). Academically and socially the participant reports typical levels of activity (GPA around 3.0; socializing ~1–2 hours/day). These self-report indicators point to generally low affective symptom burden and limited reported stressors, which are factors that typically support sleep quality.

Behavioral habits relevant to sleep: The participant has frequent alcohol consumption (beer three times a week or more, Z = 1.72; wine/liquor 1–2 times weekly, Z = 0.94) and elevated evening leisure (listening to music 2–3 hours/day, Z = 1.13). Napping behavior is notable: mean daily naps = 0.25 with Z = 2.07, indicating substantially more naps than most peers. Exercise frequency is modest (exercise alone and with others 1–2 times/week). The combination of late-night leisure behavior, above-average alcohol use, and a high relative frequency of naps are behavioral features that can fragment nocturnal sleep or shift sleep timing and therefore increase the likelihood of subjective sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived circadian and autonomic profile: Heart-rate-based circadian metrics show a blunted and irregular rhythm. Amplitude is reduced (Amplitude Z = -1.16) and interdaily stability is low (0.17, Z = -1.98), indicating a relatively weak and inconsistent daily structure in cardiovascular activity across days. Intradaily variability is also lower than average (Z = -1.80), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is below average, all suggesting less robust day-to-day rhythmicity. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.1 bpm, Z = -0.48), consistent with aerobic fitness, but the heart rate hourly deviations show elevated mean values around midnight (12–1am deviation +4.6, Z = 0.92 and 11–12am +4.8, Z = 0.20) and a pronounced nocturnal drop during typical sleep hours. The pattern—elevated late-evening heart rate combined with blunted overall amplitude and low day-to-day stability—suggests an irregular schedule with possible late-evening physiological arousal and a weakened circadian signal.

Sleep timing and quantity: Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate a late median sleep onset time (02:10 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD 88 minutes, Z = 0.12). Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 39 minutes (Z = -0.66), below sample mean but not extreme, and duration variability is moderate (SD 97 minutes). Frequent napping (Z = 2.07) together with the late bedtime suggests a tendency toward delayed sleep timing and compensatory daytime sleep, rather than uniformly short but regular nocturnal sleep. The late sleep timing and irregular schedules are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality even when total sleep time is near average.

Integrated assessment regarding PSQI: Protective indicators include low depressive and anxiety symptomatology and a relatively low resting heart rate, both of which tend to associate with better subjective sleep. Contrastingly, the participant exhibits several risk-relevant features for poorer sleep quality: a notably late median sleep start (≈2:10 AM), high relative frequency of naps (Z = 2.07), elevated alcohol use (beer Z = 1.72), and wearable-derived evidence of a blunted and less stable circadian rhythm (interdaily stability Z ≈ -1.98, amplitude Z ≈ -1.16). Several wearable-derived nocturnal heart-rate features (e.g., modestly elevated pre-midnight HR deviations) and the behavioral profile favor intermittent or perceived sleep disruption. On balance, the pattern of late timing, irregular day-to-day rhythm, frequent naps, and evening substance use weighs more strongly toward a higher likelihood of poorer sleep quality as measured by PSQI than the relatively low affective symptoms and adequate average sleep duration would mitigate.

Conclusion (PSQI group): Considering the combination of late and irregular sleep timing, high nap frequency, elevated alcohol use, and blunted circadian regularity—factors that commonly align with higher PSQI scores—I assign the participant to the group with relatively poorer sleep quality (top 50% of the population PSQI distribution).

30152,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports a modest level of affective disturbance characterized by low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 11; classified as not depressed, Z ≈ -0.24) but elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 41; Z ≈ -0.03, labeled “anxious”), increased perceived stress (Score = 24; Z = 0.65) and lower self-reported happiness (score = 3; Z ≈ -0.53). Self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 36; Z ≈ -0.31) and overall health satisfaction is elevated (6/7; Z = 1.3). Lifestyle behaviors that may influence sleep include regular solitary exercise (three times/week or more; Z = 1.07), minimal use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs, occasional wine consumption (1–2 times/week), and modest screen-based leisure (TV/videos 1–2 hours, internet 2–3 hours). Taken together, the psychological profile suggests modest affective strain driven primarily by stress and anxiety rather than depressive symptomatology; protective factors include regular exercise and high health satisfaction.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Wearable sleep statistics indicate a late habitual sleep onset and notable night-to-night irregularity. The median sleep start time is 02:28 AM, which is substantially later than typical collegiate circadian timing. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 48 minutes (Z ≈ -0.48), which is somewhat below recommended duration for young adults. Night-to-night variability is pronounced: sleep duration standard deviation = 118 minutes (Z ≈ 0.39) and sleep start time SD = 102 minutes (Z ≈ 0.41). Napping is minimal (mean daily naps 0.07). The combination of late average bedtimes and large variability in both sleep onset and duration are behavioral patterns that commonly reduce subjective and objective sleep quality; survey correlations provided (e.g., positive correlations of sleep variability measures with PSQI) are consistent with these factors being associated with worse reported sleep.

Circadian and cardiovascular signatures:
Heart-rate–derived circadian features show a relatively low mesor (mean heart rate ≈ 62.7 bpm, Z ≈ -1.54) and a low resting heart rate (49.4 bpm, Z ≈ -1.04), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness likely supported by regular exercise. The cosinor acrophase (approx. 5:17 PM) and the aggregated hourly deviations reveal a clear day–night separation: marked negative deviations during sleep hours (largest negative deviations ~ -16 bpm between ~3–6 AM) and pronounced positive deviations in the late afternoon (peaking ~4–5 PM with +24.6 bpm). Nonparametric rhythm metrics indicate reduced regularity across days (interdaily stability = 0.35; Z ≈ -0.49) and low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.15; Z ≈ -1.45), signaling inconsistent daily timing of physiological rhythms across the recording period. Intradaily variability is near the cohort average (0.54), suggesting that within-day fragmentation of the heart rate signal is not especially elevated. Overall, the physiology points to good fitness and a intact day–night amplitude of cardiovascular arousal but a relatively unstable circadian timing across days, which aligns with the late and irregular sleep schedule seen in the sleep statistics.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI):
Convergent evidence from subjective measures (elevated stress and trait anxiety, lower happiness), behavioral indices (late median bedtime, suboptimal median sleep duration, large night-to-night variability), and wearable circadian metrics (low interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation) point toward sleep that is more likely to be rated as poorer rather than better. Although protective signals exist (regular exercise, low napping, low substance use, and low resting heart rate suggesting good fitness), the factors most strongly associated with PSQI in the provided correlations (affective symptoms like depressive symptoms and anxiety, and variability in sleep timing/duration) are present to a meaningful degree. Taken holistically, this pattern more closely matches participants with higher (worse) PSQI scores in the study population.

59592,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports a modest depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 14; Z ≈ 0.07) but elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z ≈ 0.46) together with below-average self-esteem (RSES = 35; Z ≈ -0.45) and lower-than-average current happiness (3.0; Z ≈ -0.53). Perceived stress is mildly elevated (Score = 23; Z ≈ 0.38). Health satisfaction is below the study mean (Z ≈ -0.45). These self-report indicators form a coherent pattern of elevated anxiety and stress alongside reduced positive affect and self-regard; the anxiety measure in particular is a known correlate of poorer subjective sleep quality in this dataset (STAI–PSQI correlation ≈ 0.40). Substance use is limited overall (no recreational/non-prescribed drug use; beer infrequent), though wine consumption is relatively frequent for the sample (1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 0.94). Leisure time is skewed toward sedentary screen-based activities (watching videos and internet use elevated: Z ≈ 1.28 and Z ≈ 0.85 respectively), and organized physical activity is low.

Circadian and physiological patterns from wearables:
Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate reduced regularity and blunted daily structure. Interdaily stability is low (0.30; Z ≈ -0.90), suggesting weak day-to-day consistency in the heart rate rhythm. Intradaily variability is high (0.78; Z ≈ 1.65), indicating relatively greater fragmentation of activity/physiological states within days. The cosinor-derived amplitude is low (6.93; Z ≈ -1.25) despite a mesor modestly above the sample mean (Mesor = 77.31 bpm; Z ≈ 0.46); resting heart rate is also above average (66.1 bpm; Z ≈ 0.95). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–7:00 AM) and midday/evening elevations, indicating a physiological night-time trough but overall reduced amplitude. Together, these features suggest a circadian rhythm that is present but blunted and temporally inconsistent across days, which is commonly associated with impaired sleep continuity and subjective sleep complaints.

Sleep timing and duration:
Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is close to seven hours (6 h 57 m; Z ≈ -0.29), with moderate night-to-night variability in total sleep time (SD ≈ 93 minutes; Z ≈ -0.17). Napping is uncommon (mean daily naps ≈ 0.12; Z ≈ 0.61). The participant’s habitual sleep onset is late (median start time ≈ 01:49 AM) but relatively consistent (sleep start SD ≈ 39 minutes; Z ≈ -0.97), indicating a stable late-night schedule. The combination of near-7-hour nightly sleep and few naps indicates that total sleep opportunity is not grossly insufficient, but the late fixed bedtime reduces morning sleep opportunity and may misalign sleep with conventional daytime demands.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
There are competing signals for sleep quality. On one hand, total sleep duration approximates seven hours and sleep timing is consistent (low sleep-start variability), both of which tend to favor better sleep outcomes. On the other hand, elevated trait anxiety, higher resting heart rate and mesor, low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability point to physiological and behavioral irregularity and arousal that commonly contribute to worse subjective sleep quality and disturbed sleep continuity. In this sample, anxiety and depressive symptom measures show moderate positive correlations with PSQI (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), and several wearable circadian markers indicate blunting/fragmentation that often tracks with poorer PSQI scores. The participant’s late but regular bedtime may mitigate some effects of timing variability, but the broader pattern of autonomic arousal (higher resting HR), blunted amplitude, and day-to-day rhythm instability argues for greater subjective sleep disturbance than would be expected from duration alone.

Overall assessment relative to the study distribution:
Considering the balance of evidence — near-average sleep duration but late timing, consistent late-bed pattern, higher anxiety and stress, elevated resting heart rate and mesor, low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability — the preponderance of signals points toward relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the study population median. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the PSQI distribution (worse PSQI scores).

89652,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The self-report data show a relatively favorable affective profile alongside elevated perceived stress. Scores on depressive (CES-D = 5) and trait anxiety (STAI = 35) measures are below the population mean (Z-scores -0.86 and -0.62 respectively), suggesting few reported depressive or chronic anxiety symptoms during the assessment window. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are above average (RSES Z = 0.82; Happiness Z = 1.64), and interpersonal trust is markedly high (Trust Z = 2.75). At the same time, the participant reports higher-than-average stress (Stress score = 28, Z = 1.74). Lifestyle indices indicate minimal use of alcohol and recreational drugs, relatively low frequency of solitary or group exercise (1–2 times/month) but some engagement in sports (1–2 times/week), and low leisure screen-time. Taken together, these data describe an individual with generally positive self-evaluations and low affective symptom burden but with elevated subjective stress and modest physical activity.

Sleep timing and duration patterns (self-report and Fitbit): Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 34 minutes (Z = -0.76), which is shorter than the study mean and at the lower half of the distribution. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is high (standard deviation = 172 minutes, Z = 1.62), and sleep onset timing is very late on average (median start time ~02:54 AM) with moderate variability (start-time SD Z = 0.51). The participant takes occasional naps (mean daily naps 0.2, Z = 1.49). The combination of shorter-than-average median sleep, very late sleep timing, and large variability across nights is behaviorally consistent with irregular sleep opportunity and suggests increased risk for disrupted or inefficient sleep processes despite otherwise positive mood and self-regard.

Circadian and physiological features (wearable heart-rate metrics): Heart rate cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics portray a generally intact day–night amplitude but with signs of intra-day fragmentation. MESOR (~72.97 bpm) and amplitude (10.62 bpm) are near the cohort mean, and the acrophase is in the late afternoon (4:37 PM), consistent with a typical diurnal peak. Interdaily stability is near average (0.43, Z = 0.17), indicating some regularity across days, whereas intradaily variability is relatively elevated (0.73, Z = 1.30), reflecting more frequent transitions between activity and rest states within days. The 24-hour autocorrelation is lower than average (Z = -0.87), further suggesting less consistent daily structure. Hourly mean heart-rate deviations show the expected deep nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and a pronounced afternoon/evening rise (peak ~3–4 PM, Z = 1.61). Overall, these physiological profiles are compatible with preserved daytime cardiovascular responsivity but increased within-day fragmentation and reduced day-to-day rhythmic consistency, which often co-occur with irregular sleep timing.

Synthesis regarding sleep quality (PSQI) and ranking: Several convergent indicators point toward relatively poorer sleep quality in this participant. Key contributors are the late average sleep onset (~02:54 AM), shorter median sleep duration (6 h 34 m) relative to the study mean, and large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD 172 min). Wearable circadian metrics—elevated intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation—support the behavioral findings by indicating a fragmented activity/rest rhythm and reduced daily regularity. Although affective measures (low depression/anxiety, high happiness and self-esteem) mitigate some concerns, elevated perceived stress and the sleep-specific behavioral and physiological markers are more directly tied to PSQI-relevant domains (sleep efficiency, latency, disturbances, and daytime dysfunction). Correlational indicators in the dataset show modest positive associations of sleep variability and some nocturnal heart-rate deviations with PSQI, further aligning with the pattern of disturbed sleep. On balance, the preponderance of evidence—particularly late and irregular sleep timing combined with high variability and circadian fragmentation—indicates the participant is more likely to have a relatively higher (worse) PSQI score and therefore fall into the upper half of the study distribution.

28724,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant presents with a relatively adaptive psychological profile by several self-report indices. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76), trait anxiety is near the sample mean but modestly elevated relative to some peers (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13; instrument label “anxious” in the data), and self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11). Subjective well-being is notably positive (happiness current = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and perceived stress is below the sample mean (Stress score = 20, Z = -0.44). Health satisfaction is near average-to-better (score 4.0, Z = -0.20) and BMI is in the normal range (22.24). Together these survey indicators point toward generally favorable mood and adaptive behavior patterns that are commonly associated with healthier sleep functioning rather than severe sleep impairment.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns relevant to sleep:
Daily habits indicate consistent, health-oriented behaviors that typically support sleep regularity. The participant reports regular exercise alone multiple times per week (exercised alone ≥3×/week, Z = 1.07), low substance use (no beer or recreational/non-prescribed drug use; modest wine use 1–2×/week), minimal napping (mean daily naps = 0.07, Z ≈ 0), and moderate leisure/internet use in the evening. Academically and socially, the participant reports typical engagement (GPA high in available terms). These behavioral features—regular exercise, low daytime napping, and limited evening substance use—would be expected to contribute to relatively good nocturnal sleep quality and consolidation.

Wearable-derived sleep statistics and sleep timing:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate sleep duration and timing that are favorable in the study context. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 h 49 min (Z = 0.79), placing the participant above the sample median for total sleep time. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD = 65 minutes, Z = -0.81), and bedtime timing is tightly clustered around midnight (median sleep start ≈ 23:59, SD = 28 minutes, Z = -1.22). Low variability in both sleep duration and sleep onset time, combined with near-8-hour mean sleep, is consistent with consolidated sleep and fewer behavioral contributors to poor subjective sleep quality.

Circadian and heart rate-derived physiology:
Heart-rate-based circadian features present a mixed pattern. The cosinor-derived MESOR (70.7 bpm, Z = -0.45) and amplitude (9.0, Z = -0.57) are modestly below sample means, and interdaily stability (0.32, Z = -0.74) is reduced while intradaily variability is elevated (0.76, Z = 1.51). Elevated intradaily variability and lower interdaily stability indicate greater fragmentation of heart-rate activity patterns within days and weaker day-to-day rhythmic regularity, respectively. Aggregate hourly deviations from the mesor show clear nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and pronounced daytime peaks (notably around late morning and early afternoon; e.g., 1–2 PM deviation = +20.19, Z = 2.10). Resting heart rate is within a normal range (59.8 bpm, Z = 0.20). On balance, the heart-rate circadian profile suggests physiologically normal nocturnal lowering of cardiovascular activity but with relatively higher within-day fragmentation and somewhat attenuated rhythmic strength across days.

Integration and inference about sleep quality (PSQI distribution placement):
Most objective and subjective indicators converge on relatively good sleep quality. The participant’s sleep duration is longer than average for the cohort, bedtimes are consistent, and sleep duration variability is low—each of these features correlates with better PSQI-related outcomes and are present here. Self-report mood and behavior (low depressive symptoms, above-average happiness, regular exercise, minimal napping and substance use) further support an interpretation of comparatively good sleep. The principal countervailing signal is the heart-rate circadian profile: elevated intradaily variability and reduced interdaily stability indicate fragmentation of physiological rhythms, which can relate to poorer sleep in some contexts. However, the circadian metrics’ correlations with PSQI in the dataset are small, and the participant’s direct sleep metrics (duration and timing consistency) are robustly favorable. Considering the relative magnitudes of these signals, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the cohort PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good/average sleep quality).

69831,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral context: The participant reports relatively low affective symptom burden and stress across self-report instruments: CES-D = 10 (Z = -0.34, classified as not depressed), STAI-Trait = 38 (Z = -0.33, not anxious), and a self-esteem score near the upper range (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31). The self-reported stress metric is notably low relative to the sample (Z = -1.53). Together these survey results indicate limited current depressive or anxiety symptoms and lower perceived stress during the measurement period, which are factors that typically relate to more favorable subjective sleep. Contrasting this, health satisfaction is relatively low (score 2.67; Z = -1.2) and the participant reports minimal structured exercise (no regular alone or group exercise; Zs around -1.6 to -1.9), while engaging heavily in sedentary and evening recreational activities (watching videos, internet use, music listening, and socializing all high Z-scores). Alcohol use is present at a light-to-moderate frequency (beer and liquor 1–2 times/week). These behavioral patterns (late-evening screen time, low exercise, some alcohol use) can predispose to later sleep timing or degraded sleep quality, but their measured correlations with PSQI in this dataset are small.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological features: Heart-rate based circadian metrics indicate a reasonably coherent diurnal rhythm. Mesor (~71.7 bpm) and resting heart rate (56 bpm; Z = -0.26) are modestly lower than the sample mean, and the amplitude (11.4 bpm) is slightly above average (Z = 0.20), consistent with a measurable day–night difference in cardiovascular state. Non-parametric rhythm features show modest interdaily stability (0.38, Z = -0.24) and relatively low intradaily variability (0.44, Z = -0.74), implying somewhat consistent daily structure with limited within-day fragmentation. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show a clear nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations between ~1:00–6:00 AM, reaching ~-22 bpm around 4–5 AM) and elevated daytime values during mid- to late-afternoon and early evening. The pattern of a pronounced nocturnal heart rate nadir and low intradaily variability supports physiological consolidation of the sleep period rather than highly fragmented or aroused sleep across nights.

Objective and subjective sleep habits integration: Fitbit-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 8 hours (Z = 1.01), which is longer than the study average, with low mean daily naps (none) and low night-to-night variability in sleep start time (median sleep start ~01:35 AM; sleep start SD = 35 minutes, Z = -1.05). The combination of a long median sleep duration, consistent sleep-onset timing, minimal napping, and marked nocturnal heart-rate reduction indicates relatively stable and consolidated nocturnal sleep across the recording period. The principal countervailing factor is a consistently late bedtime (around 1:30 AM), likely reflecting evening social and media behaviors; late sleep timing can be associated with circadian misalignment or daytime impairment for people with early obligations. However, in this case the participant appears to compensate with a long sleep opportunity and stable scheduling, and wearable indicators do not show signs of frequent awakenings or physiological arousal during the night.

Holistic inference regarding PSQI placement: Multiple data streams converge on a profile more consistent with average-to-good sleep quality in this sample. Low self-reported stress and affective symptoms, objectively long and consistent sleep episodes, minimal naps, a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline, and low intradaily variability all point away from a high PSQI (poor sleep). Negative contributors—markedly late sleep timing, high evening screen/social activity, low physical activity, and some alcohol use—represent potential risks for poorer subjective sleep, but their measured associations with PSQI in this dataset are small and the participant’s concrete sleep metrics (duration, consolidation, consistency) are favorable. On balance, the evidence supports placement in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good/average sleep quality).

44927,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Sleep timing and duration
The participant’s Fitbit-derived sleep profile indicates a habitual, relatively late sleep schedule with a median sleep start around 00:59 (just before 01:00). Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 34 minutes, which is below the study mean and is moderately low relative to peers (Z = -0.77). Night-to-night variability in total sleep time is modestly lower than average (sleep duration SD = 66 minutes, Z = -0.79), indicating relatively consistent amounts of sleep across the recording period; variability in sleep start time is somewhat elevated (SD ≈ 94 minutes, Z = 0.23), indicating occasional shifts in bedtime. Napping is infrequent (mean daily naps = 0.07), so total sleep is driven primarily by nocturnal sleep. In combination, these features describe a student who sleeps somewhat less than the cohort average, goes to bed late, but maintains relatively consistent total sleep from night to night.

Circadian and nocturnal physiology
Heart-rate-based circadian metrics show a reasonably regular diurnal rhythm but with slightly reduced amplitude and mesor relative to the study sample (Mesor = 71.6, Z = -0.33; Amplitude = 9.6, Z = -0.39). Nonparametric rhythm features are close to the cohort mean (interdaily stability = 0.39, Z = -0.16; intradaily variability = 0.52, Z = -0.18), suggesting moderate day-to-day regularity without marked fragmentation. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, Z = -0.42), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show a pronounced nocturnal trough between ~1:00–6:00 AM (largest negative deviations, e.g., -14 to -22 bpm) and clear morning-to-afternoon elevations peaking across the late morning/afternoon hours. The acrophase near mid-afternoon (≈ 3:34 PM) and the morning rise in heart rate are consistent with a typical diurnal pattern, while the deep nighttime trough aligns with consolidated nocturnal quiescence.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context
Self-report measures indicate low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety near the sample average (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13). Self-esteem is above the cohort mean (RSES score 32, Z = -0.87 indicates fewer concerns relative to sample), and general stress is close to average (Score = 22, Z ≈ 0.1). The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use) and engages in sports three times per week or more (Z = 1.58), aligning with the low resting heart rate and suggesting regular physical activity. Recreational habits include above-average time listening to music; screen- and sedentary-hobby time are low. Overall, the psychosocial profile and lifestyle factors are more consistent with protective influences on sleep (regular exercise, low substance use, low depressive symptoms) than with strong sleep-disrupting behaviors.

Integrated interpretation for sleep quality (PSQI-related inference)
Evidence consistent with better or average sleep quality: low depressive symptoms, low substance use, regular vigorous physical activity, low napping, low night-to-night variability in sleep duration, and physiological indicators of consolidated nocturnal quiescence (pronounced overnight heart rate trough and low resting HR) all point toward sleep that is reasonably restorative and structured. Evidence consistent with poorer sleep quality: total sleep time is somewhat short (median ~6.5 hours) and bedtimes are late (near 01:00), which can contribute to subjective or objective reductions in sleep quality as captured by PSQI components. However, the magnitude of these adverse features is moderate rather than extreme, and circadian regularity metrics are near the cohort average rather than indicating major disruption.

Overall PSQI group placement
Weighing the available multimodal evidence holistically, the participant shows more signals that align with average-to-better sleep quality than with pronounced sleep disturbance. Although total sleep time is slightly below the cohort mean and bedtimes are late, protective factors (low depressive symptoms, low substance use, frequent sports activity, low nap frequency, consistent nightly sleep duration, and physiological consolidation of sleep) argue against a high PSQI score. Therefore the balance of evidence favors placement in the bottom half of the study PSQI distribution (i.e., lower or median PSQI scores, representing relatively good/average sleep quality).

71894,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and affective profile:
The participant reports markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 34, Z = 2.15) and trait anxiety (STAI = 64, Z = 2.24), together indicating a substantially higher affective symptom burden than the study sample average. These elevations are accompanied by very low self‑esteem (RSES = 19, Z = -2.7), low self‑reported happiness (current = 2.0, Z = -1.61), and low satisfaction with physical health (Z = -1.95). Within the study sample the CES‑D and STAI scores show moderate positive correlations with PSQI (r ≈ 0.5 and r ≈ 0.41 respectively), indicating that the participant’s high symptom levels are factors that, statistically, are associated with poorer sleep quality in this cohort.

Behavioral and lifestyle context:
The participant engages in frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more) and limited team/sport participation. Substance use is minimal (beer less than 1–2 times/month, no wine/liquor or recreational/non‑prescribed drugs). Daily recreation patterns include very high internet use and prolonged listening to music (both >4 hours, Z ≈ 2.1), substantial socializing time (3–4 hours, Z ≈ 1.74), and very low time spent watching TV or gaming. High evening/night media exposure and extensive internet use may increase evening cognitive or emotional arousal and are modestly associated with worse PSQI in the sample (correlations small but positive).

Objective sleep timing and duration:
Fitbit-derived sleep summary shows a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 43 minutes (Z = -0.58), placing total sleep time slightly below the study average but not extreme. Median sleep start time is near midnight (23:55) with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 58 minutes, Z ≈ -0.56); likewise sleep duration variability is relatively low (SD 54 minutes, Z = -1.06). The objective data therefore describe a fairly consistent, slightly short sleep schedule with minimal napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). However, small positive correlations between sleep variability measures and PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.17–0.2) suggest that greater instability would be linked to worse sleep—this participant’s lower variability is a modestly protective feature.

Physiological and circadian indicators:
Heart‑rate–based circadian metrics show a modestly elevated mesor (mean HR ≈ 80.9 bpm, Z = 0.95) and slightly elevated resting heart rate (63.6 bpm, Z = 0.65). Amplitude is below the cohort mean (8.47, Z = -0.75), while interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.47, Z = 0.5) and intradaily variability is moderately elevated (0.66, Z = 0.81). The aggregated hourly deviations reveal pronounced morning increases in heart rate (large positive deviations and very high Zs at 6–8 AM) and normal nocturnal decreases. Together these findings indicate a robust and consistent daily timing (stable day‑to‑day schedule) but reduced circadian amplitude and greater within‑day fragmentation of heart‑rate activity, features that can reflect physiological arousal and attenuated circadian contrast between sleep and wake. In the cohort, lower amplitude and markers of arousal show small correlations with worse PSQI (amplitude r ≈ -0.11; resting HR r ≈ 0.12), supporting the interpretation that these physiological patterns are plausibly related to reduced subjective sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation relevant to PSQI:
The strongest signals predictive of poorer PSQI in this case are the high depressive and anxiety symptom burden, low self‑esteem and health satisfaction, and physiological markers of reduced circadian amplitude and elevated arousal. Objective sleep duration is mildly below average and sleep timing is consistent but somewhat late (near midnight). Protective features include relatively low night‑to‑night variability and minimal napping. Because depressive and anxiety symptoms in this sample show the largest correlations with PSQI and this participant’s scores on those measures are substantially elevated (Z > 2), the overall balance of evidence points toward relatively poor sleep quality compared with the cohort. On a holistic basis, the participant’s profile is more consistent with a PSQI score in the higher half of the study distribution.

{""psqi_group"":""top_50""}"
30453,16.0,1.0,"Paragraph 1 — Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report profile is marked by elevated depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 31, Z = 1.84, labeled “Depressed”) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 51, Z = 0.96). Self-esteem and momentary positive affect are relatively low (Rosenberg RSES = 27, Z = −1.57; “Happy” current rating Z = −1.61). Stress is modestly above average (score Z ≈ 0.38). These trait and state measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40, self-esteem r ≈ −0.35), indicating that the participant’s elevated mood symptoms and lower self-esteem are likely to be linked with worse subjective sleep quality in the sample.

Paragraph 2 — Reported sleep behavior and timing:
Sleep-timing and duration patterns from the wearables show a late and irregular nocturnal sleep schedule. Median sleep start time is late at approximately 01:21 AM, and median nightly sleep duration is relatively short at 6 hours 25 minutes (Z ≈ −0.96 relative to the study). Night-to-night variability is substantial: sleep-duration standard deviation is high (145 minutes, Z ≈ 1.0) and sleep-start-time variability is elevated (SD ≈ 95 minutes, Z ≈ 0.26). The participant reports essentially no habitual napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z ≈ −0.86). These objective timing features — late bedtimes combined with short and inconsistent sleep — are commonly associated with worse sleep quality and are reflected in small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI (sleep variability r ≈ 0.18–0.19).

Paragraph 3 — Circadian regularity and physiological arousal:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate an overall pattern of weakened day–night physiological contrast and reduced regularity. Interdaily stability is low (0.30, Z ≈ −0.9), intradaily variability is mildly elevated (0.63, Z ≈ 0.6), and 24-hour autocorrelation is low (0.27, Z ≈ −0.45), suggesting that day-to-day rhythm strength and consistency are attenuated. Amplitude from cosinor analysis is somewhat reduced (amplitude Z ≈ −0.63) while MESOR and resting heart rate are elevated relative to the sample (MESOR 80.18, Z ≈ 0.85; resting HR 67.5 bpm, Z ≈ 1.11). The hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal HR reduction (largest negative deviations around 1–6 AM) and daytime peaks in the mid-to-late afternoon, but overall blunting of amplitude and elevated baseline heart rate imply higher physiological arousal or sympathetic tone across the recording period. These physiological features align with irregular sleep timing and are modestly associated with poorer PSQI in the sample.

Paragraph 4 — Behavioral context and potential protective factors:
Behavioral habits show limited substance use (no reported alcohol or recreational drug use), regular physical activity (frequent sports and exercising with others, Z positive), and engagement in reading and music (high Z-scores for listening to music and reading). Low substance use and higher social/exercise engagement are factors that can support sleep, but in this case they do not appear to offset the combined impact of late and variable sleep timing, elevated mood symptoms, and indicators of increased physiological arousal.

Paragraph 5 — Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality:
Integrating subjective and objective information, the participant shows multiple convergent indicators of reduced sleep quality: substantive depressive and anxiety symptom burden (strong correlates of worse PSQI), late habitual sleep onset, shorter-than-average median sleep duration, high night-to-night variability, reduced circadian stability and amplitude, and an elevated resting heart rate. While some behavioral supports (regular exercise, low substance use) are present, the weight of evidence — particularly the psychological symptom load and objective irregularity/insufficiency of sleep — points toward worse-than-average overall sleep quality relative to the study population.

66047,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant exhibits markedly elevated affective symptomatology and psychosocial distress relative to the study population. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D is very high (score = 46; Z = 3.4), and trait anxiety is also elevated (STAI = 73; Z = 3.13), both of which are established correlates of poorer sleep. Self-esteem and perceived physical health satisfaction are well below average (Rosenberg score = 21, Z = -2.42; health satisfaction Z = -2.28), and reported happiness is low (Z = -1.61). Stress is moderately elevated (score 24; Z = 0.65). Lifestyle indices show low physical activity (exercise frequencies at or below the lower end of the sample distribution) and relatively high sedentary/recreational screen time (TV/videos > 4 hours, internet use > 4 hours; Z-scores 3.17 and 2.19 respectively). These psychosocial and behavioral features—high depressive and anxiety symptoms, low self-esteem and health satisfaction, low exercise, and high evening/overall screen exposure—are together consistent with a psychological profile that tends to co-occur with impaired sleep quality.

Sleep timing, variability, and subjective-objective patterning: Wearable-recorded sleep quantity is near the sample average for central tendency (median nightly sleep = 7 h 15 min; Z = 0.08). However, the timing and stability of sleep diverge from normative sleep patterns: median sleep onset is very late (approximately 02:41 AM) with notable night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 84 minutes; sleep duration SD ≈ 106 minutes). The participant also has a higher-than-typical frequency of naps (mean daily naps = 0.28; Z = 2.4), which, together with late and variable bedtimes, indicates a shifted and somewhat fragmented sleep-wake schedule. These timing and variability features are known to undermine perceived sleep quality even when total sleep time is in an acceptable range, and several of the variability metrics (sleep duration SD and sleep start SD) show positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset, supporting their relevance to poorer subjective sleep.

Physiological and circadian signals from wearable data: Heart-rate–based circadian summaries show a modestly elevated overall cardiac set point (Mesor = 80.2 bpm, Z = 0.85) and a higher resting heart rate (68.4 bpm, Z = 1.22) relative to peers. Nonparametric rhythm metrics are near average but slightly shifted toward more intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.58, Z = 0.24) and only modest interdaily regularity (interdaily stability = 0.43, Z = 0.17). The cosinor acrophase (peak HR ≈ 6:35 PM) and the hourly aggregate deviations reveal relatively elevated heart rate around midnight (e.g., +5.8 bpm at 12–1am and +1.7 bpm at 1–2am) followed by a progressive nocturnal decline into the early morning (largest negative deviations between ~2–9am). The combination of elevated nocturnal HR around typical sleep onset hours and an elevated resting HR suggests physiological arousal during late-night hours and a circadian pattern that may be phase-delayed and somewhat blunted in amplitude (amplitude Z = -0.31). These objective physiological markers align with the behavioral pattern of late bedtimes and could contribute to sleep disruption and poorer subjective sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation relative to PSQI distribution: Several convergent lines of evidence indicate that this participant is more likely to fall in the worse-sleep (higher PSQI) half of the sample. High depressive and anxiety symptom scores (both strongly associated with PSQI in the study data), late and variable sleep timing, increased napping, elevated resting and nocturnal heart rate indicative of late-night physiological arousal, low exercise, and high evening screen time all point toward compromised sleep quality despite an average median sleep duration. While total sleep time alone would not necessarily indicate poor sleep, the timing, variability, physiological arousal signals, and the strong affective symptom burden together increase the likelihood of higher PSQI scores. On balance, the multimodal data support classification in the top half of the PSQI distribution (poorer sleep quality).

79834,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Sleep behavior and wearable-derived sleep physiology
The wearable-recorded sleep profile is characterized by objectively long and relatively stable nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep was 8 hours 18 minutes (Z = +1.39), substantially above the study mean, with a low-to-moderate night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 85 minutes; Z = -0.35) and a relatively consistent sleep onset time (median start ~00:46; start-time SD = 52 minutes; Z = -0.68). The participant reported virtually no naps (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). Together these features indicate sustained, consolidated nocturnal opportunity for sleep across the recording period rather than fragmented or highly inconsistent sleep timing.

Physiological circadian and cardiac markers are congruent with consolidated nocturnal rest and intact diurnal organization. Resting heart rate was low (52.9 bpm; Z = -0.62), and the hourly aggregate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate nadir (largest negative deviations around 2:00–5:00 AM of roughly -14 to -21 bpm from the mesor), consistent with consolidated, physiologically restorative sleep. The cosinor-derived features show a modestly lower mesor (69.8 bpm; Z = -0.57) and a modestly elevated amplitude (12.5; Z = +0.56), with acrophase in the late afternoon (about 5:23 PM), indicating a clear daytime–nighttime separation of cardiovascular activity. Interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.37; Z = -0.33) while intradaily variability is low (0.41; Z = -0.95), which suggests reasonably low within-day fragmentation of activity but a small degree of day-to-day timing variability. Elevated evening heart-rate deviations (notably 6–7 PM and 9–10 PM with positive Z-scores up to ~1.6) may reflect evening activity or arousal but do not appear to produce overnight physiological disturbance given the deep nocturnal dip.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context
Self-report measures indicate low current symptom burden on core affective dimensions that commonly co-vary with sleep problems: depressive symptom score is low (CES-D = 8; Z = -0.55, classified “not depressed”), trait anxiety is below the cohort mean (STAI = 37; Z = -0.43), and perceived stress is relatively low (Stress score Z = -0.71). Self-esteem is high (RSES Z = -0.17 toward the upper range) and health satisfaction is above average (Z = +0.55). These psychological features are more consistent with preserved subjective sleep quality than with chronic sleep impairment.

Lifestyle factors that can counteract good sleep are present but limited. The participant reports frequent wine or liquor use (three times a week or more; Z = +1.68), which can fragment sleep architecture and affect subjective sleep quality in some individuals. Physical activity is minimal (exercise and sports Z-scores between -1.09 and -1.58), which is a potential risk for poorer sleep consolidation in the longer term. Daily recreational habits are generally low in evening screen time and sedentary hobbies, which reduces some typical sources of sleep disruption. Overall, the psychological profile and many objective sleep indices point toward preserved sleep quality, while the combination of low activity and frequent alcohol use is a moderate countervailing influence to monitor.

Integration and inference about PSQI group
Evidence supporting relatively good or average PSQI (lower PSQI scores, bottom half of the distribution) includes: objectively long median sleep duration (≈8h18m; Z = +1.39), low nap frequency, relatively stable sleep timing (lower variability Zs), pronounced nocturnal heart-rate trough and low resting heart rate (indices consistent with restorative sleep), and low levels of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. Correlations between many wearable features and PSQI in the dataset are small and do not contradict this overall pattern. Evidence that could point toward poorer sleep (higher PSQI) is limited to the high frequency of wine/liquor consumption and low exercise levels; there is also a modest reduction in interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.33) and some elevated evening heart-rate deviations that could reflect late-day arousal. However, these factors are relatively modest in magnitude compared with the clear objective indicators of consolidated, ample sleep and low symptom burden.

Holistically, the balance of multimodal evidence indicates that the participant is more likely to have a PSQI score in the lower (better) portion of the study distribution. The objective sleep quantity and physiological signs of nocturnal recovery, combined with low affective symptom scores, outweigh the moderate lifestyle risk factors. On the basis of the available data, assign the participant to the bottom half of the PSQI distribution (bottom_50).

33133,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"Psychological and affective profile:
The participant reports marked affective symptoms: a CES-D score of 31 (Z = 1.84, classification “Depressed”) and a trait anxiety score (STAI) of 49 (Z = 0.76). Both of these symptom indices have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating that higher depressive and anxiety symptoms in this participant are likely to be associated with worse self-reported sleep quality. Self-esteem is near the sample mean (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17) and subjective happiness is somewhat below average (Z ≈ -0.53), while perceived stress is elevated (Z ≈ 0.65). Taken together, the affective profile contains multiple risk features—particularly elevated depressive symptomatology and anxiety—that are commonly associated with poorer sleep reports.

Sleep timing, quantity, and variability:
Wearable-derived sleep shows a median nightly duration of about 6 hours 38 minutes (Z = -0.68), which is shorter than the study mean and below 7 hours. Nightly sleep start is late on average (median start ≈ 00:40), with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (start-time SD ≈ 101 minutes, Z = 0.39). The participant’s sleep duration standard deviation (63 minutes) is below the population mean (Z = -0.85), indicating somewhat less variability in duration than many peers despite late and somewhat variable onsets. Mean daily naps are minimal (≈0.09 naps/day). Shorter median sleep, late sleep onset, and some variability in timing are patterns that tend to relate to worse subjective sleep quality in student samples.

Circadian and physiological signatures:
Heart-rate based circadian metrics are broadly near sample averages: MESOR ~73.5 bpm (Z ≈ -0.06) and resting heart rate ~58.6 bpm (Z ≈ 0.05). Amplitude is slightly below average (10.11, Z ≈ -0.22). Non-parametric rhythm features show modest fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.63, Z = 0.60) with average interdaily stability (0.40, Z ≈ -0.08). The aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected overnight troughs and a pronounced morning rise (notably 8–9am +16 bpm, Z = 2.09), suggesting a relatively large morning arousal response. Slightly elevated intradaily variability and reduced amplitude indicate a circadian profile that is somewhat less robust and more fragmented than average, patterns that can be associated with sleep disturbance.

Behavioral and lifestyle context:
The participant reports moderate-to-high engagement in exercise (exercising alone three times a week or more; Z ≈ 1.07), which is a behavior generally protective for sleep. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ +1 for alcohol indices). Internet use is elevated (3–4 hours/day, Z ≈ 1.52), and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Socializing and sedentary leisure times are near or below average. Taken together, lifestyle factors are mixed: protective elements (regular exercise, low napping) coexist with risk elements (weekly alcohol consumption, elevated evening internet exposure and late bedtimes) that can negatively influence sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation with respect to PSQI:
Multiple converging signals point toward a greater likelihood of poorer subjective sleep quality. The participant’s markedly elevated depressive symptoms and elevated trait anxiety—two of the strongest correlates with PSQI in the sample—are salient risk factors. Objective sleep duration is shorter than average (~6 h 38 min) and sleep onset is relatively late, and wearable circadian metrics show modest fragmentation (higher intradaily variability) and slightly blunted amplitude; these objective features typically accompany higher PSQI scores. Protective factors (regular exercise, minimal napping, average resting heart rate) are present but do not fully offset the risk conferred by affective symptom burden, late sleep timing, and some circadian irregularity. Considering the relative magnitudes and known correlations in the study sample, the overall balance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the higher-PSQI (worse sleep quality) half of the study distribution.

47810,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Sleep timing and duration: The participant’s wearable-derived sleep profile is characterized by a relatively late habitual sleep onset and modestly short nocturnal sleep. Median sleep start time across the semester was 01:26 AM, and median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 40 minutes (Z = -0.65 relative to the study sample), indicating shorter-than-average nighttime sleep. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD = 106 minutes, Z = 0.11) and sleep start time variability is moderately large (SD = 65 minutes, Z = -0.40), which together suggest an inconsistent sleep schedule. Daytime compensatory behavior is present at a higher-than-typical rate: mean daily naps = 0.27 (Z = 2.34). These behavioral features — late sleep onset, somewhat restricted nocturnal sleep, high variability, and increased napping — are patterns commonly associated with subjective reports of poorer sleep quality.

Circadian and physiological activity patterns: Heart-rate-based circadian summary measures indicate an intact but somewhat irregular 24-hour structure. Parametric metrics (MESOR ≈ 75 bpm, amplitude ≈ 12.4) are within modest deviation of the cohort, while intradaily variability is elevated (0.83, Z = 2.01), pointing to greater fragmentation of activity/physiological state across the day. Interdaily stability is near sample average (0.40, Z = -0.08) but autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.21, Z = -0.95), consistent with day-to-day schedule inconsistency. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and afternoon/evening elevations with an acrophase at ~4:46 PM; resting heart rate is relatively low (56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22), which likely reflects fitness/parasympathetic tone rather than sleep quality per se. The combination of elevated intradaily variability and reduced 24-hour autocorrelation supports an interpretation of physiologic rhythm fragmentation that often accompanies irregular sleep timing and may degrade subjective sleep quality.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context: Self-report measures show modest depressive symptoms (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18) and average-to-low trait anxiety (STAI = 37, Z = -0.43). Self-esteem is high and exercise is reported at low-to-moderate frequency (exercise 1–2×/week). Alcohol use is limited (wine 1–2×/week; beer not at all); other recreational substance use is absent. Health satisfaction and self-rated happiness are somewhat below the sample mean (health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.7; happiness Z ≈ -0.53). The behavioral profile (moderate exercise, low substance use) contains protective elements for sleep, but the participant’s subjective well-being and the objective markers of irregular sleep/circadian fragmentation are more strongly aligned with worse sleep outcomes in this dataset (several relevant metrics — sleep variability, napping, later sleep timing — show positive correlations with PSQI in the sample).

Synthesis and PSQI group assignment: Weighing the objective wearable indicators (shorter median sleep, high night-to-night variability, elevated intradaily variability, frequent napping, late sleep onset) together with the psychosocial profile (mild depressive symptom burden, lower health satisfaction), the preponderance of evidence points toward relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the study population median. Although the participant has some favorable signs (low resting heart rate, moderate exercise, minimal substance use), the patterns most strongly associated with higher PSQI scores in this cohort—irregular timing, fragmented circadian activity, and variable sleep duration—are present. On balance, the data are more consistent with a PSQI score in the higher half of the study distribution (i.e., worse than median).

58196,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"The participant’s self-report profile indicates broadly favorable psychological and lifestyle conditions that typically support sleep quality. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 6, Z ≈ -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z ≈ -1.02) are well below the study mean, and current happiness and health-satisfaction ratings are relatively high (happiness Z ≈ 1.64; health satisfaction Z ≈ 1.38). Self-esteem is elevated relative to the sample (RSES Z ≈ 1.1). The participant reports regular exercise (both alone and with others, Z > 1.0), minimal recreational drug use, and limited sedentary media time. These psychosocial and behavioral features—especially low depressive and anxiety symptoms and high self-esteem/happiness—are among the strongest survey-level predictors of better PSQI scores in this dataset (noting CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI are moderate and positive in the sample). On balance, the self-report data point toward subjectively better-than-average sleep-related functioning.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics present a mixed picture. Resting heart rate and mesor are lower than the study mean (resting HR = 53.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.56; mesor Z ≈ -1.01), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and with the participant’s higher exercise frequency. The cosinor acrophase is mid-afternoon (≈3:36 PM), and hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough and afternoon/evening elevation. However, summary circadian regularity measures suggest reduced rhythm robustness and greater within-day fragmentation: interdaily stability is below average (0.34, Z ≈ -0.57) and intradaily variability is elevated (0.66, Z ≈ 0.81), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.22, Z ≈ -0.87). These features indicate less consistent day-to-day timing of physiological activity and more within-day variability—patterns that can be associated with sleep irregularity and poorer sleep consolidation, although in this sample their direct correlations with PSQI are small.

Objective sleep measures show modest deviations from optimal sleep quantity and timing but not extreme disturbance. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 33 minutes (Z ≈ -0.79), below conventional recommendations and below the study mean, and the median sleep start time is relatively late (≈01:02 AM). Night-to-night variability is moderate (sleep SD ≈ 82 minutes, Z ≈ -0.42) and sleep start time variability (SD ≈ 72 minutes, Z ≈ -0.24) indicates some inconsistency in bedtime. Mean daily naps are infrequent but somewhat elevated relative to peers (0.15 naps/day, Z ≈ 0.94). Although shorter sleep duration, later bedtimes, and greater variability are commonly linked to worse PSQI, the sample-level correlations between these particular wearable sleep metrics and PSQI are modest in magnitude in this dataset.

Synthesizing the multimodal evidence: psychosocial and behavioral indicators (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, frequent exercise, low substance/drug use) strongly favor relatively good subjective sleep quality. Objective wearable indicators point to some circadian irregularity and a slightly shortened, late-timed sleep pattern that could elevate sleep complaints, but many of those objective markers show only small correlations with PSQI in the study data. Given the stronger and more predictive self-report profile together with only modest objective disruption, the overall balance of evidence suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the lower (better) half of the PSQI distribution rather than the top half.

62246,3.0,0.015706806282722512,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant’s self-report survey profile indicates generally low affective symptom burden and adaptive psychosocial functioning. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are low (score = 4, Z = -0.97) and trait anxiety is also low (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82). Self-reported self-esteem and health satisfaction are above the study mean (self-esteem Z = 0.96; health satisfaction Z = 0.63). Academic performance is strong (GPA records 3.74–3.90). Recreational substance use is limited to moderate, regular alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor reported 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0 for alcohol items) with no reported recreational or non-prescribed drug use. The participant reports regular physical activity (exercising alone ≥3×/week, Z = 1.07) and minimal sedentary/leisure screen time. These psychosocial and lifestyle features—low depression/anxiety, higher self-esteem and health satisfaction, regular exercise, and minimal drug use—are typically associated with better subjective sleep quality and lower PSQI scores in this population (several survey items here have moderate correlations with PSQI, e.g., CES-D r ≈ 0.49 and STAI r ≈ 0.40, though the participant’s low symptom levels point toward lower PSQI risk).

Sleep behavior and Fitbit-derived sleep statistics: Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show sleep that is longer and relatively stable compared with the study sample. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 39 minutes (Z = 0.59), and night-to-night variability in duration is relatively low (standard deviation ≈ 65 minutes, Z = -0.82). Median sleep start time is approximately 23:56 with a modest standard deviation (~78 minutes, Z = -0.11), and mean daily naps are essentially zero (Z = -0.86). These features — sufficient average total sleep time, low variability in duration, consistent bedtimes, and absence of daytime napping — all align with behavioral patterns that are associated with better overall sleep quality and lower PSQI scores in the study population.

Circadian and cardiovascular rhythm indicators: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a generally coherent, low-fragmentation circadian profile. Interdaily stability of the heart-rate rhythm is moderate (0.44, Z = 0.25) and intradaily variability is low (0.32, Z = -1.59), suggesting regular day-to-day structure and limited fragmentation of activity/rest cycles. Cosinor parameters show a mesor of 78.05 bpm (Z = 0.56) and amplitude of 12.24 (Z = 0.47) with an acrophase in the mid-afternoon (4:23 PM); resting heart rate is relatively low at 57 bpm (Z = -0.14). The aggregated hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reduction (largest deviations between ~3–7 AM) and a daytime rise peaking in mid-afternoon—consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and daytime activity. Overall these physiological markers support a well-entrained circadian pattern and low nocturnal arousal, factors that favor better objective and subjective sleep quality.

Potential countervailing signals and integrative interpretation: There are few clear signals pointing to poor sleep in this dataset. Alcohol use at 1–2 times per week is a possible behavioral factor that can negatively influence sleep continuity for some individuals, but the participant reports no daytime naps and shows low sleep fragmentation and stable durations, which mitigate concern. Self-reported current happiness is slightly below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.53), and stress is near the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.17), but levels of depression and anxiety are low—both of which are more strongly predictive of PSQI in this sample. Correlations supplied with the dataset show that depressive and anxiety scores relate positively with PSQI; because this participant’s affective symptom scores are low, those correlations would predict a lower PSQI. Taken together—objective sleep longer than average and regular, low variability, coherent circadian physiology, low affective symptoms, active exercise habits, and minimal napping—the preponderance of evidence points toward relatively good sleep quality.

PSQI group decision: Integrating the multimodal behavioral, survey, and wearable-derived physiological data, the balance of evidence indicates that the participant’s overall sleep quality is likely at or better than the study median. Their objective sleep duration, low variability, circadian regularity, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, and health-promoting behaviors are more consistent with lower PSQI scores (i.e., better sleep). Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the PSQI distribution (better/average sleep quality).

These self-report markers indicate a high level of psychological distress relative to the study population. Health and academic indices are mixed: health satisfaction is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.38) and academic performance is strong (GPAs ~3.8–3.9). Substance use is low-to-moderate (alcohol ~1–2x/month, no recreational/non-prescribed drug use), and physical activity includes regular group exercise (three+ times/week, Z = 1.23), which may be a protective behavioral factor.

Wearable-derived sleep timing and duration: Objectively, the participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 24 minutes (Z = 0.27), which is slightly above the study mean and in a range typically associated with adequate sleep duration. Night-to-night variability in duration is relatively low (SD = 69 minutes; Z = -0.72), and sleep start time variability is modest (SD ≈ 58 minutes; Z = -0.54), both suggesting relatively consistent sleep quantity and timing. Median sleep start time is around 00:21 (12:21 AM), which is late by conventional schedules but not atypical for student populations. Daytime napping frequency is elevated (mean daily naps = 0.24; Z = 1.9), which can reflect compensatory behavior for perceived or actual sleep insufficiency or fragmented sleep.

Circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Circadian rhythm summary metrics from heart rate are near the cohort norms: interdaily stability (0.42; Z = 0.09) indicates modest day-to-day regularity, intradaily variability (0.48; Z = -0.46) is relatively low consistent with limited fragmentation of physiological activity rhythms, and amplitude (11.82; Z = 0.34) shows a modest day–night contrast. Resting heart rate is slightly below average (57.6 bpm; Z = -0.07). Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations between ~2–5 AM, values around -20 bpm) and a clear afternoon/early-evening peak (largest positive deviations ~3–8 PM). These patterns describe a robust heart-rate circadian profile with clear nocturnal reductions in cardiovascular arousal and daytime elevations.

Integration and implications for perceived sleep quality (PSQI): Objective wearable indicators point to generally adequate and fairly regular sleep timing and duration, a clear circadian structure, and limited physiological fragmentation—factors that would support a lower (better) PSQI score. Counterbalancing this, the participant has substantially elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (CES-D and STAI), low subjective happiness, and frequent daytime napping; these psychosocial features have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.48; STAI r ≈ 0.39) and are strong predictors of worse self-reported sleep quality. Given that PSQI is a subjective global index sensitive to mood and perceived sleep problems, the large magnitude of self-reported psychological distress is likely to elevate the participant’s PSQI score even in the presence of objectively adequate sleep duration and circadian regularity. On balance—weighting the relatively strong influence of depressive and anxiety symptoms on subjective sleep quality higher than the modestly favorable objective sleep metrics—the evidence suggests this participant would more likely fall into the top half of the study distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively poorer self-reported sleep quality).

23576,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports low affective symptom burden (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72). Self-esteem is above the sample mean (RSES, Z = 0.96) and global ratings of health satisfaction are also above average (Z = 0.72). Academic functioning appears strong (GPA near ceiling). These self-report indicators point toward a generally favorable psychological profile during the recording period. Relevant to sleep, the study correlations show moderate positive associations between depressive symptoms and PSQI (r ≈ 0.49) and between trait anxiety and PSQI (r ≈ 0.40); because this participant scores low on those scales, those particular risk pathways for poorer sleep quality are less prominent here.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle: The participant reports frequent exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week; exercise-frequency Z-scores positive) and minimal substance use (no reported alcohol or recreational drug use), both behaviors that are typically supportive of sleep health. Leisure screen use is somewhat elevated relative to the sample (watching TV/videos 1–2 hours, Z = 1.28; video games ~31 minutes, Z = 1.71), which can increase risk for later sleep onset in some individuals, but this participant shows little evidence of irregular sleep timing or napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86), suggesting that elevated evening screen time has not translated into broad daytime sleep compensation or frequent napping.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: Objective sleep estimates from the wearable show a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 46 minutes (Z = 0.72), which is longer than the study mean and within a range usually associated with adequate sleep. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is low (SD = 58 minutes, Z = -0.98), and sleep start times are relatively consistent (median start ~00:38, start-time SD = 45 minutes, Z = -0.83). Together these metrics indicate both sufficient total sleep and consistent timing. Circadian-derived heart rate features show modest-to-typical stability of daily rhythms (interdaily stability = 0.47, Z = 0.50; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.45, Z = 1.06), and only small deviations from population means in amplitude and mesor. Resting heart rate is slightly below the sample mean (57.6 bpm, Z = -0.07), consistent with good cardiovascular baseline. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show clear nocturnal reductions and daytime elevations in expected windows; none of these heart-rate features provide strong evidence of nocturnal physiological arousal that would suggest disturbed sleep.

Integrative interpretation relative to PSQI: Indicators most strongly associated with worse PSQI scores in the study (higher depressive symptoms, higher trait anxiety, greater night-to-night sleep variability, and markers of circadian disruption) are largely absent or attenuated for this participant. Objective sleep duration is above average and regular (both protective), night-to-night variability is low (protective; study correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.20), and there is no evidence of frequent napping or elevated resting physiological arousal. The only potential risk signals are elevated leisure screen time in the evening and a somewhat late median sleep start (~12:38 AM), but these have not produced measurable instability or sleep curtailment in the wearable data. Weighed holistically, the multimodal profile (low depressive/anxiety scores, regular and adequate objective sleep, consistent circadian heart-rate rhythms, frequent exercise, no substance use) aligns with a relatively low PSQI score compared with the study distribution.

93485,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"The participant’s self-report profile indicates generally low affective symptom burden and favorable self-assessments that are commonly associated with better sleep. Depression (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62) are both below the study mean; perceived stress is also modestly lower than average (Z = -0.44). Self-esteem and satisfaction with physical health are relatively high (RSES Z = 0.82; health satisfaction Z = 1.8), and academic performance is strong. Together these trait and well-being indicators point toward psychosocial conditions that typically support, rather than disrupt, sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality.

Behavioral sleep metrics from the wearable and self-report show sleep timing and duration that are consistent with broadly adequate sleep opportunity and relative stability. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours and 1 minute (Z = -0.20), and night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 70 minutes, Z = -0.69) is lower than average in the sample, suggesting more consistent total sleep time across the recording period. The median sleep start time near 00:58 (roughly 1:00 AM) indicates a relatively late habitual bedtime but the standard deviation of start times is not elevated (SD ≈ 81 minutes, Z ≈ -0.05), implying a consistent schedule despite the later clock time. The participant reports essentially no napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), which reduces potential fragmentation of nocturnal sleep opportunity.

Physiological circadian and cardiovascular indicators from heart rate data are consistent with a robust, well-entrained rest–activity rhythm. Nonparametric and cosinor-derived circadian features show higher-than-average interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and a large amplitude (16.65, Z = 1.9), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is also elevated (Z = 1.23). The hourly aggregate heart rate deviations reveal pronounced nocturnal reductions (−20 to −32 bpm below mesor between ~1–6 AM) and marked daytime elevations peaking in late morning/early afternoon (+~11–21 bpm), consistent with consolidated nighttime rest and clear daytime arousal. Resting heart rate is low (47.3 bpm, Z = -1.29), which often reflects higher cardiovascular fitness and can accompany more restorative nocturnal physiology. These circadian and heart-rate features collectively indicate coherent rhythmicity and physiological separation between sleep and wake periods.

Synthesizing behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived evidence yields a profile more consistent with relatively good or average sleep quality in this study sample. The participant’s objective sleep duration is in the normative range, night-to-night variability is below average, naps are absent, and circadian markers indicate a strong, regular rhythm with substantial nocturnal heart-rate decline. Psychological indicators that correlate positively with poor sleep (depressive symptoms, anxiety, perceived stress) are low here, and positive markers (self-esteem, health satisfaction, regular exercise) are elevated. Although the bedtime is somewhat late, the consistency of timing and adequate total sleep time mitigate its likely negative impact. Given these converging lines of evidence, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively better/average sleep quality).

62617,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate a broadly favorable psychological profile and health behavior pattern that are typically associated with better subjective sleep. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 1, Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) are well below the study mean. Self-esteem, happiness, trust, exercise frequency, and health satisfaction are above average (self-esteem Z = 1.24; happiness Z = 1.64; trust Z = 1.47; exercise frequency Zs ≈ 0.5–1.1; health satisfaction Z = 0.38). Substance and drug use are minimal to occasional (wine reported weekly, beer infrequent, no recreational drug use). These survey indicators point toward low affective burden, regular physical activity, and limited substance-related sleep disruption — all factors that tend to support restorative sleep and lower PSQI scores.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics: Heart-rate–based circadian measures show a mixed pattern. The participant’s interdaily stability is low (0.20, Z = -1.73), indicating less consistency in the timing of daily physiological rhythms across days, while intradaily variability is also low (0.34, Z = -1.45), suggesting relatively few large within-day transitions in activity/physiology. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is moderately elevated (0.44, Z = 0.98), implying some retained daily regularity despite low interdaily stability. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (7.67, Z = -1.01) and mesor is slightly above average (78.2, Z = 0.58), with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈5:03 PM). Resting heart rate is normative (60.6 bpm, Z = 0.29). Hourly aggregate deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations around 3–5 AM of ~-12 to -13 bpm) and daytime/evening elevations (peaking ~+11 bpm in early evening). Overall, the cardiovascular profile indicates normal nocturnal dipping and daytime activation but a circadian signal of reduced amplitude and somewhat inconsistent day-to-day timing.

Objective sleep behavior from wearables: The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is relatively long at ~8 hours 25 minutes (Z = 1.53), with modest night-to-night variability in duration (SD 78 minutes, Z = -0.51) and sleep start time (median 23:56, SD 70 minutes, Z = -0.28). Mean daily naps are essentially absent (0.0, Z = -0.86). These sleep statistics indicate adequate total sleep time on average and reasonably stable sleep duration across the semester, with a typical sleep onset close to midnight. The combination of long nightly sleep, low nap frequency, and reduced variability in duration is consistent with better sleep quantity and likely favorable components of the PSQI (e.g., sleep duration and daytime dysfunction components).

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): Putting the modalities together, most evidence supports comparatively good sleep quality. Low depressive and anxiety symptoms, frequent exercise, low substance use, long median sleep duration, low nap frequency, and low variability in sleep duration are all consistent with lower PSQI scores (better sleep). Counterbalancing this are indicators of reduced circadian amplitude and low interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.7), which could reflect irregular sleep–wake timing across days and theoretically contribute to some sleep complaints; however, the participant’s actual sleep timing variability (sleep start SD Z = -0.28) and sleep duration stability do not corroborate large behavioral irregularity. Heart rate rhythms demonstrate normal nocturnal dipping and a normative resting HR, which does not suggest physiologic arousal interfering with sleep. Correlations of these specific metrics with PSQI in the dataset are small and do not indicate strong risk signals.

Overall PSQI group assignment: On balance, the multimodal evidence — especially the objectively long median sleep duration, low affective symptom burden, frequent exercise, minimal napping, and relatively stable sleep duration — favors placement in the lower half of the population PSQI distribution (i.e., comparatively good or average sleep quality). The primary counter-indicator (low interdaily stability and reduced circadian amplitude) is notable but not accompanied by other signs of poor sleep (high variability in sleep timing, frequent naps, high stress, or elevated resting physiology). Therefore the participant is more consistent with the bottom 50% of the study population with respect to PSQI score.

42137,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Summary of sleep behavior and wearable-derived sleep statistics:
The participant’s objective sleep profile across the semester is characterized by a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 7 hours 18 minutes (Z = 0.14), a moderate night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 90 minutes; Z = −0.25) and a median sleep onset near 00:31 (SD of sleep-start 78 minutes; Z = −0.10). Daytime napping is rare (mean daily naps = 0.07; Z = −0.02). These wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate habitual sleep quantity that is at or slightly above the study population average and sleep timing consistency that is near the population mean. Correlations between these specific sleep statistics and PSQI are small (e.g., duration Z = 0.05, duration SD correlation = 0.20), suggesting only modest relationships between these objective sleep markers and self-reported global sleep quality in this sample.

Physiological circadian profile and heart-rate dynamics:
The participant shows a low overall heart-rate mesor (62.6 bpm; Z = −1.55) and a relatively low cosinor amplitude (8.56; Z = −0.72), indicating that average cardiovascular tone across the day is lower than typical for the cohort and that modeled rhythmic amplitude is somewhat reduced. However, the hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor reveal clear day–night differentiation: deep nocturnal troughs between ~1:00–6:00 AM (largest deviations −13 to −20 bpm, Zs around −0.3 to −0.8) and marked daytime elevations with prominent peaks in mid- to late-afternoon (notably 4–5 PM with +27.4 bpm; Z = 2.76) and strong morning increases around 9–11 AM. Interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.45; Z = 0.33), while intradaily variability is moderately elevated (0.63; Z = 0.60), which together suggest generally regular day-to-day structure but somewhat greater fragmentation or variability within days. Resting heart rate is relatively low (50.3 bpm; Z = −0.93). The overall pattern is one of low resting cardiovascular tone with distinct daytime activations and pronounced nocturnal suppression in aggregated hourly data; cosinor-derived amplitude is reduced relative to peers, which may reflect the combination of a low mesor and the specific shape of the participant’s daily profile.

Psychological traits, behaviors, and lifestyle factors relevant to sleep:
Self-report measures indicate low-to-moderate levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 15; Z = 0.18) and trait anxiety near the sample mean (STAI = 42; Z = 0.07). Subjective happiness is somewhat below average (Z = −0.53) and perceived stress is elevated relative to peers (stress score Z = 0.92), with stress showing a small positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.20). The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (≥ three times/week; Z = 1.07) and very limited substance use, both features typically associated with more favorable sleep. Sedentary hobby time is relatively high (Z = 1.41), and socializing time is lower than average (Z = −0.62). Taken together, the behavioral profile contains both protective elements for sleep (regular exercise, low substance use, adequate sleep duration) and potential risks (elevated stress, higher sedentary leisure, somewhat lower subjective well-being) that could modestly influence perceived sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation with respect to PSQI position:
Objective wearable metrics indicate adequate sleep quantity and reasonably consistent timing with limited naps, low resting heart rate, and a physiologic day–night separation in aggregated heart-rate deviations—features that would generally be expected to align with better or average global sleep quality. Some circadian summary metrics (reduced cosinor amplitude, elevated intradaily variability) and elevated self-reported stress and lower subjective happiness are sources of potential vulnerability for worse perceived sleep, but effect sizes and correlations with PSQI are small to modest across measures. Overall, the balance of evidence—adequate median sleep duration, relatively low night-to-night variability, minimal napping, low resting heart rate, and active exercise habits—favors placement in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively better or average sleep quality). There is not consistent or strong multimodal evidence indicating markedly poor sleep across objective and trait domains.

Final classification:
Based on the integrated behavioral, physiological, and self-report evidence, the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study population PSQI distribution (relatively good/average global sleep quality).

48013,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"The self-report profile indicates elevated affective symptomatology and low positive self-evaluations that are relevant to sleep regulation. Trait anxiety is high (STAI = 55, Z = 1.35) and depressive symptoms are elevated (CES‑D = 19, Z = 0.59); both of these scales show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (r ≈ 0.40–0.49), suggesting these symptoms are likely to co-occur with worse perceived sleep. Self-esteem is low (RSES = 28, Z = −1.43) and current happiness and interpersonal trust are below average (happiness Z = −1.61; trust Z = −2.07). The participant reports regular exercise (frequent alone and with others; exercise Z-scores > 1), which is typically associated with better sleep, and modest alcohol use (weekly wine/liquor) with no recreational drug use. Overall, the psychological profile and some lifestyle factors (high anxiety/depressive symptoms and low positive affect/trust) point toward increased risk for subjective sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular measures indicate reduced regularity and attenuated amplitude of daily physiological rhythms. Interdaily stability and 24‑hour autocorrelation are low (interdaily stability = 0.23, Z = −1.48; autocorrelation = 0.14, Z = −1.54), consistent with weak day-to-day alignment of activity/heart-rate patterns. Amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm is lower than average (amplitude = 7.44, Z = −1.08), while mesor and resting heart rate are within the population range (mesor ≈ 77.5 bpm, Z = 0.48; resting HR ≈ 59.3 bpm, Z = 0.14). The hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions (largest negative deviations around 3–5 AM) and a pronounced morning rise with an unusually large deviation at 6–7 AM (value 8.33, Z = 3.50), suggesting relatively strong morning cardiovascular arousal on average despite overall blunted circadian amplitude. Reduced interdaily stability and amplitude are generally associated with poorer sleep continuity and quality.

Objective wearable sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration close to seven hours (6 h 56 m, Z = −0.31), which by itself is near the population average, but sleep timing and variability suggest irregular and late sleep. The median sleep start time is approximately 01:04 AM with a large night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 119 minutes, Z = 0.80) and a high standard deviation in sleep duration (SD ≈ 151 minutes, Z = 1.13). These elevated variabilities—combined with late average sleep timing—are commonly linked to poorer subjective sleep and to higher PSQI scores in the literature; in this dataset, variability measures also show positive correlations with PSQI (e.g., sleep-duration SD r ≈ 0.20). The participant rarely naps (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07), so daytime napping is unlikely to explain the nightly irregularity.

Weighing the multimodal evidence holistically: protective features include a median nightly total sleep time near seven hours and frequent exercise, both of which are associated with better sleep. However, the balance of signals points toward elevated risk for poorer subjective sleep quality. Key contributors are elevated anxiety and depressive symptom scores (which correlate moderately with PSQI), late sleep timing with high night‑to‑night variability, and indicators of weakened circadian organization (low interdaily stability and reduced amplitude). These factors have well-established links to worse PSQI scores and, in aggregate, are more consistent with placement in the higher (worse) half of the population distribution for global PSQI. Therefore, the participant is more likely to have a PSQI score in the top 50% (poorer sleep quality).

14571,3.0,0.015706806282722512,"Summary of psychological and behavioral profile:
The self-report profile indicates low affective symptom burden and generally positive well-being. Depressive symptomatology is effectively absent (CES-D = 0, Z = -1.38) and trait anxiety is at the floor of the scale (STAI = 20, Z = -2.11), both of which are strongly predictive of better subjective sleep in the study correlations (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are relatively elevated (SelfEsteem Z = 1.1; Happy Z = 1.64), and perceived stress is low (Stress Z = -2.62). These psychological markers collectively point toward low internalizing burden and favorable affective functioning across the recording period, a profile that typically associates with lower PSQI scores (better subjective sleep).

Behavioral patterns relevant to sleep:
The participant reports very low physical activity (exercise and sports Z-scores between -0.88 and -1.93) and high engagement in sedentary recreational behaviors (TV, video games, internet, music, sedentary hobbies all well above study means; Zs range ~2.0–4.7). Substance use is minimal. High evening/nighttime screen and sedentary activity are behavioral risks for sleep timing and sleep-onset processes, even when total sleep time is adequate. The participant’s typical sleep start time is late (median start ≈ 01:04), which may reflect a delayed sleep schedule; late timing can increase likelihood of subjective sleep problems even when total duration is normal.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Objective sleep quantity and regularity are broadly supportive of adequate sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 h 14 min (Z = 0.06) with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 35 minutes, Z = -1.48) and minimal napping (mean naps ≈ 0.07/day). These features suggest consistent sleep opportunity and relatively stable sleep duration. Circadian metrics derived from heart rate show strong day-to-day rhythm stability (Interdaily Stability = 0.70, Z = 2.4) and low fragmentation (Intradaily Variability = 0.22, Z = -2.29), as well as appreciable amplitude (Amplitude Z = 1.72). The hourly heart-rate deviations exhibit a pronounced nocturnal dip (~-16 to -26 bpm below mesor during 1–7 AM) and a typical afternoon/evening peak (acrophase ~4:51 PM), consistent with a well-structured circadian profile. These circadian/physiological features generally correlate with better PSQI in the sample (small negative correlations for amplitude and stability).

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
Taken together, the strongest signals favor relatively good or at least average sleep quality. Objective metrics show adequate total sleep time and low variability across nights, and the heart-rate based circadian measures indicate a stable, high-amplitude rhythm with low fragmentation—features typically associated with lower (better) PSQI scores. Psychologically, the near-absence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and low stress further support better subjective sleep. Potential countervailing concerns are the late median bedtime (~1:00 AM) and extensive evening sedentary/screen-based activities, which are risk factors for worse subjective sleep quality or sleep latency issues; additionally, a slightly elevated mesor and modestly higher resting HR (RHR = 62.4, Z = 0.51) have small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample. However, these risks appear secondary relative to the combination of stable sleep duration, low variability, robust circadian structure, and minimal affective symptoms.

Conclusion regarding PSQI group:
Considering the balance of evidence—objective sleep duration and regularity near or better than sample means, strong circadian stability and amplitude, and very low depression/anxiety/stress—the participant most likely falls in the lower half of the study distribution for PSQI (i.e., better-than-median or average sleep quality). The behavioral risks (late timing, high evening screen time, low exercise) could increase vulnerability but do not outweigh the prominent signals of good sleep quantity/regularity and favorable psychological profile.

69057,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"The participant’s self-report profile indicates elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress alongside generally modest depressive symptoms and self-regard. The trait anxiety score (STAI = 53, Z = +1.16) and perceived stress (Score = 26, Z = +1.19) are both above the sample mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (STAI r ≈ 0.40, CES-D r ≈ 0.49 for depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms themselves are not markedly elevated (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14), and self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES score = 35, Z ≈ -0.45). The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (3+ times/week, Z ≈ +1.07), low-to-moderate alcohol use (1–2 times/month), and minimal non-prescribed drug use; these behavioral factors are generally neutral to slightly protective for sleep in this population, but their correlations with PSQI are small.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac metrics show features consistent with a relatively pronounced physiologic day–night contrast but reduced circadian regularity. The mesor (mean level) of heart rate is substantially lower than the study average (Mesor = 57.9, Z = -2.19), and resting heart rate is low (43.6 bpm, Z = -1.73), patterns that often reflect higher cardiovascular fitness. Amplitude is reduced (Z ≈ -0.68), and nonparametric circadian stability measures are below or near average (interdaily stability 0.32, Z ≈ -0.74; autocorrelation at 24 h Z ≈ -0.53), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.60, Z ≈ +0.39). Together these suggest lower day-to-day regularity of activity/physiology and modest within-day fragmentation, which in prior work tends to relate to poorer sleep consolidation and sleep quality.

Sleep timing and duration characteristics indicate objectively short and late main sleep periods with moderate night-to-night variability. Median nightly sleep duration from the wearable is ~5 hours 35 minutes (Z = -1.99), indicating substantially shorter sleep than the study mean. Median sleep start time is late (02:08 AM), consistent with an evening chronotype, and sleep duration variability is relatively high (SD ≈ 122 minutes, Z ≈ +0.49). Sleep start time is moderately consistent (start-time SD Z ≈ -0.66), but the combination of chronically late bedtimes and short overall sleep opportunity is a primary behavioral contributor to reduced sleep quantity. Hourly heart rate deviations show the expected nocturnal declines (large negative deviations across 2–6 AM) but some evening and late-night elevations (e.g., 12–1 AM positive deviation), which could reflect evening arousal or activity prior to the participant’s habitual sleep onset.

Integrating the multimodal evidence with respect to PSQI-relevant risk and protective factors: the strongest indicators pointing toward poorer sleep quality are the short median sleep duration (almost 2 standard deviations below the sample mean), late sleep timing (median start ~2:08 AM), elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress (both > +1 SD), and reduced interdaily circadian stability. Protective signals that could favor better PSQI are frequent exercise and low substance misuse, and low resting heart rate (fitness). However, given the substantial deficit in nightly sleep duration combined with late timing and psychosocial stress/anxiety—which are correlated with worse PSQI in this dataset—the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant is more likely to have a relatively poor overall sleep quality compared with the study population average.

64232,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile: On self-report measures the participant shows a mixed profile of moderate psychosocial stress and activity. Trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) and perceived stress (Score = 27, Z = 1.47) are elevated relative to the study sample, while depressive symptom burden is near the sample mean (CES-D = 13, Z = -0.03). Self-reported happiness is somewhat below average (Z = -0.53) and self-esteem is near average (Z = -0.17). The participant reports frequent organized physical activity (sports three times per week, Z = 1.58) but also reports alcohol use at a weekly frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) and notably higher relative endorsement of recreational drugs (1–2×/month, Z = 3.52). Where available, correlations with PSQI indicate that higher depressive symptoms and trait anxiety are associated with worse PSQI scores (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), so the elevated stress/anxiety signal is relevant to subjective sleep quality.

Behavioral sleep patterns from wearables and self-report: The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours (Z = 1.01), which is longer than the sample mean, but night-to-night variability is notable: sleep duration standard deviation is elevated (136 minutes, Z = 0.79) and bedtime variability is pronounced (sleep start time SD = 150 minutes, Z = 1.48). Median sleep start time is around 00:40, indicating a typical late-night sleep onset. Napping is essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Taken together, objective duration is adequate on average, but the substantial variability in both start time and duration implies irregular timing of sleep across the recording period, a pattern that commonly undermines consolidated, restorative sleep despite sufficient total hours.

Circadian and heart-rate–derived markers: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian features indicate a relatively weak and irregular daily structure. Interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = -1.56), autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (0.26, Z = -0.53), and amplitude is near-sample-average (amplitude = 10.24, Z = -0.17). Resting heart rate and mesor are slightly above average (RHR = 59.4 bpm, Z = 0.15; MESOR = 77.33, Z = 0.46). Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline in heart rate (large negative deviations between ~1–4 AM) consistent with sleep, and daytime/evening positive deviations with peaks in the evening (notable positive deviations around 8–10 PM). The combination of low interdaily stability and a preserved nocturnal HR trough suggests that although the participant typically attains physiological rest during sleep episodes, the timing of those episodes shifts across days and the overall daily schedule is irregular.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): The participant presents a mixed set of indicators. Objective quantity of sleep is ample (median = 8 h) and physiological sleep signatures (strong overnight HR reduction) are present, which are features associated with better sleep. Offsetting these positives are elevated stress and trait anxiety (both associated with worse subjective sleep), substantial variability in sleep timing and duration (high SDs and low interdaily stability), and weekly alcohol plus elevated recreational drug use relative to the sample — behaviors that can fragment sleep or worsen perceived sleep quality. Correlations in the study show that affective symptoms (CES-D, STAI) and variability measures have positive associations with PSQI; here those contributors (stress/anxiety, irregular timing) are meaningfully present. On balance, the evidence indicates that despite adequate mean sleep time, the irregular schedule, psychosocial stress, and substance-use patterns make it more likely the participant reports worse sleep quality compared with the median participant.

Final classification: top half of PSQI (worse sleep quality)

37404,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Participant profile and self-report indicators:
The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 35, Z = -0.62), with self-esteem near the sample mean (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03). Stress and health-satisfaction scores are close to the cohort average (stress Z ≈ -0.17, health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.13). Academic performance is strong (GPA ≈ 3.75–3.8 across terms). Alcohol use is modestly elevated for wine/liquor (1–2×/week, Z = 0.94) while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Regular exercise is reported (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07). Overall, subjective psychological and lifestyle indicators suggest relatively healthy mood and adaptive behaviors that, in isolation, would be expected to support typical or somewhat favorable sleep quality rather than pronounced sleep complaints.

Sleep timing and quantity (Fitbit + self-report):
Wearable-derived sleep duration is close to the cohort average, with a median nightly sleep of about 7 hours 9 minutes (Z ≈ -0.04). Night-to-night variability in total sleep (SD ≈ 66 minutes, Z ≈ -0.78) and in sleep start time (SD ≈ 65 minutes, Z ≈ -0.39) are below the sample mean, indicating moderately consistent sleep duration and timing compared with peers. Median sleep onset near 00:48 is consistent with a late-evening/early-night schedule typical in student samples but is not extreme. Napping is effectively absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z ≈ -0.86). Taken together, objective sleep quantity and intra-individual regularity metrics suggest reasonably adequate and stable sleep duration rather than marked sleep restriction or pervasive variability.

Circadian structure and cardiac physiology:
Circadian summary metrics derived from heart rate indicate a relatively weak and less-structured 24-hour rhythm. Interdaily stability is low (IS = 0.22, Z ≈ -1.56) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is reduced (Z ≈ -1.54), indicating that the timing and day-to-day repeatability of the participant’s rest–activity/heart rate rhythm are lower than typical in the sample. Intradaily variability is elevated (IV = 0.74, Z ≈ 1.37), consistent with greater fragmentation or intra-day switching between activity/rest states. Cosinor amplitude is also reduced (amplitude = 6.01, Z ≈ -1.54), which, together with a normative mesor and a typical evening acrophase (~5:32 PM), points to blunted day–night contrast in cardiac activity despite preserved overall timing of the circadian peak. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations ~3–6 AM) and daytime/evening positive deviations, but the relatively low amplitude metric implies that the day–night difference is smaller than in many peers. Resting heart rate is within a typical range (≈60.8 bpm, Z ≈ 0.32). These circadian features collectively indicate physiologic rhythm irregularity and some fragmentation, which can negatively influence subjective sleep quality and alertness even when total sleep time is adequate.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI-relevant inference):
Multiple data streams present a mixed but overall modestly favorable sleep profile. Objective sleep duration and low nap frequency, relatively low night-to-night variability, and absence of significant mood disturbance or high stress are features more commonly associated with average-to-good PSQI scores (i.e., lower/worse PSQI values). Counterbalancing those positive indicators are the wearable-derived circadian rhythm signs of reduced interdaily stability, elevated intradaily variability, and blunted amplitude—features that are typically associated with greater sleep fragmentation, poorer perceived sleep quality, and increased likelihood of sleep-related complaints. Correlations provided in the dataset show moderate associations between mood measures (CES-D, STAI) and PSQI, but the participant’s mood scores are low; circadian feature correlations with PSQI are small in magnitude. Given the stronger evidence for adequate sleep duration, low napping, and generally healthy self-report mood and activity behaviors, together with only moderate circadian irregularity that may not be large enough to drive severe subjective sleep problems on its own, the balance of evidence favors a PSQI in the lower half of the cohort distribution (i.e., relatively better/average sleep quality).

70492,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports elevated symptoms of psychological distress that are relevant to sleep. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) are both above the study mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.49 and r ≈ 0.40, respectively), indicating that higher mood and anxiety symptom burden would be expected to co-occur with worse sleep quality. Self‑esteem is modestly below average (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59), and perceived stress is relatively high (Stress = 25, Z = 0.92), further aligning with factors that commonly degrade subjective sleep. Lifestyle items show low physical-activity engagement (exercise and sports Z-scores around -1.1 to -1.2) and above-average time in sedentary hobbies and online/social activities (sedentary hobby Z = 1.41; socializing Z = 0.95; internet Z = 0.85). Alcohol use is modestly elevated for beer (1–2×/week, Z = 1.01) and non-prescribed drug usage contains an outlying Z value in the file (Z = 6.84) that appears inconsistent with the reported frequency and should be treated as a likely data anomaly rather than strong behavioral evidence.

Objective circadian and autonomic signals: Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a generally preserved but somewhat blunted heart-rate rhythm. The cosinor MESOR (69.5 bpm, Z = -0.60) and amplitude (9.4, Z = -0.44) are below the study mean, and resting heart rate is relatively low (53.6 bpm, Z = -0.54), consistent with a lower average daytime cardiovascular level but reduced day–night amplitude. Non‑parametric measures show modest interdaily stability (0.43, Z = 0.17) and low intradaily variability (0.54, Z = -0.04), suggesting moderate day‑to‑day regularity without pronounced fragmentation of activity patterns. Hourly aggregated heart‑rate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–8:00 AM) and a daytime peak around noon–early afternoon (+8 to +14 bpm), a conventional phase pattern with an acrophase near 5:12 PM. Overall these profiles reflect a physiologically normal day–night heart rate cycle but with somewhat attenuated amplitude.

Sleep timing, duration, and night‑to‑night variability: Median nightly sleep duration is near the population mean (7 h 5 min; Z = -0.13), indicating adequate total sleep on average. However, timing and stability of sleep are prominent concerns. The median sleep start time is very late (≈03:03), and the standard deviation of sleep start time is elevated (138 minutes, Z = 1.21), indicating frequent night‑to‑night shifts in sleep onset. Nightly sleep duration variability is notably high (SD = 222 minutes, Z = 2.75), meaning the participant’s sleep length varies widely across recorded nights. The participant reports essentially no naps. The combination of late average bedtime and large variability in both timing and duration typically undermines consolidated, restorative sleep and is often associated with poorer subjective sleep quality even when mean duration appears sufficient.

Integrated interpretation relative to PSQI: Several converging signals point toward relatively poorer sleep quality. Psychological factors linked to worse sleep — elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and perceived stress — are present and have moderate correlations with PSQI in this sample. Behavioral patterns that commonly impair sleep (infrequent exercise, elevated sedentary and online/social time late in the day, and a late median sleep onset) are evident. Wearable physiology does not show strong circadian fragmentation, but it does show reduced amplitude and a late nocturnal schedule, consistent with the late sleep timing. The most salient objective predictor here is the very high night‑to‑night variability in sleep duration (Z = 2.75) and elevated variability in sleep onset (Z = 1.21), both of which have positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset and are robust predictors of worse subjective sleep. Taken together — late and irregular sleep timing, high variability in duration, and elevated mood/stress/anxiety measures — the totality of evidence favors placement in the higher (worse) half of the PSQI distribution rather than the lower (better) half.

95543,3.0,0.015706806282722512,"The self-report profile indicates a broadly low symptom burden and a positive psychosocial state that, on balance, would be expected to support relatively good sleep. Depressive symptom burden is very low (CES-D Z = -1.28) and trait anxiety is low (STAI Z = -1.81); both measures have positive correlations with PSQI in the cohort (CES-D r = 0.49, STAI r = 0.40), meaning lower scores on these scales are associated with better sleep in this sample. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are elevated (SelfEsteem Z = 1.52; Happy Z = 1.64) and perceived health satisfaction is high (Z = 1.3); these variables are negatively correlated with PSQI in the cohort, consistent with a psychosocial profile that typically accompanies lower PSQI scores. Lifestyle factors further support favorable sleep propensity: no reported alcohol or recreational drug use, regular group exercise (Z = 1.23), and no napping (wearable naps Z = -0.86). Taken together, the survey and lifestyle data provide convergent evidence that psychological distress and common behavioral risk factors for poor sleep are minimal for this participant.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a relatively robust, regular circadian structure with a modestly elevated overall cardiovascular setpoint. Nonparametric and cosinor-derived rhythm measures indicate above-average temporal regularity: interdaily stability (0.54, Z = 1.08) and autocorrelation at 24 h (0.51, Z = 1.57) are both higher than the population mean, while intradaily variability is near average (Z = -0.11). Cosinor parameters show a clear rhythm (mesor 82.9, Z = 1.22; amplitude 13.2, Z = 0.78) with an acrophase in the early evening (6:35 PM), consistent with higher daytime/evening cardiovascular activation and lower overnight values. Resting heart rate is modestly elevated relative to peers (66.7 bpm, Z = 1.02). Hourly aggregate deviations from mesor reveal the expected nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and pronounced evening elevations (largest positive deviations between ~6–9 PM, with 8–9 PM Z = 2.09). These patterns indicate a stable, pronounced diurnal heart rate rhythm with relatively high evening physiological arousal and a somewhat higher baseline heart rate; however, the cohort correlations between most circadian/HR metrics and PSQI are small in magnitude, suggesting limited direct predictive weight from these features alone.

Objective sleep timing and duration metrics show a consistent late sleep schedule but adequate aggregate sleep quantity. Median sleep duration is about 7 hours 25 minutes (Z = 0.29), which is slightly above the cohort mean. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is lower than average (SD = 60 minutes, Z = -0.92), and sleep start time is consistently late (median sleep onset ~02:25 AM) with low variability (start time SD Z = -1.08). Napping is absent. The combination of consistent timing, low variability, and sufficient total duration suggests stable sleep behavior; the late chronotype (habitual ~2:25 AM sleep onset) could be relevant for social or academic functioning but, in isolation, does not imply poor sleep efficiency or short sleep in this case. Cohort correlations linking variability and late timing to PSQI are modest, and here variability is low which tends to favor better PSQI.

Integrative assessment weighing psychological, behavioral, and wearable evidence favors relatively good or average sleep quality in this participant. Strongest contributors toward a lower (better) PSQI are very low depressive and anxiety symptoms (both of which are the cohort variables most strongly correlated with PSQI), high self-reported happiness and health satisfaction, regular exercise, absence of substance use and napping, and a stable sleep schedule with adequate duration. Countervailing signals that could modestly elevate PSQI include the late habitual sleep onset and a slightly elevated resting/mean heart rate with pronounced evening autonomic activation; however, these features have only small cohort correlations with PSQI and are offset by low variability and good psychosocial functioning. On balance, the multimodal profile is more consistent with sleep quality in the lower half of the cohort PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good or average sleep), rather than the top half.

67106,6.0,0.387434554973822,"The participant’s self-report profile indicates low affective symptom burden and generally positive self-evaluation. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are very low (score = 2.0, Z = -1.18) and trait anxiety is likewise low (STAI = 29, Z = -1.22). Measures of positive functioning are elevated: self‑esteem is above the sample mean (RSES Z = 1.1) and current happiness is relatively high (score = 5.0, Z = 1.64). Health satisfaction is also above average (Z = 1.47). Substance use is essentially absent and engagement in many social and recreational activities is minimal (large negative Z-scores for socializing, internet use, and exercise), suggesting a lifestyle with low substance-related sleep risk but also limited social/leisure time. Taken together, these psychosocial features are more consistent with lower vulnerability to sleep disturbance rather than with widespread subjective sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a robust and regular daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is high (0.64, Z = 1.90) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.57, Z = 2.07), indicating consistent day-to-day patterning of heart-rate–based activity across the recording period. The mesor (mean heart rate) and resting heart rate are modestly below the population mean (mesor 72.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.21; resting HR 56.3 bpm, Z ≈ -0.22), and the amplitude of the fitted rhythm is slightly elevated (12.6, Z = 0.59), consistent with a clear day–night contrast. Hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal decreases in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and clear daytime/evening increases; notable positive deviations occur in the early evening (6–9 PM; e.g., 6–7 PM = +18.4 bpm, Z = 1.02; 8–9 PM = +16.5 bpm, Z = 1.21). Overall, these features indicate physiologic quiescence at night and a stable circadian organization, both of which are typically associated with better sleep consolidation.

Objective and subjective sleep timing and quantity present a mixed pattern. Median nightly sleep duration derived from the wearable is 6 hours 46 minutes (Z = -0.51), which is modestly below the study mean and below typical recommended sleep length for young adults. The median sleep start time is late (about 01:29 AM), and night-to-night variability is moderate (sleep duration SD ≈ 98 minutes, sleep start SD ≈ 88 minutes). The participant takes very few naps (mean daily naps ≈ 0.12). The combination of late bedtimes and sub‑7 hour median sleep duration could increase risk for poorer subjective sleep quality, but the relatively high interdaily stability and low physiologic resting heart rate argue for consolidated sleep periods when they occur. Correlations in the sample indicate that depressive and anxious symptoms are associated with worse PSQI scores, but this participant’s depressive and anxiety scores are low; conversely, features that in the sample modestly predict worse PSQI (e.g., short sleep duration) are present but not extreme.

Integrating psychosocial, wearable circadian, and sleep-timing data yields a predominantly favorable signal regarding global sleep quality. The participant exhibits low affective symptomatology, high self-reported well-being, strong and regular circadian structure, and physiologic indicators consistent with good nocturnal quiescence; these characteristics favor lower (better) PSQI scores. Countervailing evidence includes a relatively late median sleep onset and a median sleep duration slightly below 7 hours with some night-to-night variability, which could modestly elevate subjective sleep disturbance. On balance, the convergent evidence—particularly low depression/anxiety, high interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation, and low resting heart rate—supports placement in the lower half of the study PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively better sleep quality).

83612,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 58; Z = 1.65), a signal that chronic anxiety proneness is substantially higher than the study mean and is one of the strongest psychological risk markers in the profile. Depressive symptoms on the CES-D are in the mild-to-moderate range (CESD = 15; Z = 0.18) but not in a clinical range per the provided classification; nevertheless, CES-D score shows a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.49), indicating depressive symptom burden is a likely contributor to sleep disturbance. Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES = 29; Z = -1.29), and trust is reduced (Z ≈ -1.1); both of these trait-level features have modest correlations with worse PSQI in the dataset (self-esteem r ≈ -0.36, trust r ≈ -0.21). Reported stress is modestly elevated (Score = 23; Z = 0.38). Substance use is low and exercise is limited but present (roughly 1–2 times per week), suggesting few behavioral risk factors from alcohol/drugs and modest protective influence from some physical activity.

Sleep behavior and subjective/objective sleep metrics:
Wearable-derived sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 42 minutes (Z = -0.59), indicating somewhat shorter sleep than the study mean but not extremely short. Median sleep start time is around 00:51 (± ~84 minutes), indicating a habitual late-night sleep onset. Night-to-night variability of total sleep duration is moderate (SD ≈ 67 minutes; Z = -0.76), which is slightly lower than the population on average and thus not a prominent source of instability. The participant reports essentially no daytime napping. Correlational helpers show that sleep duration itself has only a small direct relation to PSQI here (r ≈ 0.05), while variability in sleep timing has a modest positive association with PSQI (sleep start time SD r ≈ 0.18); the participant’s timing variability is near the sample mean.

Circadian and physiological patterns from wearable data:
Heart-rate derived circadian metrics indicate reduced circadian regularity and structure. Interdaily stability is low (0.28; Z = -1.07), indicating day-to-day inconsistency in the timing or amplitude of the heart-rate rhythm, while intradaily variability is elevated (0.70; Z = 1.09), reflecting greater fragmentation or within-day fluctuations. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.17; Z = -1.29), and amplitude is moderately reduced (Amplitude = 9.31; Z = -0.48). Mesor (≈70 bpm) and resting heart rate (54.6 bpm; Z = -0.42) are on the lower side of the population. Hourly aggregate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations in the early morning hours) and daytime increases with notable peaks in mid-afternoon and at 9–10 pm (9–10 pm deviation Z = 1.33), suggesting periods of elevated physiological arousal in the evening. Taken together, these circadian features—reduced interdaily stability, increased intradaily variability, and blunted amplitude—are consistent with a less robust, more irregular circadian organization of arousal, which epidemiologically and mechanistically tends to coincide with poorer subjective sleep quality.

Integration and interpretation relevant to PSQI:
Key indicators that point toward poorer PSQI (higher/worse scores) include markedly elevated trait anxiety (strongly associated with worse PSQI in this sample), moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D correlates moderately with PSQI), low self-esteem (negatively correlated with sleep quality), and wearable-derived circadian instability (low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability). Evening increases in heart-rate deviation (notably around 9–10 pm) combined with a late typical sleep onset (≈00:51) suggest evening arousal that may impede sleep consolidation even though median sleep duration is only modestly reduced. Offsetting signals that could point toward better or average sleep quality are low substance use, no daytime naps, some regular exercise, relatively low resting heart rate, and a sleep-duration variability that is not excessive. However, these protective factors appear secondary relative to the stronger psychological risk signals (especially trait anxiety) and the objective circadian fragmentation measures.

PSQI group classification:
Weighing the evidence — prominent trait anxiety (STAI Z = 1.65) with known moderate correlation to PSQI, moderate depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, reduced interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythms, and signs of evening physiological arousal combined with a late habitual sleep time — the overall pattern is more consistent with relatively poorer global sleep quality compared with the study population. Although sleep duration is only modestly below average and some health behaviors are protective, the constellation of psychological risk and circadian irregularity more strongly predicts elevated PSQI. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the higher-PSQI half of the study distribution (worse sleep quality).

92566,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report measures consistently indicate low psychological distress and generally positive well-being. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71) are well below the study mean, and current happiness and health satisfaction are elevated (happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 1.22). Self-esteem is relatively high compared with the sample (RSES Z = 1.38). These trait and state indicators are all in the directions typically associated with more favorable subjective sleep (many of these scales show moderate correlations with PSQI in this dataset), suggesting the participant is unlikely to experience major mood- or anxiety-related sleep disturbance during the recording period.

Lifestyle, behaviors, and daytime activity:
Reported lifestyle behaviors are consistent with a health-oriented profile. The participant exercises frequently (exercised alone three times per week or more; exercise frequency Z = 1.07), has low use of recreational drugs and modest alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week), and reports modest daytime screen time and limited sedentary hobby engagement. Socializing (2–3 hours/day, Z = 0.95) and reading time are somewhat above average. Low napping frequency (mean daily naps 0.07, Z = -0.08) and low recreational drug use further reduce common behavioral contributors to poor nocturnal sleep. Overall, daytime routines and health-related behaviors would be expected to support reasonably stable sleep for many people.

Wearable-derived circadian and autonomic metrics:
Heart rate–based circadian measures show a relatively typical and reasonably regular daily pattern. Parametric cosinor values (MESOR ~71.4 bpm, Z = -0.35; amplitude ~11.1 bpm, Z = 0.09) and a late-afternoon acrophase (~4:17 PM) indicate a clear daytime elevation and nighttime nadir in heart rate. Resting heart rate is low (49.05 bpm, Z = -1.08), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and often associated with better sleep quality. Nonparametric rhythm measures (interdaily stability 0.40, intradaily variability 0.52) are near the cohort mean (Z-scores close to zero) and do not signal pronounced fragmentation or irregularity of the circadian cardiac rhythm. Hourly aggregate deviations show large negative deviations overnight (e.g., -23 to -27 bpm between ~2–5 AM) and large positive deviations in late afternoon/early evening, consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest and robust daytime activity; these patterns are physiologically consistent with consolidated sleep episodes rather than highly fragmented or physiologically aroused nocturnal states.

Objective sleep timing and variability:
Fitbit-derived sleep statistics show shorter than average nightly duration but evidence of consolidated nocturnal sleep. Median sleep duration is 6 hours 17 minutes (Z = -1.11), indicating the participant sleeps somewhat less than the study mean. Median sleep start time is around 00:48 (late evening), with a moderate night-to-night variability in sleep start (SD ~113 minutes, Z = 0.66) and sleep duration variability (SD 120 minutes, Z = 0.43). These variability measures have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample, suggesting that irregularity in sleep timing could contribute to poorer subjective sleep. However, low nap frequency, strong overnight heart rate suppression, and lack of wearable-detected circadian fragmentation argue that sleep is typically consolidated when it occurs.

Integrated interpretation with respect to PSQI:
Weighing the multimodal evidence yields an overall picture of generally good psychological well-being and physiologic signs of consolidated nocturnal rest, contrasted with somewhat short average sleep duration and modest night-to-night timing variability. Psychological indicators that most strongly correlate with worse PSQI in this sample (depression and trait anxiety) are low for this participant, and resting heart rate and circadian amplitude are favorable—both factors that typically align with lower PSQI scores. The most direct objective markers that might elevate PSQI are the relatively short median sleep duration (~6h17m, Z = -1.11) and moderate variability in sleep timing and duration (sleep start SD and duration SD slightly above average), which are associated (albeit modestly) with worse PSQI in the cohort. On balance, the preponderance of evidence — low mood/anxiety/stress, high self-reported well-being, low resting heart rate, consolidated nocturnal HR nadir, low napping, and absence of notable circadian fragmentation — points toward relatively favorable overall sleep quality compared with the study population despite somewhat reduced total sleep time.

PSQI group conclusion:
Given the combination of protective psychological and physiological signals and only modest negative indicators (shorter median sleep and some variability), the most parsimonious classification is that this participant’s PSQI score would fall in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively better/average sleep quality).

35987,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate a mixed psychological profile with elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 51; Z ≈ +0.96) alongside relatively low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 10; Z ≈ -0.34). Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 28; Z ≈ -1.43) and general satisfaction with physical health is lower than average (health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95). Reported stress is near the cohort median. These trait-level features that most strongly covary with poorer sleep in this sample are the elevated trait anxiety (moderate positive correlation with PSQI ~0.40) and lower self-esteem (negative correlation with PSQI ~ -0.35, i.e., lower self-esteem associates with worse PSQI). Overall, the psychological profile suggests higher anxiety-proneness and lower self-regard that could plausibly contribute to disturbed sleep quality through cognitive-emotional arousal.

Sleep timing and duration (wearable + self-report): Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 32 minutes (Z ≈ -0.81), shorter than the study average, with low night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 56 minutes; Z ≈ -1.02) and essentially no naps. The participant’s median sleep start time is very late (approximately 2:45 AM) with moderate night-to-night consistency (start-time SD ≈ 54 minutes; Z ≈ -0.64). Shorter-than-average total sleep time combined with a chronically delayed sleep period is a pattern commonly associated with increased sleep complaints and daytime impairment even when duration variability is low. In this dataset, sleep duration has a small positive correlation with PSQI (≈0.05), but late and irregular timing and pre-sleep arousal typically relate to higher PSQI in comparable cohorts.

Physiological circadian and cardiac indicators: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian features show a relatively robust, regular rhythm in heart-rate measures: interdaily stability is high (0.62; Z ≈ +1.74), amplitude is elevated (14.36; Z ≈ +1.16), and mesor is modestly above average (78.05 bpm; Z ≈ +0.56). Resting heart rate is low-normal (57.2 bpm; Z ≈ -0.11). High interdaily stability and substantive amplitude indicate a preserved day–night organization of cardiac activity across days, a pattern that often corresponds with better objective circadian entrainment and sometimes better subjective sleep. However, intradaily variability is elevated (0.66; Z ≈ +0.81), signaling more fragmentation within days.

Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show a pronounced pattern of elevated cardiovascular activity in the late evening and around typical pre-sleep hours (notable positive deviations with large Z-scores at ~9–11 PM and around midnight) and strong negative deviations in early morning hours (large drops around 4–7 AM). The elevated late-evening heart rate contrasts with the very late sleep onset and suggests physiologic or behavioral arousal in the hours preceding sleep (e.g., electronic media use, social/consumptive behaviors, or residual activity). These late-evening elevations in heart rate and the relatively high intradaily variability are consistent with difficulty winding down and can contribute to poorer perceived sleep quality.

Behavioral contributors: The participant reports minimal exercise and no regular sports participation (very low exercise Z-scores), moderate screen-based leisure (TV and internet use above average), and modest alcohol use (beer 1–2 times per week). Low physical activity plus evening screen time and episodic alcohol use can each individually and additively impact sleep onset and subjective sleep quality. The combination of little daytime physical activity and high evening physiological activity provides a plausible behavioral pathway for late sleep timing and pre-sleep arousal.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality (PSQI implications): The profile is mixed. Protective features include a relatively consistent daily rhythm (high interdaily stability), elevated rhythm amplitude, low resting heart rate, and low night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration—factors that can support more consolidated sleep. Countervailing and more salient risk features for poorer sleep are the late median sleep onset (~2:45 AM), objectively short median sleep duration (~6.5 hours), elevated late-evening heart rate deviations indicating pre-sleep arousal, elevated intradaily variability, and higher trait anxiety (which has a moderate positive correlation with worse PSQI). Given that several of the variables most strongly correlated with PSQI in this sample (trait anxiety, depressive symptoms when present, and evening arousal indicators) point toward greater sleep disturbance, and considering the participant’s objectively late sleep timing and suboptimal duration, the balance of evidence favors a higher PSQI (worse sleep quality) relative to the cohort median.

79341,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports a low level of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) alongside a trait anxiety score in the mid-range (STAI = 41, Z ≈ -0.03). Self-esteem is high (RSES = 39) while momentary happiness is relatively low (self-rated happiness Z = -1.61). Perceived stress is lower than the study mean (Z = -1.8). Substance use is minimal and physical health satisfaction is slightly below average. Overall, the profile shows more adaptive trait-level resources (high self-esteem, low depressive symptom burden, regular exercise) but some affective signals (elevated trait anxiety relative to sample mean and lower self-rated happiness) that can modestly influence sleep-related perceptions and arousal.

Behavioral sleep patterns and subjective sleep-relevant habits:
Wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 hours 46 minutes (Z = -0.51), with a median sleep start time near 01:50 AM and moderate night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 99 minutes; sleep-start SD ≈ 68 minutes). The participant reports essentially no daytime napping. Recreational patterns include above-average time spent on video games (Z = 1.71) and modest media usage, which, together with the late habitual sleep onset, represent behavioral factors that commonly relate to later sleep timing and modest reductions in total nocturnal sleep. These behavioral markers suggest a tendency toward late sleep timing and slightly shortened sleep opportunity relative to typical collegiate norms, which could contribute to subjective complaints about sleep quality in some individuals.

Physiological circadian and cardiovascular signatures:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate reasonably robust 24-hour organization: interdaily stability (0.52, Z = 0.91) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 0.98) are above-sample-average, indicating consistent day-to-day rhythm timing. The participant’s mesor and resting heart rate are low (mesor Z = -1.32, resting HR ≈ 48 bpm, Z = -1.18), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline: hourly deviations show marked negative offsets from mesor across the sleeping hours (largest around 4–5 AM). Daytime heart-rate deviations peak strongly around midday (12–1 PM, Z = 1.87). Intradaily variability is slightly above average (Z = 0.32), but overall the pattern is one of well-structured circadian physiology with a clear nocturnal dip and consistent daytime elevation—physiological features typically associated with consolidated sleep opportunity and stable circadian entrainment.

Integration and likely implications for PSQI (overall sleep quality):
The multimodal evidence is mixed but leans toward sleep within the average-to-better range for this population. Risk factors for elevated PSQI (worse sleep) include a habitual late sleep onset (≈ 01:50 AM), slightly reduced total sleep time relative to sample mean, and evening media/gaming behavior. Counterbalancing these, there are multiple protective indicators: low depressive symptom burden, low perceived stress, frequent exercise, minimal substance use, no napping, and a well-organized heart-rate circadian rhythm with a pronounced nocturnal dip and low resting heart rate. Correlational guidance in the dataset shows moderate relationships between depression/anxiety and PSQI, but this participant’s depression is low and anxiety only modestly elevated. On balance—given strong physiological rhythm regularity, lifestyle protections, and only modest deviation in sleep duration and timing—the preponderance of evidence suggests the participant’s overall PSQI is more consistent with the lower half (better/average sleep quality) of the study distribution rather than the top half.

83536,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and lifestyle profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 26, Z = -1.51), alongside above-average momentary happiness (self-report Z = 1.64) and high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = 1.3). Substance use is minimal (alcohol use below typical campus rates, no recreational/non-prescribed drug use) and social activity is moderate (2–3 hours socializing, Z = 0.95). Exercise is modest (exercising alone and with others 1–2 times/week). This constellation indicates relatively low affective burden and generally health-promoting behaviors that, in population studies, tend to be associated with better subjective sleep quality.

Reported sleep habits and sleep timing: Fitbit-derived sleep duration is in the adequate range, with a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 5 minutes (Z = -0.13), and no recorded naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Night-to-night sleep duration variability is not elevated (SD = 84 minutes, Z = -0.39). However, the participant’s median sleep start time is late (02:25 AM) with moderate variability in sleep onset (SD = 99 minutes, Z = 0.35). In sum, total sleep quantity is near or slightly better than the cohort average and napping is absent, but the timing of sleep is shifted late and somewhat variable, which can produce circadian misalignment effects even when overall duration is adequate.

Wearable-derived physiological and circadian features: Resting heart rate is relatively low (56.4 bpm, Z = -0.21) and the cosinor MESOR is 74.23 bpm (Z = 0.04), indicating generally low baseline cardiovascular tone. The modeled circadian amplitude is modest (10.55 bpm, Z = -0.07) and acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (≈5:12 PM). Nonparametric circadian measures show average interdaily stability (0.41, Z = 0.0) but somewhat elevated intradaily variability (0.65, Z = 0.74), suggesting more within-day fragmentation or irregularity in the heart-rate-derived activity signal. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations around 5–7 AM, ~-23 bpm from MESOR) and daytime/evening elevations (peak positive deviations in midday and early evening). There are noticeable positive deviations in the late evening hours (approximately 9–11 PM) relative to mesor; combined with a late sleep onset this pattern could reflect wakeful evening activity or physiological arousal prior to the participant’s delayed sleep period.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality (PSQI-related inference): Several lines of evidence support relatively good or at least average sleep quality: adequate median sleep duration (~7 h), low napping, low affective symptom burden, low stress and health satisfaction, and low substance use. These features typically correspond to lower (better) PSQI scores. Countervailing signals include a late and somewhat variable sleep onset (median 2:25 AM), modestly elevated intradaily variability (Z = 0.74) which can index fragmentation, and some evening heart-rate elevation that could indicate pre-sleep arousal for a person who delays sleep. Correlations between the available metrics and PSQI within this dataset are generally small. Balancing the stronger evidence for sufficient duration and low affective symptoms against the isolated markers of circadian delay and within-day irregularity, the overall pattern is more consistent with average-to-better-than-average sleep quality in this sample rather than clearly elevated PSQI. Therefore, on balance the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study distribution for PSQI (i.e., lower/worse PSQI scores are not supported; they likely have a relatively better/average PSQI).

67608,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and lifestyle profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 1, z = -1.28; STAI = 26, z = -1.51) and relatively high momentary well-being (self-reported happiness z = 1.64) and self-esteem (RSES z ≈ 0.96). Stress is near the sample mean (z ≈ -0.17). Health satisfaction and exercise frequency are above average (exercise alone three or more times per week, z = 1.07), and substance use is moderate (beer and liquor 1–2 times weekly, z ≈ 1.0). Daily sedentary recreational behaviors are minimal. Taken together, the self-report and behavioral lifestyle data indicate overall favorable psychological functioning, regular engagement in physical activity, and limited recreational or substance behaviors that would typically undermine sleep quality.

Wearable-derived sleep timing and duration: Nightly sleep metrics indicate a median sleep duration of about 7 hours 12 minutes (z = 0.02), with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 58 minutes, z = -0.98). The participant has a consistently late sleep onset (median start ≈ 01:14 AM) with low variability in start time (SD ≈ 26 minutes, z = -1.24), and minimal reliance on naps (mean daily naps 0.12, z = 0.61). These features show that although the participant keeps a late sleep schedule, it is stable across days and provides average total sleep time. Stability and low variability in timing and duration are generally associated with fewer sleep complaints even when timing is delayed.

Circadian and physiological signals: Cosinor and nonparametric circadian metrics show mixed signals. Interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.48, z = 0.58), consistent with a repeatable day-to-day pattern, while intradaily variability is elevated (0.77, z = 1.58), indicating relatively frequent transitions between activity and rest states within days. MESOR and resting heart rate are below the population mean (MESOR z = -0.78; resting HR 53.6 bpm, z = -0.54), consistent with lower overall cardiovascular arousal and likely higher fitness. Amplitude is slightly below average. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal declines (large negative deviations around 1–3 AM) and relatively large positive deviations in the evening (notably 8–9 PM, z = 2.32, and 10–11 PM, z = 1.49). This pattern suggests a physiological night-time quiescence that aligns with sleep, but also an evening period of elevated arousal/activity. Together these suggest a stable circadian mean with some intra-day fragmentation and evening activation.

Integration and implications for sleep quality: Multiple converging indicators point toward generally adequate sleep quantity and regularity: median sleep duration near the population mean, low night-to-night variability in both duration and start time, low nap use, and above-average interdaily stability. Favorable psychological traits (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem) and regular exercise further support relatively good subjective sleep quality. Countervailing signals include the consistently late sleep timing (bed around 1:14 AM) and elevated intradaily variability plus evening heart-rate elevations, which may reflect evening engagement or arousal that could contribute to sleep disturbance for some contexts (e.g., if early morning obligations exist). However, these countervailing factors do not appear to be accompanied by short sleep duration, high variability, or elevated mood symptoms that typically track with poor PSQI scores.

Conclusion regarding PSQI placement: On balance, the participant shows more indicators associated with relatively good or average sleep quality (adequate and consistent sleep duration, low variability, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, regular activity) than with profiles associated with high PSQI scores. Although the late sleep timing and some intra-day fragmentation introduce potential risk factors for worse subjective sleep, the overall pattern supports placement in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., better or average sleep quality).

19735,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and affective profile:
The participant reports a pronounced symptom burden on mood measures: a CES-D score of 34 (Z = 2.15) places them well above the cohort mean and indicates frequent depressive symptomatology over the prior week. Trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56), and self-esteem is comparatively lower than peers (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01). Self-reported happiness and trust are below the sample average (happiness Z = -0.53; trust Z = -1.10). These self-report features are relevant because depressive and anxious symptoms show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40), implying that higher affective symptom levels are associated with worse self-reported sleep quality in this sample.

Lifestyle and behavioral context:
The participant’s daytime routines indicate relatively low social and recreational engagement (socializing Z = -2.20; internet and media use minimal), limited group exercise (exercised with others: not at all, Z = -1.58), and modest individual exercise (1–2x/week). Substance use is present at low-to-moderate frequency for alcohol (beer and wine 1–2x/week, Z ≈ 1.0) and recreational drugs reported at 1–2x/month with a high Z-score (Z = 3.52), although the correlation of these specific uses with PSQI is small in this sample. Overall, the lifestyle profile suggests fewer social supports and irregular social/leisure rhythms, which can contribute to subjective sleep disturbance and reduced daytime recovery, particularly in the context of elevated mood symptoms.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac physiology:
Heart-rate based circadian metrics show a robust amplitude (amplitude = 14.29, Z = 1.13) and a daytime acrophase around 5:26 PM, with mesor near the population mean (75.1, Z = 0.16). Resting heart rate is relatively low (50.3 bpm, Z = -0.93), consistent with good cardiovascular conditioning. Interdaily stability is near average (0.42, Z = 0.09) and intradaily variability is slightly lower than the cohort mean (0.51, Z = -0.25), while autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively low (0.21, Z = -0.95), indicating modest consistency in daily heart rate patterns across days. Hourly mean deviations from mesor show expected large negative deviations overnight (big drops between ~3–7 AM) and positive deviations across the afternoon and early evening, consistent with nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation during sleep and daytime activation. Collectively, these wearable signatures indicate physiologically deep and consolidated nocturnal cardiac downregulation on average, and a pronounced day–night amplitude.

Objective sleep timing and variability:
Nightly sleep duration is comparatively healthy by duration: median sleep of 7 hours 48 minutes (Z = 0.77) and very low mean daily napping (0.08 naps/day). However, sleep timing is late: the median sleep start time is roughly 02:01 AM, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is non-trivial (SD = 112 minutes, Z = 0.25). Sleep start time variability is moderate (SD = 77 minutes). These features indicate that although aggregated sleep duration is adequate, sleep opportunity is centered late at night/early morning and shows variability across nights—factors that can impair subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning despite preserved total sleep time.

Synthesis regarding sleep quality (PSQI) and final assessment:
There are mixed objective and subjective indicators. Objective wearable physiology (robust nocturnal heart rate decline, adequate median sleep duration) suggests relatively preserved sleep consolidation and restorative physiological sleep. In contrast, the participant’s pronounced depressive symptoms and elevated trait anxiety—measures that correlate moderately with PSQI in this cohort—along with late habitual sleep timing and measurable night-to-night variability, are consistent with greater subjective sleep disturbance. Because the PSQI is a self-report measure and correlates strongly here with depressive symptomatology, the high CES-D score and elevated anxiety weigh importantly toward higher (worse) PSQI. Balancing the physiological evidence of adequate duration and nocturnal cardiac downregulation against the strong affective symptom burden and circadian timing concerns, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep quality) in this study population.

59207,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and self-report profile: On standardized mood and trait measures the participant reports relatively low affective risk: CES-D score of 10 (Z = -0.34) and STAI-T score of 37 (Z = -0.43) are both below sample means and are classified as “not depressed” and “not anxious.” Self‑esteem and health satisfaction are above average (self‑esteem Z = 0.68; health satisfaction Z = 1.3), and stress and trust are near or slightly below sample averages. Daily activities show frequent exercise (exercised alone three times a week or more; exercise Z ≈ 1.07) and minimal use of non‑prescribed drugs; alcohol use is present (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) and video gaming time is elevated (Z = 2.47). Correlational estimates in the dataset indicate that depressive and trait anxiety scores are among the stronger individual predictors of PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.49 and 0.40, respectively), but the participant’s scores on those measures are relatively low, which argues against major mood‑related drivers of poor sleep for this individual.

Objective sleep patterns from the wearable: Nightly sleep duration is long on average, with a median duration of about 8 hours 13 minutes (Z = 1.28), and the participant reports no habitual napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). However, there is substantial night‑to‑night variability: sleep duration standard deviation is large (169 minutes, Z = 1.55) and sleep start time is late (median 01:34:59) with high variability in start time (SD ≈ 141 minutes, Z = 1.27). The combination of above‑average total sleep time and large inter‑night variability plus late bedtimes suggests that while total sleep quantity is generally adequate, sleep timing is erratic and biased toward late nocturnal onset — a pattern that can impair subjective sleep continuity or daytime functioning even when total duration is sufficient.

Circadian and physiological activity features: Heart‑rate derived circadian rhythm metrics point to a pronounced and regular diurnal pattern. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.56, Z = 1.24) and intradaily variability is low (0.25, Z = -2.08), indicating a consolidated and consistent rhythm across days with relatively little fragmentation within days. Amplitude is above average (14.04, Z = 1.05) and the cosinor MESOR is near sample mean (MESOR ≈ 76.4, Z = 0.34); the acrophase is in the early evening (about 5:58 PM), and resting heart rate is modest (61.4 bpm, Z = 0.39). Hourly aggregated deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal nadir (largest negative deviations roughly 2–7 AM, down ~15–21 bpm) and daytime elevations in the afternoon/evening. Overall, the wearable physiology suggests stable and robust daytime–nighttime separation in cardiovascular arousal, consistent with consolidated sleep episodes despite the late timing.

Behavioral context and integration: Protective behavioral features include regular daytime structure (high interdaily stability), frequent exercise, absence of napping, and low symptoms of depression and anxiety; these factors are typically associated with better subjective sleep quality. Conversely, elevated night‑to‑night variability in sleep timing and duration and consistently late bedtimes (median ~1:35 AM) represent risk factors for perceived poor sleep or daytime impairment and map onto behaviors that commonly degrade some PSQI domains (sleep timing, sleep efficiency, and daytime dysfunction). Correlations provided in the dataset show only small positive relationships between objective sleep variability and PSQI (r ≈ 0.18–0.20) and small relationships for resting heart rate and duration; the stronger sample‑level predictors (depression, trait anxiety) are not prominent for this participant.

Overall likelihood of PSQI group placement: Balancing the evidence, the profile leans toward relatively preserved sleep quality. The participant obtains above‑average total sleep time, shows strong and regular circadian organization from wearable heart‑rate data, reports low affective risk and engages in frequent exercise, and does not nap — all factors that would favor a lower (better) PSQI score. The principal countervailing evidence is late and variable sleep timing, which can increase subjective complaints and contribute to higher PSQI component scores, but the magnitude of those risks appears modest in this case and the dataset correlations linking timing variability to PSQI are small to moderate. On balance, the preponderance of objective and self‑report indicators suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the lower (better) half of the study distribution on overall PSQI.

96613,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Sleep timing and duration
The participant’s wearable-recorded sleep profile is characterized by long, consistent nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 29 minutes (Z = +1.61), well above the cohort mean, and night-to-night variability in sleep duration is modest (SD = 77 minutes; Z = -0.53). Bedtimes are late on average (median sleep start 01:31:30), but sleep onset is relatively stable (sleep start time SD = 34 minutes; Z = -1.06). Napping is infrequent (mean daily naps = 0.15; Z = +0.94). Taken together, the objective sleep metrics indicate robust total sleep time and consistent timing despite a delayed sleep schedule, which would generally support restorative sleep quantity even if the calendar hour of sleep onset is late.

Physiological sleep and nocturnal autonomic pattern
Heart-rate-derived nocturnal physiology shows pronounced decreases in mean heart rate during the typical sleep window: hourly deviations from the mesor fall substantially negative across the early morning hours (e.g., roughly -18 to -26 bpm between ~2:00–7:00 AM, Z-scores ranging from about -0.8 to -1.3). Resting heart rate is low (47.8 bpm, Z = -1.23), and mesor is also below the sample mean (67.6 bpm, Z = -0.86). These patterns—large nocturnal heart rate declines and low resting heart rate—are consistent with substantial parasympathetic predominance at night and a generally low cardiovascular arousal setpoint, both of which are commonly associated with higher sleep consolidation and physical fitness rather than fragmented sleep.

Circadian structure and daytime arousal
Circadian summary metrics indicate relatively strong amplitude (amplitude = 14.68, Z = +1.26) and modestly above-average interdaily stability (0.45, Z = +0.33), suggesting a well-structured 24-hour rhythm in heart rate. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.64, Z = +0.67), indicating some within-day fragmentation of activity or physiological state, but autocorrelation at 24 hours is near the sample average (Z ≈ -0.03). Hourly aggregate deviations show a clear daytime rise in heart rate with large positive deviations in the afternoon (peaking ~2–4 PM), consistent with consolidated daytime activity and a consolidated nocturnal rest phase. Overall, the circadian profile points to a strong amplitude, reasonably regular rhythm with some daytime/within-day variability but clear separation between active daytime and quiescent nighttime physiology.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle correlates
Self-report measures show low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72), both of which correlate positively with PSQI in the cohort; here the low values suggest fewer affective contributors to poor sleep. Self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average (self-esteem Z = +0.96; health satisfaction Z = +1.05). The participant reports regular social exercise (exercising with others three or more times per week; Z = +1.23) and moderate beer consumption (1–2 times per week; Z = +1.01). Leisure patterns include some sedentary hobby time (Z = +1.41) but modest screen and recreational use. These behavioral and affective features—regular social physical activity, low mood/anxiety, and good health satisfaction—are generally consistent with better subjective and objective sleep outcomes in young adult samples.

Integrated interpretation relative to PSQI-relevant domains
Objective sleep quantity is ample and stable, nocturnal autonomic suppression is pronounced, circadian amplitude and interdaily regularity are relatively strong, and affective/lifestyle indicators are favorable. The only notable caveats are the delayed average bedtime (~01:30 AM) and a modestly elevated intraday variability metric; however, the participant’s sleep timing is consistent across days and does not appear to compromise total sleep time or nocturnal autonomic recovery. Correlational directions in the dataset (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms positively correlated with worse PSQI; higher amplitude and regularity tending toward better PSQI) align with the participant’s pattern of protective features. Collectively, the evidence points to sleep that is at least average and likely better than the median of this university sample rather than worse.

PSQI group probability
Considering objective sleep duration and regularity, nocturnal physiological indicators, circadian robustness, and favorable self-report affect and health behaviors, the balance of evidence indicates the participant is likely to have a relatively low (better) PSQI score compared with the study population. Therefore, the participant is assessed as falling in the bottom half of the study distribution with respect to PSQI (i.e., relatively good/average sleep quality).

50766,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The self-report battery indicates a generally low level of mood and anxiety symptoms relative to the study cohort (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24; STAI = 37, Z = -0.43), concurrent with above-average self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.68) and high satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = 0.97). Reported stress is low (Z = -0.71) and happiness is slightly below the cohort mean (Z = -0.53). Academically the participant performs strongly (GPAs range 3.83–4.0). Behavioral leisure patterns show limited sedentary social activity (socializing Z = -2.20) and little solo exercise, but frequent exercise with others and organized sport participation (exercise with others Z = 1.23; sports Z = 0.91). Substance use includes moderate weekly beer consumption (Z = 1.01) and infrequent recreational drug use. Overall, the psychological and lifestyle profile suggests low affective symptom burden and good health perception, with a social pattern characterized by limited casual socializing but structured physical activity.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular profile: Heart-rate-derived circadian features show a robust, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.58, Z = 1.41) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.51, Z = 1.57) are both relatively high, and intradaily variability is relatively low (0.38, Z = -1.16), indicating consistent day-to-day timing and limited fragmentation in activity/physiology. Amplitude of the cosinor fit is elevated (15.81, Z = 1.63) with a mesor of about 78.8 (Z = 0.66) and an acrophase in the late afternoon/early evening (≈5:23 PM). Resting heart rate is typical (58.1 bpm, Z ≈ 0). The hourly deviations from the mesor show a pronounced nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations roughly 1–7 AM, down to ~-23 bpm) and strong daytime elevations (notably ~3–4 PM at +23 bpm), consistent with a well-entrained circadian pattern of lower nocturnal and higher diurnal cardiovascular activation.

Sleep behavior and wearable sleep statistics: Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 7 hours 29 minutes (Z = 0.37), modest night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 100 minutes, Z ≈ -0.03), and infrequent napping (mean naps/day 0.12, Z = 0.61). Sleep start times are relatively late on average (median ≈ 1:27 AM) but show moderate consistency (start time SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z = -0.63). The combination of sufficient median sleep duration and a strong, regular circadian signal (high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, high amplitude) suggests adequate sleep opportunity with consolidated nocturnal physiology despite a late habitual bedtime. Correlations provided in the dataset link greater night-to-night variability and inconsistent sleep timing modestly with worse PSQI (duration SD r ≈ 0.20; start-time SD r ≈ 0.18), but here those variability metrics are near-cohort average to slightly favorable.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): Taken together, subjective and objective indicators point toward relatively good sleep health within this cohort. Objective markers—adequate median duration, low nap frequency, robust circadian regularity, and low physiological fragmentation—tend to associate with better sleep quality. Psychological measures that commonly co-vary with poor sleep (elevated depressive or anxiety symptoms, high stress) are not present at high levels in this participant. The main potential countervailing factor is a late habitual sleep onset (~1:30 AM), which can relate to circadian misalignment or social timing pressures and may contribute to some subjective disturbance in certain contexts; however, the regularity and amplitude of the circadian rhythm suggest the late timing is stable rather than highly irregular. Correlations in the dataset between the participant’s key features and PSQI are generally small in magnitude and do not indicate strong risk for poor global sleep quality.

Overall PSQI group assessment: Balancing the available evidence—adequate median sleep duration, strong circadian regularity, low intradaily variability, modest night-to-night variability, low affective symptom burden, and few naps—supports classification in the lower half of the cohort PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good/average global sleep quality). While the late sleep timing is notable, it appears to be a stable preference rather than a marker of fragmentation or short duration. Therefore the participant is most consistent with the bottom 50% of PSQI scores (better/average sleep quality).

71089,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports mild-to-moderate elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16, Z = 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46), together with relatively low self-esteem (RSES = 27, Z = -1.57) and low satisfaction with physical health (Z = -1.45). These psychological features are the survey-level measures most strongly correlated with poorer PSQI scores in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40; self-esteem r ≈ -0.36), indicating that subjective distress and self-evaluation are potential contributors to worse perceived sleep. Lifestyle indicators show minimal substance or drug use but very low physical activity (exercise reported “not at all” with large negative Z-scores), substantial sedentary/leisure screen time (internet/music use Z > 1.5), and consistent time spent socializing. Taken together, the self-report profile suggests some psychological vulnerability and low engagement in protective health behaviors (notably exercise) that, if experienced subjectively, tend to co-occur with worse sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology: In contrast to the psychological risk indicators, wearable measures show objectively long and regular nocturnal sleep and a well-structured circadian pattern. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 12 minutes (Z = 1.26), with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 63 minutes, Z = -0.85) and a stable sleep onset time (median start ≈ 00:50, start-time SD ≈ 39 minutes, Z = -0.96). Napping is essentially absent. Circadian summary metrics are consistent with a robust, regular rhythm: high interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33), low intradaily variability (0.43, Z = -0.81), and a positive 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.23). Heart-rate-based cosinor features show an elevated mesor (86.9, Z = 1.77) and a moderate amplitude (Z = 0.83), with the acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:34 PM). Nighttime hourly heart-rate deviations show a clear nocturnal decline relative to the mesor (largest negative deviations between ~1:00–7:00 AM), indicating physiological downregulation during typical sleep hours. Resting heart rate is somewhat elevated (71.2 bpm, Z = 1.55), which could reflect higher tonic cardiovascular arousal but does not appear to have disrupted nocturnal heart-rate dipping or circadian regularity.

Integrated interpretation for sleep quality (PSQI-relevant): Objective wearable indicators (long median sleep duration, low variability, consistent sleep timing, strong interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, clear nocturnal heart-rate decline) collectively point to well-timed, regular, and physiologically consolidated sleep—features that are generally associated with lower PSQI scores (better sleep quality). Conversely, survey-reported affective risk factors (elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety, low self-esteem) and low physical activity are associated with higher PSQI in the sample and could increase subjective sleep complaints. The magnitudes of the objective sleep/circadian indicators are relatively large in the sample (Z-scores > 1 for sleep duration and for several circadian metrics), whereas psychological elevations are modest (Z ≈ 0.3–0.5). Because the PSQI primarily captures subjective, multi-domain sleep disturbance but the participant shows strong objective evidence of adequate, regular nocturnal sleep and circadian stability, the balance of evidence favors a relatively good/average PSQI outcome (i.e., likely in the lower half of the study distribution), albeit with the caveat that mild affective symptoms could inflate self-reported problems.

22688,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 27, Z = -1.41), alongside elevated self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.1) and above-average current happiness (Z = 1.64). Perceived health satisfaction is also relatively high (Z = 1.22). Academic performance is strong (GPA ~3.9 across terms). Social and recreational activity is moderate: the participant reports socializing and internet use at modest levels and almost no sedentary hobbies or reading. Alcohol use is present at a light-to-moderate weekly frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), while recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Exercise is primarily social (exercised with others three or more times per week, Z = 1.23) rather than solitary. Taken together, self-report indicates good psychological well‑being and health-related behaviors that would generally be supportive of healthy sleep.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological patterns: Heart-rate cosinor metrics indicate a mesor of 73.9 bpm (Z = -0.01) and an amplitude of 8.75 (Z = -0.66), with acrophase around mid-afternoon (4:14 PM). Resting heart rate is 60.4 bpm (Z = 0.27), which is within a typical range for this sample. The aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show a pronounced nocturnal decline in heart rate (nadir between ~3–6 AM with deviations down to about -18.6 bpm at 5–6 AM) and daytime elevations peaking in the early-to-mid afternoon (positive deviations ~10–11 bpm at 1–3 PM). Non-parametric circadian measures are relatively low: interdaily stability (0.27, Z = -1.15), intradaily variability (0.29, Z = -1.80), and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.11, Z = -1.79). These non-parametric values suggest the participant’s heart-rate rhythm shows less pronounced day-to-day rigid regularity compared with the sample mean but also low within-day fragmentation; physiologically, the participant demonstrates an expected nocturnal dip and a clear daytime rise in cardiovascular activity.

Sleep timing and duration (wearable): Fitbit-derived sleep measures indicate long and consistent sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 2 minutes (Z = 1.05), with a relatively small night-to-night variability (SD = 78 minutes, Z = -0.51). Median sleep start time is approximately 00:33 (12:33 AM), and sleep start time variability is modest (SD = 47 minutes, Z = -0.79). The participant reports essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). The pattern is of sufficient nightly sleep duration, consistent bedtimes, and low propensity for daytime sleep episodes — features typically associated with better subjective sleep quality.

Concordance between self-report, physiology, and sleep quality indicators: Multiple lines of evidence point in the direction of relatively good sleep quality. Objective sleep duration is above the sample mean (Z > 1) and variability is below average, while subjective psychological indicators (low depressive/anxious symptoms, high happiness and health satisfaction) are protective. Physiological sleep signatures (clear nocturnal heart-rate decline and low intradaily variability) are consistent with consolidated nighttime sleep. Correlations provided in the dataset between these metrics and PSQI are generally weak; where present they do not contradict the impression of comparatively favorable sleep (for example, sleep duration has a very small positive correlation with PSQI, but the magnitude is negligible).

Potential considerations and minor risk factors: Alcohol use at roughly 1–2 times per week is modestly above the sample median (Z ≈ 1.0) and, depending on timing, could influence sleep continuity or sleep architecture. The low interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation indicate somewhat weaker day-to-day circadian rigidity, which could reflect variable daily schedules or external demands across the semester; however, this is counterbalanced by consistent sleep start times and low sleep variability, suggesting that any day-to-day differences did not substantially fragment nightly sleep in this participant.

Overall assessment of PSQI placement: The convergent evidence — objectively long and consistent nightly sleep, low sleep variability, minimal napping, normative resting heart rate with a clear nocturnal decline, and favorable psychological self-reports — points toward relatively good or average sleep quality in comparison to the study population. While a few circadian metrics indicate lower interdaily regularity, these are not accompanied by signs of fragmented or insufficient sleep. On balance, the participant is more consistent with the lower half of the PSQI distribution (better sleep quality) rather than the upper half.

38815,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports relatively low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 11, Z = -0.24) and near-ceiling self-esteem (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03). Trait anxiety is modestly elevated relative to the sample (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17), while self-rated happiness (Z = 0.55) and health satisfaction (Z = 1.05) are above average. Stress is close to the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.1). The pattern suggests overall positive self-reported well-being with a small elevation in chronic anxiety proneness; given the moderate correlations of depressive and anxiety measures with PSQI in this cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), these symptom levels point toward only a modest risk for sleep complaints rather than a large effect.

Lifestyle and daytime behaviors: The participant exercises frequently (exercised alone ≥3×/week, Z = 1.07), drinks beer about 1–2 times per week (Z = 1.01), and reports relatively high internet use (3–4 hours/day, Z = 1.52). Recreational drug use is absent. Frequent solo exercise and high health satisfaction are protective for sleep, while elevated evening screen/internet time and weekly alcohol use are potential contributors to sleep disruption. The participant’s social and sedentary hobby engagement is low-to-moderate; these daytime behavioral patterns are consistent with maintaining general fitness but include behaviors (late-night online activity, alcohol) that can increase variability in sleep timing and quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics: Heart-rate–based circadian summary metrics suggest a relatively low average cardiac level (Mesor = 65.9 bpm, Z = -1.10; Resting HR = 47.5 bpm, Z = -1.27), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Amplitude is moderately elevated (Amplitude Z = 0.58) and the acrophase occurs in the late afternoon (≈5:55 PM), indicating a clear daytime/evening separation of higher versus lower physiological activation. Nonparametric circadian regularity is reduced: interdaily stability is below average (Value = 0.31, Z = -0.82) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (Z = -0.53), whereas intradaily variability is only slightly above average (Z = 0.10). Together these findings indicate robust day–night amplitude and low resting rates (protective factors) but relatively inconsistent day-to-day timing of the circadian pattern (a risk factor for worse subjective sleep).

Sleep timing, duration, and variability: Nightly sleep duration is near the sample median (median = 7 h 3 min, Z = -0.16), but night-to-night variability is appreciable (sleep duration SD = 136 minutes, Z = 0.80). Median sleep onset is late (≈00:50) with moderate consistency across nights (sleep start SD ≈ 67 min, Z = -0.35). Napping is infrequent (mean daily naps = 0.12, Z = 0.61). The combination of generally adequate total sleep time with a late habitual bedtime and elevated night-to-night variability is important: variability in duration and irregular timing are both modestly correlated with higher PSQI in this sample (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep timing variability r ≈ 0.18), so these features represent the principal objective sleep-related risks observed.

Integrated interpretation and likely PSQI placement: Multiple objective and subjective signals point to a generally average-to-better-than-average sleep profile. Protective indicators include adequate median sleep duration (~7 hours), high physical fitness (low resting HR, regular exercise), elevated circadian amplitude, and relatively low depressive symptom burden; these features are associated with lower PSQI scores in the cohort. Countervailing signals are late habitual bedtime (~00:50), above-average night-to-night sleep duration variability, reduced interdaily circadian stability, elevated internet use and weekly alcohol, and mildly elevated trait anxiety—each associated in this sample with small increases in PSQI. On balance, the magnitude and direction of the relevant measures (especially adequate median duration, strong fitness markers, and low depressive symptoms) suggest the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality) rather than the upper half.

72885,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"Sleep timing and duration: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a markedly delayed and curtailed sleep pattern. Median nightly sleep duration was 5 hours 59 minutes (Z = -1.5), indicating substantially shorter sleep than the study average. The median sleep start time was extremely late (≈03:44), with moderate night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈81 minutes). Sleep duration variability (SD ≈93 minutes) is moderate. Taken together, these features indicate a pattern of habitual late sleep onset and short total sleep time across the semester, both of which are commonly linked with poorer subjective and objective sleep quality.

Circadian rhythm and physiological profile: Heart-rate–derived circadian measures indicate reduced amplitude of the daily heart rate rhythm (amplitude = 7.68, Z = -1.0) and relatively low interdaily stability (0.25, Z = -1.32), suggesting a blunted and less regular circadian structure across days. The estimated MESOR (mean cardiac level) and resting heart rate are on the lower side of the sample distribution (MESOR ≈68.6 bpm, Z = -0.74; resting HR ≈54.4 bpm, Z = -0.45), which could reflect greater cardiovascular fitness or a generally lower tonic heart rate. The hourly aggregate deviations show an unusually elevated heart rate relative to the mesor at ~1–2 AM (value 6.66, Z = 2.04) and large negative deviations in the early morning (≈5–7 AM, values ~-16 to -17), consistent with a pattern in which physiological arousal is relatively higher during the late-night window surrounding the participant’s primary sleep onset. Low amplitude and reduced interdaily stability together point to a less robust circadian organization, which is typically associated with degraded sleep consolidation and daytime functioning.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context: Self-report measures indicate elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46) and depressive symptom scores near the typical screening cutoff (CES-D = 15, Z = 0.18; classified here as “Not depressed” but close to clinical screening thresholds). Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01). Health satisfaction is below average (Z ≈ -0.53). Substance and recreational drug measures show relatively high Z-scores for recreational drug items (notably large Z values reported), and recreational drug use frequency is listed as ~1–2 times per week; alcohol use is infrequent (1–2 times a month). Physical activity and organized sport engagement are low. Many of these self-report features (higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem and health satisfaction, irregular/exergent substance use) show small-to-moderate correlations with higher PSQI in the provided correlation estimates (STAI ~0.4, CES-D ~0.5, self-esteem ~-0.35, health satisfaction ~-0.21), suggesting these psychological and lifestyle factors are likely contributing to sleep complaints in this participant.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality: The combination of very late habitual sleep timing (~03:44), short nightly sleep duration (~6 hours), reduced circadian amplitude and stability, and elevated anxiety/near-threshold depressive symptoms creates a convergent profile that is typically associated with worse global sleep quality. Although the participant’s resting heart rate is relatively low (which may reflect fitness and is not inherently adverse for sleep), the core behavioral and circadian indicators (late and short sleep, irregularity, blunted amplitude) are robust predictors of higher PSQI scores. Correlational estimates provided in the dataset show moderate positive relationships between mood symptoms and PSQI and smaller but consistent associations between circadian irregularity and PSQI, supporting an interpretation of relatively poor sleep.

Assessment relative to the study distribution: Evidence for relatively good or average sleep (bottom half of PSQI distribution) is limited: a low resting heart rate and only modest night-to-night variability are the main neutral/positive indicators. In contrast, multiple salient indicators point toward poorer sleep (short median sleep duration Z = -1.5, extremely delayed sleep onset, low interdaily stability Z = -1.32, low amplitude Z = -1.0, elevated anxiety/CES-D near cutoff). On balance, the convergence of objective sleep timing/duration deficits, weakened circadian rhythmicity, and affective risk factors supports classification in the group with higher (worse) PSQI scores. Therefore, the participant most likely falls in the top half of the PSQI distribution (poorer sleep quality).

71193,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Summary of psychological and behavioral traits:
The participant reports markedly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 39, Z = 2.67) and high trait anxiety (STAI = 60, Z = 1.85). Self-esteem and momentary happiness are well below the study mean (RSES Z = -1.43; happiness Z = -1.61), and perceived stress is above average (Z ≈ 0.92). Substance use is essentially absent and overall health satisfaction is slightly below average. Daily activities are characterized by relatively low physical activity (exercise infrequent, Zs negative) and higher-than-average engagement with video games and sedentary hobbies (video games Z = 2.47; sedentary hobby Z = 1.41). Taken together, the self-report profile indicates substantial negative affect and psychological distress concurrent with low social/physical engagement.

Objective circadian and physiological patterns from the wearable:
Heart-rate-based circadian metrics indicate a reasonably robust and regular circadian structure. Interdaily stability is high (0.60, Z = 1.57) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is elevated (0.54, Z = 1.82), while intradaily variability is low (0.37, Z = -1.24). Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is moderately above average (amplitude Z = 0.96) with an acrophase around early evening (≈ 5:49 PM). Resting heart rate is within a typical range (59 bpm, Z = 0.10). Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations overnight) and daytime elevations in the mid-afternoon; none of these hourly deviations show large correlations with PSQI in this sample. Overall, the wearable-derived physiological data point to a structured, low-fragmentation circadian pattern and normal cardiovascular baseline.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Objectively measured sleep duration is longer than the cohort average (median = 8 h 2 min, Z = 1.05) and sleep timing is consistently late: median sleep start ~01:47 AM with low night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = -0.93; sleep duration SD Z = -1.04). Mean daily naps are somewhat elevated relative to the cohort (0.19 naps/day, Z = 1.34). The combination of long nightly sleep, low night-to-night variability, and low intradaily heart-rate fragmentation suggests preserved objective sleep quantity and regularity—even though the sleep period is systematically delayed into the early morning hours.

Integration and implication for subjective sleep quality (PSQI):
There is a divergence between objective sleep metrics (good quantity, consistent timing, low fragmentation) and psychological self-report (high depressive symptoms, elevated anxiety, low positive affect). In this dataset depressive and anxiety scores have moderate positive correlations with PSQI (CES-D correlation ≈ 0.49; STAI correlation ≈ 0.40), meaning that high distress commonly co-occurs with worse subjective sleep quality. Although objective circadian regularity and long, stable sleep duration typically predict better PSQI components tied to sleep efficiency and disturbances, the participant’s marked affective symptoms and daytime psychological burden increase the likelihood of elevated subjective sleep complaints (sleep quality, latency, daytime dysfunction). The late habitual sleep onset (near 01:47 AM) and increased napping could further contribute to perceived daytime dysfunction or reduced sleep quality despite adequate duration.

Holistic conclusion regarding PSQI percentile:
Weighing the evidence, the objective data favor relatively good sleep quantity and circadian regularity, which would argue for lower (better) PSQI scores. However, the participant’s pronounced depressive symptom burden and high trait anxiety—both moderately associated with worse PSQI in the study—are likely to drive elevated subjective sleep complaints. On balance, the psychological risk factors that strongly relate to subjective sleep disturbance are sufficiently large to outweigh the protective objective sleep features for predicting perceived sleep quality. Therefore it is more likely that this participant’s overall PSQI score falls in the top half of the study distribution (worse sleep quality).

98760,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Psychological and lifestyle profile: The participant reports low levels of depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66; STAI = 33, Z = -0.82), relatively high self-esteem (RSES Z = 0.82) and above-average momentary happiness (current happiness Z = 1.64). Stress is below the population mean (Z = -0.71). Substance use is essentially absent and the participant reports exercising alone frequently (three times per week or more, Z = 1.07). Together, these self-report indicators characterize a psychological and behavioral profile that, on commonly measured correlates, would be expected to support at least average sleep quality: low affective symptom burden, low substance use, regular exercise, and relatively high well-being.

Circadian and physiological indicators from the wearable support a well-entrained cardiovascular rhythm. Cosinor-derived amplitude is relatively high (amplitude Z = 1.64), and the mesor and resting heart rate are modest-to-low (mesor = 71.7 bpm, Z = -0.30; resting HR = 53.1 bpm, Z = -0.61), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness and clear day–night separation in heart rate. Interdaily stability (0.47, Z = 0.5) is modestly above average, indicating some regularity in daily timing across days; autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.40, Z = 0.64) likewise indicates repeatable daily structure. Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.67, Z = 0.88), which can reflect more frequent transitions between activity and rest within days, but this metric shows little correlation with PSQI in the study (correlation ~ 0.0). Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal decreases (largest negative deviations between ~3–7 AM) and clear evening increases (notably 6–9 PM and peaks around 8–9 PM), consistent with consolidated sleep physiology overnight and relatively active evenings rather than physiological arousal during the habitual sleep window.

Sleep timing and quantity present mixed signals. Median sleep duration from the Fitbit is 6 hours 52 minutes (Z = -0.39), a bit below typical recommended sleep length but not extreme; night-to-night variability in duration is moderate (SD = 102 minutes). Median sleep onset time is late (01:58:45), with a standard deviation of sleep start around 65 minutes. Napping is rare (mean daily naps = 0.12, Z = 0.61). A late habitual sleep onset combined with slightly shortened nightly duration could contribute to some subjective or objective sleep disturbance, but other markers—relatively stable circadian amplitude, substantial nocturnal heart-rate decline, low resting HR, and low affective symptoms—argue against pronounced sleep pathology. Several variables that correlate positively with poorer PSQI in the study (depressive and anxiety symptoms) are low for this participant, suggesting these common drivers of poor subjective sleep are not prominent here.

Synthesis and PSQI group assignment: Balancing the evidence, the participant shows many features associated with average-to-good sleep quality (low affective symptoms, low substance use, regular exercise, clear circadian amplitude, and nocturnal physiological downregulation) while also showing a late sleep schedule and slightly short sleep duration. The late sleep timing is the main behavioral risk for poorer subjective sleep, but the magnitude of other favorable indicators and weak-to-moderate deviations in wearable sleep metrics suggest the participant’s overall PSQI score is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality rather than the worse half). Therefore the participant is classified as below the group median for PSQI (bottom 50).

Self-reported happiness is low (Current = 2.0; Z = -1.61), and self‑esteem is higher than average in this dataset (RSES Z = 0.96), though sample-level correlations point to lower self‑esteem being associated with worse PSQI (r = -0.36). Substance use is minimal and social/leisure engagement is relatively high (notably 1–2 hours of video games; Z = 2.47 and 3–4 hours socializing; Z = 1.74), suggesting an active evening social/entertainment pattern but limited use of alcohol or recreational drugs.

Sleep behavior and wearable sleep statistics: Objective sleep duration is near the cohort median (median sleep 7 h 15 min; Z = 0.09), but night-to-night consistency is poor.

Mean daily naps are non-zero (0.22 naps/day; Z = 1.75), indicating some daytime compensation.

Although average nightly duration is adequate at the aggregate level, the combination of late, inconsistent bedtimes and occasional napping suggests irregular sleep patterns that commonly contribute to subjective sleep complaints.

Circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart-rate based circadian metrics show a strong day–night amplitude (amplitude = 17.15; Z = 2.06) and a clear evening acrophase (7:41 PM), indicating a pronounced peak in physiological arousal in the evening. Aggregate hourly deviations from the mesor reveal marked evening and late-night elevations in heart rate (e.g., 7–8 PM deviation ≈ +31 bpm, Z = 3.42; 12–1 AM ≈ +12 bpm, Z = 2.04) followed by expected nocturnal reductions across the early morning hours. Resting heart rate is relatively low (51.4 bpm; Z = -0.80), which can reflect better cardiovascular fitness and is not strongly associated with PSQI here. Interdaily stability (0.46; Z = 0.42) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (Z = 1.06) indicate some day-to-day regularity in the circadian signal, while intradaily variability is modest (0.57; Z = 0.17). Overall, the wearable physiology shows pronounced evening arousal and a robust amplitude of rhythm but not a strongly fragmented circadian structure; the timing of peak arousal earlier in the night combined with a very late sleep onset suggests a misalignment between physiological arousal timing and reported sleep schedule.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI): Protective indicators include average nightly sleep duration close to the sample median and low substance/drug use, and physiological markers (low resting HR, strong amplitude) that do not on their own indicate poor sleep. However, multiple risk indicators for poorer subjective sleep are present and relatively large in magnitude: clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D), elevated trait anxiety (STAI), very late and inconsistent sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 03:11 AM and high SD), and measurable evening physiological arousal (large evening heart-rate deviations, acrophase ~7:41 PM). Sample-level correlations provided show moderate positive associations between depressive/anxiety symptoms and PSQI and smaller positive associations for sleep variability. Balancing protective and risk features, the consistency and magnitude of affective symptoms together with the late/irregular sleep schedule and its positive correlations with PSQI argue that this participant is more likely to report worse subjective sleep quality than the median participant.

Final classification: top half (worse PSQI).

71985,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Sleep behavior and physiological rhythms: The participant’s wearable-derived sleep and circadian profile indicates a broadly regular, robust day–night pattern. Median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 18 minutes (Z = 0.14), with virtually no recorded naps, and a median sleep-start time of ~00:21. Night-to-night variability is present but modest (sleep duration SD = 108 minutes, Z = 0.17; sleep-start SD = 99 minutes, Z = 0.35). Heart-rate based circadian metrics show high interdaily stability (0.66, Z = 2.07) and elevated 24-hour autocorrelation (0.53, Z = 1.74), indicating consistent timing of physiological rhythms across days. The cosinor amplitude is above average (13.91, Z = 1.01) with a mesor and resting heart rate that are below the population mean (mesor 66.36 bpm, Z = -1.04; resting HR 50 bpm, Z = -0.97), which together imply a pronounced daytime–nighttime separation in cardiovascular activity and relatively low basal cardiac tone. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show substantial negative deviations overnight (approximately -9 to -25 bpm between midnight and 7 AM) and clear positive deviations during daytime and early evening (largest positive deviation ~+19 bpm at 1–2 PM, Z = 1.88; and ~+20 bpm at 7–8 PM, Z = 1.50), consistent with a strong, consolidated nocturnal rest period and daytime activity peaks.

Psychological traits and lifestyle behaviors relevant to sleep: Self-report mood and trait measures are near the study average or only mildly elevated. The CES-D score is 14 (Z = 0.07; classified here as “Not depressed”), and the trait anxiety score is 41 (Z = -0.03), both close to the cohort mean; both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), suggesting these domains can influence subjective sleep but are not extreme for this participant. Self-esteem is somewhat lower than average (RSES = 34, Z = -0.59). Health satisfaction is relatively low (2.67 on a 1–7 scale, Z = -1.2) and BMI is 27.4, indicating overweight status; these factors can associate with sleep complaints but have modest PSQI correlations in the provided data. Behavioral factors that typically benefit sleep are present: the participant reports exercising alone three or more times per week (Z = 1.07) and reports no alcohol or recreational drug use (substance use Z-scores ≤ -0.31). Conversely, recreational screen time is notable (video games 1–2 hours, Z = 2.47; TV/videos 1–2 hours, Z = 1.28), which can signal evening stimulation—however objective wearables still indicate consolidated nocturnal low heart-rate periods and no excess daytime napping.

Integrated interpretation for sleep quality (PSQI inference): Converging objective indicators point toward generally adequate and regular sleep. Median sleep duration is within recommended ranges, nocturnal heart-rate suppression is consistent and large in magnitude, circadian stability and rhythm amplitude are high, resting heart rate is low, and there are no recorded naps—each of these features is typically associated with better objective sleep consolidation and timing. Subjective and psychological risk factors for poor sleep are present but not pronounced: depression and anxiety scores are near the cohort mean, self-esteem and health satisfaction are somewhat lower, and screen-based evening activities are elevated, which could contribute to mild sleep complaints or variability on some nights (reflected in the modest SDs for duration and start time). Correlations provided in the dataset show the strongest single associations with PSQI are depressive symptoms and trait anxiety, but the participant’s values on those measures are not elevated relative to peers. Balancing the evidence, the objective physiological pattern and sleep quantity/timing indicators outweigh the modest psychosocial risk signals.

Conclusion regarding PSQI group: On balance, the participant’s multimodal profile (adequate median sleep duration, strong circadian regularity and amplitude, low resting heart rate, no naps, and only modest psychosocial risk) is more consistent with PSQI scores in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively good or average sleep quality) than with the top half (poorer sleep). Therefore the participant is most likely in the bottom 50% of the study population with respect to PSQI.

43125,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports a high burden of mood and anxiety symptoms: CES-D = 37 (Z = 2.47) and STAI-Trait = 53 (Z = 1.16), indicating substantially elevated depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms relative to the sample. Self-esteem is modestly below the sample average (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73). Health satisfaction and self-reported happiness are below the cohort mean (health satisfaction Z = -0.7; happiness Z = -0.53). Behavioral risk factors are notable: frequent alcohol use (beer three times per week; wine 1–2×/week) and frequent recreational drug use (self-reported 1–2×/week; Z = 5.44) are markedly above the population distribution. The participant reports little to no exercise or sports (Z-scores from -1.09 to -1.93) and spends more time than average in sedentary media activities (TV, video games, internet). Together, these trait and lifestyle indicators describe elevated affective distress and high substance exposure with limited physical activity and elevated sedentary recreation.

Objective sleep timing and duration (wearable-derived):
Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of about 7 hours 28 minutes (Z = 0.35), with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 72 minutes, Z = -0.66) and in sleep start time (median start 02:00 AM; start-time SD = 45 minutes, Z = -0.82). Mean daily naps are infrequent (0.14/day, Z = 0.82 but low absolute value). These metrics indicate that, on objective measures, the participant typically achieves an average-to-slightly-above-average total sleep time and maintains relatively consistent (though late) sleep timing across days.

Cardiovascular circadian profile and nocturnal physiology:
Heart-rate–derived circadian measures show a relatively high amplitude (14.99, Z = 1.36) with a mesor slightly above the cohort mean (78.48 bpm, Z = 0.62) and a resting heart rate that is modestly lower than average (54.8 bpm, Z = -0.4). The heart rate acrophase is in the early evening (≈6:29 PM), and hourly aggregated deviations show elevated cardiovascular activity in late evening hours (e.g., 12–1 AM: +9.9 bpm, Z = 1.67; sustained positive deviations through 11 PM–1 AM) followed by pronounced declines across the overnight period. Nonparametric circadian indices suggest moderate day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.44, Z = 0.25) and relatively low intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.49, Z = -0.39). The pattern of elevated evening heart rate and a delayed acrophase is consistent with a shifted circadian timing and some evening physiological arousal preceding the typical sleep period.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI-relevant):
There is a divergence between objective and subjective risk indicators. Objectively, total sleep time and sleep regularity are within or slightly better than the sample average, and nocturnal HR drops are present, which would not by themselves predict severe sleep duration deficits. However, the participant’s very elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both of which correlate positively with PSQI in this dataset: CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40) and heavy recreational substance use (extremely high relative Z) are robust predictors of worse subjective sleep quality. The delayed sleep timing (median sleep onset ≈ 2:00 AM) and evening cardiovascular activation may also contribute to increased sleep latency, perceived sleep disturbance, or daytime dysfunction despite adequate total sleep time. Low physical activity and elevated sedentary media use are additional lifestyle features that commonly relate to poorer perceived sleep quality. Given the relatively strong links between affective symptom burden and subjective sleep problems in the cohort and the participant’s markedly elevated affective scores and substance exposure, the balance of evidence points toward poorer PSQI-reported sleep quality even though objective duration is adequate.

Conclusion — relative PSQI placement:
While objective Fitbit measures indicate average-to-slightly-above-average sleep duration and stability, the participant’s very high depressive symptom burden and elevated trait anxiety, together with heavy recreational drug use and late sleep timing with evening physiological activation, are likely to increase subjective sleep complaints. Considering the magnitude of these subjective risk factors and their moderate-to-strong correlations with PSQI in this sample, the overall evidence supports classification in the higher (worse) half of the cohort PSQI distribution.

98117,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports notably elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 33; Z = 2.05) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 53; Z = 1.16). Self-esteem is below the study mean (RSES = 32; Z = -0.87), and single-item positive affect/trust measures are low (happiness Z = -1.61; trust Z = -2.07). Substance use is effectively absent and health-satisfaction is modestly below average, but the participant reports very low socializing and no regular exercise. Daily leisure is dominated by high screen time (internet >4 hours, TV/video 2–3 hours) and modest passive hobbies. The combination of high depressive/anxiety scores, low social engagement and exercise, and extended evening screen exposure represents a behavioral profile that tends to co-occur with sleep disturbance and greater subjective sleep complaints (supported by moderate positive correlations of CES-D and STAI with PSQI in the sample).

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular indicators: Heart-rate-based circadian summary measures are mixed. The participant’s MESOR (mean fitted heart rate) and resting heart rate are both above the sample mean (Mesor = 80.99, MESOR Z = 0.96; Resting HR = 66.4 bpm, Z = 0.98), suggesting modestly elevated overall cardiovascular tone. Circadian amplitude is slightly below average (9.49, Z = -0.42), and intradaily variability is low (0.30, Z = -1.73), indicating relatively little fragmentation of heart-rate rhythm within days. Interdaily stability is near average (0.40, Z = -0.08), consistent with some day-to-day regularity in activity patterns. The cosinor acrophase (peak) at ~6:27 PM is an evening peak in heart rate, which together with the elevated mesor and higher early-night deviations (see below) is compatible with higher physiological arousal in late evening/early night hours.

Hourly heart rate deviations and implications for arousal timing: Aggregated hourly deviations from the MESOR show small positive deviations around midnight–1 AM (12–1am = +3.11; 1–2am = +0.58) followed by progressively larger negative deviations later in the night and early morning (largest negative around 6–7am = -16.19). The elevated or non-dipping heart rate in the early night hours (relative to the participant’s mean) together with the elevated resting HR and MESOR is consistent with greater physiological arousal during typical sleep onset times. Several of these early-night deviations correlate positively with PSQI in the sample (e.g., 3–4am correlation ≈ 0.22), linking nocturnal arousal patterns with worse subjective sleep.

Sleep timing, duration, and regularity: Wearable sleep measures indicate a substantially delayed and highly variable sleep schedule. Median sleep start time is 04:03:17 (very late), and variability in sleep start time is extremely large (SD = 280 minutes, Z = 4.33). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is also markedly elevated (sleep duration SD = 234 minutes, Z = 3.02). Median nightly sleep duration is ~6 hours 37 minutes (Z = -0.71), slightly shorter than the sample mean but not severely truncated. Napping is infrequent. Taken together, these data indicate a chronotype or sleep-scheduling pattern characterized by very late sleep onset with large night-to-night inconsistency in timing and duration.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality: Psychological symptoms (high depressive and anxiety scores), behavioral contributors (high evening screen time, low exercise and socialization), physiological signs (elevated MESOR/resting HR and relative early-night arousal), and markedly delayed and inconsistent sleep timing form a coherent profile associated with elevated sleep disturbance. The very late median sleep onset and the extreme variability in sleep timing/duration are particularly salient risk factors for poor subjective sleep quality. Correlational evidence in the sample (CES-D and STAI have moderate positive correlations with PSQI; measures of variability and some nocturnal HR deviations also show positive associations) further supports the interpretation that this participant’s pattern is associated with higher PSQI scores.

PSQI group assignment: Considering the convergence of high depressive and anxiety symptoms, elevated resting cardiovascular tone, very late and highly variable sleep timing, and behavioral risk factors (high evening screen time, lack of exercise, low social engagement), the balance of evidence points toward poorer overall sleep quality relative to the study population. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep quality).

24883,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant presents a generally low mood burden and moderate psychosocial risk factors. Self-report measures show a low depressive symptom score (CES-D = 9, Z = -0.45) and only mildly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 42, Z = 0.07). Self-esteem is relatively high (RSES Z = 1.52) and reported stress is modestly above average (Stress Z = 0.38). Alcohol use is present at a moderate, weekly level (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week, Z ≈ 1), recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent, and the participant reports minimal daytime napping and low levels of social/leisure engagement. Overall, the psychological profile does not indicate prominent depressive symptomatology but does reflect some social isolation, low BMI, and occasional alcohol use that may interact with sleep timing.

Sleep behavior and wearable-derived sleep metrics: Nightly sleep measured by the wearable shows a median sleep duration near 6 hours 53 minutes (Z = -0.38), with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 88 minutes, Z = -0.30) and in sleep start time (SD = 69 minutes, Z = -0.30). However, the median sleep start time is very late (03:00), indicating a consistent delayed sleep schedule. Low nap frequency (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07) and a moderately consolidated pattern of sleep duration suggest the participant attains near-normal total sleep opportunity on many nights, but the timing of sleep is substantially shifted later than typical student schedules. The combination of near-recommended duration yet markedly delayed onset has implications for daytime functioning and alignment with typical social and academic demands.

Circadian rhythm and physiological arousal: Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a blunted and less regular rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.29, Z = -0.99) and amplitude (7.35, Z = -1.11) are both low relative to the study population, and mesor is modestly lower than average (69.03, Z = -0.67), suggesting reduced day-to-day regularity and lower day–night contrast in cardiovascular activity. Aggregated hourly deviations show elevated heart rate relative to the mesor in late-evening and early-night hours (large positive deviations and high Z-scores around 11pm–2am) and pronounced negative deviations in the early morning (5–9am). Importantly, several of the late-night positive deviations (e.g., 1–3am and 3–4am) show small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI, indicating that higher nocturnal physiological arousal aligns with worse self-reported sleep quality in this sample. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.2 bpm, Z = -0.71), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness, but the pattern of late-night elevation suggests circadian misalignment or late-night activity/arousal despite an otherwise low resting baseline.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality: The participant exhibits a mixed profile. Objective indicators of sleep quantity and consolidation (near-7-hour median sleep, low intradaily variability, low nap frequency) argue for at least adequate sleep duration and modest fragmentation, which would tend to predict average-to-better PSQI scores. Counterbalancing that are prominent circadian irregularities and delayed timing (median sleep onset 03:00), reduced interdaily stability and amplitude, and elevated heart rate during late-night hours—features that are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and greater daytime impairment. Given the marked delay in sleep timing combined with physiological night-time arousal that correlates with PSQI, the balance of evidence points toward relatively poorer subjective sleep quality compared with the study population rather than clearly good or average sleep.

Conclusion (PSQI group): Considering the late and irregular timing of sleep, blunted circadian amplitude, and elevated nocturnal physiological arousal that align with higher PSQI in this dataset, the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of the study distribution for PSQI.

The participant’s self-report profile is characterized by generally favorable psychological and lifestyle indicators. Depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 11) is below the sample mean (Z = -0.24) and classified as “not depressed”; trait anxiety (STAI = 41) is close to the cohort mean (Z ≈ -0.03). Self-reported happiness and interpersonal trust are above average (Happy Z = 1.64; Trust Z = 1.47), and perceived health satisfaction is near the mean. Substance use is minimal across beverage and drug categories, and the participant reports no regular sedentary hobby use (many daily recreation items coded as “do not do”). Physical activity is present in a socially-engaged form (exercising with others three times a week or more; Z = 1.23), with low frequency of solitary exercise. These trait and behavioral features (low substance exposure, social exercise, modest stress) are generally associated with better sleep outcomes in this population.

Objective sleep and circadian metrics:
Wearable-derived sleep and circadian measures indicate a predominantly regular, sufficient sleep pattern. Median nightly sleep duration is approximately 7 hours 6 minutes (Z = -0.11), close to the sample central tendency, while night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD = 40 minutes; Z = -1.38), which favors stable sleep quality. Mean daily naps are essentially absent (0.0; Z = -0.86). The median sleep start time, however, is relatively late (01:49), with moderate variability in start time (SD 56 minutes; Z = -0.6), suggesting a delayed sleep schedule despite consistent duration across nights. Circadian analysis from heart rate shows a comparatively high amplitude (Z = 1.64) and moderate interdaily stability (0.51; Z = 0.83), paired with low mesor (Z = -1.32) and a low resting heart rate (45.8 bpm; Z = -1.47). The hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations reveal strong daytime/evening rises (notably a very large positive deviation around 5–6pm and elevated values into the evening) and pronounced nocturnal declines by the early morning hours. Collectively, these features indicate a well-structured and relatively robust circadian organization with pronounced day–night differentiation, albeit with the participant’s preferred sleep timing shifted later.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI):
When integrating subjective and objective data, evidence largely favors relatively good or average overall sleep quality. Strengths that predict lower PSQI scores include adequate total sleep time near cohort norms, low variability in nightly duration, minimal napping, low substance use, social exercise habits, and a pronounced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability—features linked to better sleep consolidation. Psychological risk factors for poor sleep (notably elevated depressive or anxiety symptoms) are not prominent here: CES-D and STAI scores are near or below average, and self-rated happiness is relatively high. Potential countervailing observations are the late median sleep start time (around 01:49), and notable evening physiological activation (large evening heart-rate deviations), which could contribute to difficulties with sleep onset or perceived sleep quality for some individuals. However, the low variability in sleep timing and duration, and objective indicators of strong circadian amplitude and low resting heart rate, argue that late timing does not appear to be producing highly irregular or fragmented sleep in this participant.

Overall PSQI-group classification:
Taken together, the weight of multimodal evidence (adequate and consistent objective sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, minimal napping, healthy lifestyle behaviors, low depressive symptom burden, and robust circadian amplitude and stability) supports the interpretation that this participant’s global PSQI score is more likely to fall in the lower (better) half of the study distribution rather than the upper (worse) half. The late sleep timing is a notable caveat but does not, in this record, outweigh the converging indicators of relatively good sleep quality.

89161,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and lifestyle profile
The self-report data indicate a broadly positive psychological profile: low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4, Z ≈ -0.97) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z ≈ -1.02), alongside elevated self-reported happiness and self-esteem (happy Z ≈ +1.64; self-esteem Z ≈ +1.52). Perceived health satisfaction is also above average (Z ≈ +1.38). Stress ratings are below the study mean (Z ≈ -0.71). Daily leisure patterns show relatively high time spent on socializing and listening to music (both Z > +2.0) and greater internet use (3–4 hours; Z ≈ +1.52). Alcohol use is reported at 1–2 times per week; a single item for “recreational drugs” is extremely elevated relative to the sample (Z ≈ +5.44), which is an outlying behavioral feature that could have sleep-related implications even though its direct correlation with PSQI in this dataset is small.

Wearable-derived sleep quantity and regularity
Objective sleep duration is within a healthy range: median nightly sleep is approximately 7 hours 26 minutes (Z ≈ +0.32), and the participant takes essentially no daily naps (mean naps = 0, Z ≈ -0.86). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is lower than average (SD ≈ 60 minutes, Z ≈ -0.94), and sleep start time is relatively consistent (SD ≈ 47 minutes, Z ≈ -0.79), indicating that total sleep time and its day-to-day variability are both generally favorable. Together these metrics support adequate opportunity for sleep and modest intra-individual stability of core sleep behaviors.

Timing, evening arousal, and circadian structure
Despite adequate total sleep, sleep timing is late: median sleep onset is about 01:56 AM. Hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced reductions across the typical sleeping hours (large negative deviations from MESOR between ~2:00–7:00 AM), consistent with consolidated nocturnal rest. However, there are notable elevations in heart rate during late evening hours (large positive deviations at 10–11 PM and 11–12 AM, with Z-scores for those hours among the highest in the sample), suggesting increased physiological arousal or activity late in the evening. Circadian summary metrics present a mixed picture: interdaily stability (Z ≈ -0.16) and autocorrelation at 24 hours are slightly below average, while intradaily variability is relatively high (Z ≈ +1.30), indicating more fragmentation of activity within days even though average timing of peak activity (acrophase ~5:38 PM) and amplitude are not extreme. Resting heart rate is relatively low (≈54 bpm, Z ≈ -0.51), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low baseline arousal.

Integrative interpretation regarding sleep quality
Taken together, the strongest indicators are (1) objectively adequate and reasonably stable total sleep time, (2) consistent sleep timing variability (low SD), and (3) no habitual daytime napping — all features that typically correspond to better PSQI domain scores for duration and regularity. Counterbalancing these strengths is a consistent late bedtime (~2:00 AM) and evidence of elevated physiological arousal in the late evening hours (10 PM–12 AM), coupled with higher intradaily variability of activity. The participant’s high evening social and internet engagement offers a plausible behavioral source for the late-night arousal. Psychological self-reports (low depression/anxiety, high happiness and self-esteem, low stress) further argue against substantial subjective sleep disturbance. The isolated, very high self-reported recreational drug use is a potential risk factor for sleep disruption but its association with PSQI in this dataset is small.

PSQI group assignment
Integrating objective sleep quantity and stability, subjective well-being, and the pattern of late-evening arousal, the preponderance of evidence favors relatively good to average overall sleep quality compared with the study sample. While late sleep timing and elevated late-evening arousal are potential contributors to some specific PSQI components (e.g., sleep latency or disturbances), the adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, and favorable psychological profile make it more likely that this participant’s global PSQI score falls in the lower half of the cohort distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality).

The participant reports elevated affective symptoms during the survey period: a CES-D score of 24 (Z = 1.11) and an STAI–Trait score of 50 (Z = 0.86), indicating above-average depressive and trait-anxiety symptom burden relative to the study sample. Self-esteem is slightly below sample average (RSES = 35, Z = -0.45). Perceived stress is elevated (Score = 24, Z = 0.65) while self-rated health satisfaction is above average (5.56 on a 1–7 scale, Z = 0.97). Substance use is generally low (infrequent alcohol and no non-prescribed drug use), and the participant exercises frequently alone (three times per week or more, Z = 1.07) but does not participate in organized sports or group exercise. Social time and leisure (listening to music, watching video) are moderately above average. A notably low interpersonal trust score (Z = -3.03) indicates atypically low reported trust in others. Taken together, the profile is characterized by higher internalizing symptoms and stress despite relatively healthy behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use) and moderate life satisfaction.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological summary:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a mixed pattern of preserved nocturnal lowering of heart rate but reduced day-to-day regularity and elevated within-day fragmentation. The mesor (74.7 bpm) and resting heart rate (58.4 bpm) are close to the sample mean (mesor Z = 0.10; resting HR Z = 0.03), and hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced negative deviations overnight (e.g., −22.5 bpm at 5–6 AM) consistent with typical nocturnal cardiac down-regulation. However, non-parametric circadian features indicate reduced interdaily stability (0.35, Z = -0.49), low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.23, Z = -0.78), and markedly elevated intradaily variability (0.83, Z = 2.01). These latter values suggest an irregular, fragmented pattern of activity and physiological arousal across days despite relatively normal mean cardiac levels. The cosinor amplitude is somewhat lower than average (9.52, Z = -0.41) with an acrophase in the early evening (≈5:43 PM), indicating blunted daily amplitude and an evening timing of peak cardiac activity.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Sleep behavior from the wearable shows late and variable sleep timing with modestly short median duration. Median nightly sleep was 6 h 38 min (Z = -0.69), with a late median sleep start time of ~02:24 AM and substantial night-to-night variability in both start time (SD = 104 minutes, Z = 0.46) and duration (SD = 134 minutes, Z = 0.75). The participant also napped more often than typical (mean daily naps = 0.24, Z = 1.90). This pattern—late sleep onset, below-average total sleep time, high night-to-night variability, and elevated nap frequency—is consistent with irregular sleep scheduling and compensatory daytime sleep, which commonly co-occur with greater sleep fragmentation and subjective sleep complaints.

Synthesis regarding sleep quality (PSQI-relevant interpretation):
Multiple convergent signals point toward relatively poorer sleep quality in this participant. The objective wearable indicators relevant to PSQI domains—shorter median sleep duration, late and inconsistent bedtimes, elevated sleep variability, and frequent naps—align with behaviors that increase the likelihood of higher PSQI scores. Elevated intradaily variability and reduced interdaily stability reflect fragmented and irregular rest–activity rhythms, which are associated in the sample with poorer PSQI (correlations in the dataset show small-to-moderate positive associations of variability and mood symptoms with PSQI). Subjective indicators (elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, higher perceived stress) also correlate moderately with worse PSQI in the sample (e.g., CES-D correlation ≈ 0.49). Offsetting factors that could mitigate poor sleep—regular exercise, low substance use, normative resting HR, and relatively high health satisfaction—are present but do not outweigh the combined impact of late timing, short/variable sleep, frequent napping, and elevated mood symptoms. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports classification in the worse-sleep half of the study distribution.

These self-report markers are generally on the favorable side of the study distribution and, given the moderate to strong positive correlations of depressive and anxiety symptoms with PSQI score in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), they support an expectation of comparatively better subjective sleep quality than peers. Lifestyle responses indicate frequent exercise (exercising alone ≥ three times/week, Z = 1.07) and active social time (socializing 2–3 hours, Z = 0.95); both behaviors tend to be associated with better sleep and lower PSQI in population-level analyses (exercise correlations with PSQI are slightly negative in this dataset).

Behavioral habits relevant to sleep timing and exposures: The participant reports modest alcohol use (wine or liquor 1–2 times/week, Z = 0.94) and essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Recreational drug use is reported as rare but not absent (less than 1–2 times/month, Z = 1.61). Daily recreational media and sedentary hobbies are low relative to peers (e.g., little TV/video use Z = -1.25). These behaviors are mixed in terms of sleep risk: low napping and regular exercise are protective for sleep consolidation, while weekly alcohol intake and late-night socializing can contribute to sleep timing disruption depending on timing and dose.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological summary: Heart-rate-based circadian metrics show a modestly lower mesor (69.5 bpm, Z = -0.61) and a typical amplitude (10.5 bpm, Z = -0.08). Resting heart rate is relatively low (53 bpm, Z = -0.61), consistent with fitness and regular exercise. Non-parametric circadian regularity is somewhat reduced: interdaily stability = 0.33 (Z = -0.66), indicating weaker day-to-day consistency of the heart rate rhythm; intradaily variability is low (0.39, Z = -1.09), which suggests fewer rapid transitions in activity within days relative to the sample. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show a pronounced nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–6:00 AM, e.g., -20.9 bpm at 3–4 AM) and strong daytime elevations clustered around midday to mid-afternoon (largest positive deviations 12–3 PM, Zs > 1.2). Together, these patterns indicate preserved nocturnal cardiovascular down-regulation and clear daytime activation, but with reduced regularity across days.

Objective sleep behavior from wearables: The participant’s median nightly sleep duration is short relative to peers at 6 hours 2 minutes (Z = -1.43), with night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 94 minutes) that is slightly below the sample mean (Z = -0.15). The median sleep start time is late at about 01:43 AM, with moderate variability in sleep onset timing (SD ≈ 66 minutes, Z = -0.38). Mean daily napping is negligible. The combination of habitual short sleep duration and a late sleep timing is a salient objective finding: both factors are clinically and epidemiologically linked to worse sleep quality and daytime dysfunction and are commonly reflected in higher PSQI component scores for duration, latency/timing, and daytime dysfunction.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): The data present a mixed but coherent profile. Protective features include low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem, frequent exercise, preserved nocturnal heart-rate dipping, and minimal daytime napping — all factors that tend to be associated with better subjective sleep. Countervailing risk features that are directly relevant to PSQI scoring are objectively short habitual sleep (≈6 h, Z = -1.43) and consistently late sleep timing (median start ≈ 01:43 AM). Wearable circadian regularity (interdaily stability Z = -0.66) is below the sample average, suggesting less consistent timing across days, which would also tend to increase PSQI scores. Correlations in the dataset show that psychological distress variables are important contributors to PSQI, but the participant’s low distress scores do not fully offset the likely negative impact of short sleep duration and late timing on overall PSQI. Considering the relative magnitudes, the most salient drivers of PSQI here are the objectively short sleep duration and late bedtimes, with moderate support from reduced day-to-day circadian stability.

Overall PSQI group classification: weighing the objective sleep markers (short duration, late timing, reduced interdaily stability) that directly map onto multiple PSQI domains against the protective psychological profile (low depression/anxiety, regular exercise, low naps), the balance of evidence suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the higher PSQI range (poorer sleep quality) relative to the study population. Therefore the participant is classified in the top half of the sample distribution for PSQI (top_50).

99733,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"The participant’s self-report profile indicates generally low psychological distress and healthy lifestyle choices that are typically associated with better subjective sleep. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02) are well below the study mean, and self-esteem is relatively high (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73). Reported stress is below average (Z = -0.98) and health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.55). Substance use is essentially absent and recreational/screen activities are low, all of which reduce common behavioral risk factors for poor sleep. The correlations in the dataset indicate that lower depression and anxiety scores are meaningfully related to lower (better) PSQI scores in this sample, so these trait measures favor a lower PSQI for this participant.

Objective wearable sleep statistics show modest shortness of sleep but relatively consistent sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 43 minutes (Z = -0.58), slightly below the population central tendency, with a sleep-duration SD of 86 minutes (Z = -0.33), indicating moderate night-to-night variability. Median sleep start time is about 00:38 with a start-time SD of ~65 minutes (Z = -0.39). Napping is rare (mean daily naps 0.09). These wearable-derived sleep features suggest the participant typically obtains slightly less sleep than the study average but does not show extreme irregularity in bedtime or frequent napping.

Cardiovascular circadian metrics indicate a mixture of preserved day–night structure and features consistent with a blunted or fragmented rhythm. The cosinor MESOR (74.9) is near the sample mean (Z = 0.13) while amplitude is reduced (9.44, Z = -0.43), suggesting a smaller day–night heart-rate difference than many peers. Intradaily variability is relatively elevated (0.70, Z = 1.09), implying more within-day fragmentation of the heart rate rhythm; interdaily stability is slightly below average (0.39, Z = -0.16). Resting heart rate is modestly higher than average (62.6 bpm, Z = 0.53). Hourly aggregated deviations show a clear nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations around 2–6 AM) and midday peaks (largest positive deviations near noon–1 PM), consistent with typical sleeping at night and daytime activity, but the elevated intradaily variability and reduced amplitude point to some circadian blunting that can relate to poorer subjective sleep quality.

Integrating multimodal signals, the balance of evidence favors relatively good-to-average sleep quality rather than the more impaired range. Strong indicators for better PSQI are the markedly low depressive and anxiety scores, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and overall health satisfaction—all of which correlate with lower (better) PSQI in the sample. Countervailing signals are a slightly short median sleep duration and wearable circadian features (higher intradaily variability and lower amplitude) that suggest some physiological fragmentation or blunting of rhythms; these could modestly elevate subjective sleep complaints. On balance, the preponderance of psychological and behavioral evidence and only modest objective circadian concerns make it more likely that this participant’s overall PSQI score falls in the lower or middle portion of the study distribution rather than the top (worse) half.

27407,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological and trait profile
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z = 0.86) with a moderate positive correlation of that score with PSQI in the sample (r ≈ 0.4). Depressive symptoms are below clinical threshold but not absent (CES-D = 13; Z ≈ -0.03) and the CES-D shows the strongest sample correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.5). Perceived stress is modestly above average (Stress Z = 0.38) while self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES Z = -0.31). Together, these self-report indicators point to a psychological profile in which chronic anxiety and some affective symptoms are the clearest risk factors for worse subjective sleep in this individual; stress and self-esteem provide secondary contributions consistent with greater vulnerability to sleep disruption.

Sleep timing and duration (wearable + self-report)
Wearable-derived sleep metrics indicate relatively short habitual sleep: median nightly sleep 6 hours 14 minutes (Z = -1.17), with moderately high night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 120 min; Z = 0.43). The typical sleep start time is very late (median start ≈ 02:02 AM) with a moderate consistency across nights (start-time SD ≈ 51 minutes; Z = -0.71). Napping is negligible (mean daily naps 0.07; Z ≈ -0.08). These features—late sleep onset combined with below-average total sleep and appreciable variability—are commonly associated with elevated PSQI scores in student samples and with the participant’s elevated anxiety and stress levels.

Circadian and cardiovascular signatures
Circadian summary metrics show a relatively low MESOR (mean heart rate level = 65.18 bpm; Z = -1.20) and a modestly above-average amplitude (Amplitude Z = 0.47), with acrophase in the early evening (~5:46 PM). Nonparametric rhythm measures are close to sample mean (interdaily stability 0.40, Z ≈ -0.08; intradaily variability 0.51, Z ≈ -0.25), suggesting the participant has a broadly regular daily structure despite late timing. Resting heart rate is low (46.3 bpm; Z = -1.41), consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregated heart-rate deviations show pronounced evening/late-evening elevation (large positive deviations and high Zs at 7–9 PM and around midnight) and strong nocturnal reductions (large negative deviations from ~2–7 AM, several with Z < -1). This pattern indicates elevated physiological arousal in the late evening and a relatively deep nocturnal cardiac trough once sleep is established—compatible with late sleep onset and subsequent consolidated low cardiac activity during sleep.

Lifestyle behaviors and contextual factors
Behavioral and lifestyle indicators do not show major contributors that would explain poor sleep beyond timing and psychological factors: low alcohol and drug use, regular (but modest) exercise (typically 1–2 times/week), minimal daytime napping, and limited late-night passive screen time reported. Academic performance is high (GPAs ~3.7–3.9), and reported happiness is above average (Z = 0.55), which may buffer some sleep-related impairment. Nonetheless, the combination of late timing, short duration, and elevated anxiety/stress appear to be the dominant influences on sleep quality in this participant.

Integrated assessment with respect to PSQI distribution
Factors supporting relatively good/average PSQI (lower PSQI, bottom 50%): regularity metrics are near-sample mean (interdaily stability and intradaily variability not severely disrupted), low napping, low substance use, good cardiovascular fitness, and some positive well-being indicators (happiness, strong academic performance). Factors supporting higher PSQI (worse sleep, top 50%): late habitual sleep onset (~2:00 AM), short median sleep duration (~6h14m; Z = -1.17), elevated trait anxiety (STAI Z = 0.86) and modest depressive symptoms (CES-D), each of which have positive sample correlations with PSQI (STAI r ≈ 0.4; CES-D r ≈ 0.5). Nighttime heart-rate elevations around midnight/late evening further suggest late-night arousal consistent with delayed sleep timing. Taking the relative strengths of these signals together, psychological risk factors (anxiety/depressive symptoms) and objective behavioral sleep indicators (late onset, short sleep, variability) are stronger and more directly linked to higher PSQI than the buffering lifestyle features are to lower PSQI.

Conclusion
On balance, the preponderance of evidence—especially persistent late sleep timing, short habitual sleep duration, and elevated trait anxiety with some depressive symptomatology—indicates this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of PSQI scores (i.e., relatively poorer sleep) within the study population.

43794,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 55, Z = +1.35), a feature that correlates moderately with worse PSQI scores in this sample (r ≈ 0.40). Perceived stress is also above average (Stress = 26, Z = +1.19; r ≈ 0.20), whereas depressive symptoms are low–to–moderate (CES-D = 10, Z = −0.34) and do not indicate substantial current depressive burden despite a moderate positive correlation of CES-D with PSQI in the cohort (r ≈ 0.49). Self-esteem (RSES = 32, Z ≈ −0.87) and general happiness (Z ≈ −0.53) are below the sample mean, and health satisfaction is notably low (Z = −1.45). Overall, trait anxiety and elevated stress are the psychological features most likely to contribute to poorer sleep quality for this participant.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors:
Substance use is limited (no recreational or non-prescribed drug use; beer less than monthly; wine/liquor ~1–2 times/week, Z ≈ +0.94), and the participant reports essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = −0.86). Physical activity is relatively low and inconsistent (exercising alone 1–2×/month, Z ≈ −0.43; some group exercise 1–2×/week, Z ≈ +0.53). Leisure patterns include unusually high time listening to music (>4 hours, Z ≈ +2.06), while other sedentary recreational activities are minimal. These behaviors suggest limited use of substances or naps that might fragment sleep, but also limited regular exercise and high evening/overall stimulation from prolonged media use, which can be associated with poorer subjective sleep in some individuals.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological signatures:
Heart-rate–based circadian measures show a reduced circadian amplitude (Amplitude = 5.34, Z ≈ −1.76) and low interdaily stability (Value = 0.20, Z ≈ −1.73), indicating a relatively weak and less-consistent 24-hour structure in cardiovascular rhythms across days. Mean resting heart rate is elevated for the cohort (RHR = 70.8 bpm, Z ≈ +1.50), a physiological marker that in this sample is modestly associated with worse PSQI (r ≈ 0.12). Intradaily variability is near the population mean (0.55, Z ≈ +0.03). Aggregate hourly deviations from the mesor show an expected nocturnal decline in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~3–7 AM, e.g., −11.85 at 6–7 AM), demonstrating preserved nocturnal shedding of cardiovascular activity, but the combination of low amplitude and low interdaily stability suggests the timing and strength of this rhythm are dampened and irregular from day to day.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Objective sleep duration is near seven hours (median = 6 h 59 m, Z ≈ −0.24), which is close to the cohort mean and is only weakly correlated with PSQI here (r ≈ 0.05). However, sleep timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:03 AM) and variable (sleep start SD ≈ 122 minutes, Z ≈ +0.86), and duration across nights is markedly inconsistent (duration SD ≈ 156 minutes, Z ≈ +1.25). Both sleep timing irregularity and high night-to-night variability have positive correlations with worse PSQI in this dataset (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18; duration SD r ≈ 0.20). The participant also reports essentially no naps. In sum, average nightly total sleep time is in an acceptable range, but pronounced irregularity in sleep timing and duration—together with late bedtimes—is likely to impair subjective sleep continuity and quality.

Integrated interpretation focused on PSQI:
Multiple converging indicators point toward relatively poorer sleep quality for this participant when compared to the study population. The strongest contributors are elevated trait anxiety and perceived stress (both correlated with worse PSQI), physiological signs of elevated arousal (higher resting heart rate, Z ≈ +1.5), and weakened/irregular circadian organization (low amplitude and low interdaily stability, both Z ≲ −1.7). Although median sleep duration is near the sample mean (~7 hours) and daytime napping is absent, the substantial night-to-night variability in sleep duration and late, inconsistent sleep onset times are associated in this cohort with higher PSQI scores. Taken together, the balance of psychological, behavioral, and wearable signals is more consistent with higher (worse) PSQI than with low/average PSQI.

Final classification:
Because the preponderance of evidence (elevated trait anxiety and stress, irregular and late sleep timing, high sleep variability, elevated resting heart rate, and blunted/intermittent circadian amplitude) is associated with worse subjective sleep in this cohort, the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the study population PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively poorer sleep).

51437,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Survey data indicate a generally healthy psychological profile over the measurement period. The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 4; Z = -0.97) and modest trait anxiety (STAI = 35; Z = -0.62). Self-esteem is elevated relative to the cohort (RSES Z = 0.96). Stress and happiness scores sit slightly below cohort means (stress Z = -0.44; happiness Z = -0.53) and overall health satisfaction is modestly above average (Z = 0.30). Lifestyle behaviors that typically protect sleep are present: regular moderate-to-vigorous activity is high (exercise and sports frequency Z = 1.07 and 1.58) and substance use is low (alcohol 1–2x/month, recreational drugs not used). These psychological and behavioral characteristics argue against major subjective affective drivers of poor sleep (depression/anxiety) and provide behavioral supports for sleep health (frequent exercise, low substance use).

Sleep timing and duration: Wearable-derived sleep statistics show a very late habitual sleep onset (median start time ~02:14 AM) with relatively low night-to-night variability in start time (SD 32 min; Z = -1.12), indicating a consistent but late sleep schedule. Median nightly sleep duration is roughly 6 hours 15 minutes (Z = -1.16), shorter than the study average. Napping is essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). Together these metrics describe a stable delayed sleep timing with limited total sleep opportunity: consistent timing reduces variability (a potentially protective feature), but the late start combined with <6.5 hours median sleep suggests chronic shortened sleep opportunity, which commonly degrades objective and subjective sleep quality.

Circadian structure and nocturnal physiology: Heart-rate-based circadian metrics point to diminished rhythmic amplitude and reduced rhythm stability. Amplitude is low (5.87; Z = -1.59) and interdaily stability is below average (0.31; Z = -0.82), while intradaily variability (0.76; Z = 1.51) is relatively high—this pattern indicates a blunted and somewhat fragmented circadian profile in cardiovascular activity. The participant’s resting heart rate is elevated compared with peers (73 bpm; Z = 1.77) and the mesor is also above average (83.43; Z = 1.29). Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced elevations around midnight–1 AM (12–1 AM deviation Z = 3.91; 11–12 AM Z = 1.52) and then clear decreases across the early morning hours (2–7 AM deviations negative), consistent with a late-night period of elevated arousal followed by physiological downregulation during sleep. Elevated nightly heart-rate peaks at and shortly after midnight combined with low amplitude and higher intradaily variability suggest physiological activation in the late evening and a relatively blunted daily heart-rate rhythm—features often associated with poorer sleep consolidation and worse sleep-related outcomes.

Integration with PSQI-relevant patterns: Several objective features that commonly relate to worse PSQI scores are present: shorter median sleep duration (~6h15), late habitual sleep timing (~2:14 AM), elevated resting heart rate, reduced circadian amplitude, and increased intradaily variability. Correlations between individual circadian/physiological metrics and PSQI in this sample are modest in magnitude, and the participant’s low depression/anxiety and high exercise frequency are protective factors that could mitigate subjective sleep complaints. However, the combination of chronically late sleep timing and objectively blunted and fragmented circadian physiology increases the likelihood of sleep disturbance domains captured by the PSQI (sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and daytime dysfunction). The participant’s consistent late schedule (low start-time variability) may reduce some night-to-night variability in subjective sleep, but it does not offset the objectively reduced sleep duration and signs of circadian disruption.

Overall PSQI group assignment: Balancing protective psychosocial factors (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high exercise, low substance use) against objective indicators of shortened sleep opportunity, late timing, elevated resting heart rate, and weakened circadian rhythmicity, the preponderance of evidence indicates a greater likelihood of relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the cohort median. Therefore it is more likely that this participant’s PSQI score would place them in the top half of the study distribution (worse sleep quality).

21932,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The self-report data indicate a low affective symptom burden and generally adaptive psychological functioning. Depressive symptom scores (CES-D = 4; Z = -0.97) and trait anxiety (STAI = 28; Z = -1.31) are both well below the cohort mean, and perceived stress is markedly low (stress Z = -2.34). Self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg z = +1.66) and health satisfaction sits modestly above average (Z = +0.55). Academic performance is strong (GPAs near or at 4.0). Substance use and recreational drug exposure are minimal and exercise behavior is present though modest (exercise ~1–2×/week). Collectively these indicators point toward psychological and lifestyle factors that are more likely to support good sleep quality rather than contribute to it.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics: Objective sleep duration and regularity appear favorable. Median nightly sleep is long relative to the sample (8 h 14 min; Z = +1.31) with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD 50 min; Z = -1.15) and moderately consistent sleep onset timing (median start ~00:37; start-time SD 55 min; Z = -0.61). Napping is rare (mean daily naps ~0.08). Circadian summary measures show a modestly stable daily rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.49; Z = +0.67) and a mesor and resting heart rate below cohort mean (Mesor 69.7 bpm Z = -0.58; resting HR 54.1 bpm Z = -0.48), consistent with relatively low baseline physiological arousal. Amplitude is slightly above average (12.1; Z = +0.44) and acrophase in the late afternoon (≈5:20 PM), a typical timing for peak daytime cardiovascular activation.

Signals of physiological fragmentation and evening arousal: Intradaily variability is elevated (0.68; Z = +0.95), indicating a degree of within-day fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm relative to peers. Hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced daytime and late-evening excursions: strong positive deviations around midday and early afternoon (12–2 PM; Zs ≈ +2.1 to +2.6) reflecting high daytime activation, and an especially large positive deviation at 10–11 PM (value ≈ +26 bpm; Z = +3.14). There is also a positive deviation at 12–1 AM (Z ≈ +1.47) though overnight hours between roughly 1–8 AM show expected negative deviations (substantial reductions in heart rate relative to mesor). Taken together, these patterns suggest generally low resting physiology and robust daytime peaks but with some elevated late-evening cardiovascular activation and elevated intraday variability that could reflect evening arousal or irregular activity episodes prior to sleep.

Behavioral context and likely impact on sleep quality: Low self-reported stress, minimal substance use, infrequent napping, and long, regular nightly sleep all point toward overall favorable sleep quality. Elevated intradaily variability and the late-evening heart-rate spike (10–11 PM) are the main signals that could counterbalance that picture; they suggest occasional evening physiological arousal or activity that could make sleep initiation or perceived sleep quality more variable on some nights. However, objective sleep duration is long and relatively consistent, and subjective measures of mood and stress are strongly protective. Correlational estimates provided in the dataset show only small-to-moderate associations between these individual measures and PSQI in the cohort, and the participant’s profile is high on the protective factors (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, low stress).

Overall PSQI group assessment: Evidence supporting relatively good/average sleep quality (lower PSQI) includes long median sleep (8 h 14 min; Z = +1.31), low variability in duration (Z = -1.15), rare napping, low psychological distress (CES-D and STAI well below mean), and generally regular circadian timing (interdaily stability Z = +0.67). Counter-evidence for poor sleep (higher PSQI) is limited to elevated intradaily variability (Z ≈ +0.95) and pronounced late-evening heart-rate elevation (10–11 PM Z ≈ +3.14) suggesting some evening arousal. Balancing these factors, the preponderance of indicators (objective sleep quantity/regularity and favorable psychological profile) point toward the participant being in the lower half of the cohort distribution for PSQI (i.e., better sleep quality / bottom 50%).

36385,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report data indicate elevated affective symptoms that are commonly associated with poorer sleep. The CES-D score of 29 (Z = 1.63) reflects a high level of depressive symptoms for the sample; the CES-D—PSQI correlation in this study is relatively strong (r ≈ 0.5), suggesting depressive symptom burden is meaningfully associated with worse sleep quality in this population. Trait anxiety is also elevated (STAI = 49, Z = 0.76) and has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.4), implying chronic anxiety proneness may contribute to sleep complaints. Self-esteem is lower than the sample mean (RSES Z ≈ -1.0), a pattern that in these data associates negatively with sleep quality (r ≈ -0.36 for RSES), consistent with worse subjective sleep among those reporting lower self-worth. Stress level is near the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.1) and self-reported current happiness is slightly above average (Z ≈ 0.55), indicating mixed affective signals beyond the clear elevations in depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. Alcohol use (wine 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 0.94) is higher than average for the sample and may contribute to sleep fragmentation or perceived poor sleep despite not being excessive in frequency by self-report.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian profile: Objective sleep metrics from the Fitbit show a long median nightly sleep duration (median = 8 h 47 min; Z ≈ 2.0), meaning this participant sleeps substantially longer than the sample average. However, this long sleep co-occurs with marked variability in timing and duration: sleep duration standard deviation ≈ 133 minutes (Z ≈ 0.73) and sleep start time standard deviation ≈ 140 minutes (Z ≈ 1.26). The median sleep onset is late (about 00:54), and naps are infrequent (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08). These features indicate extended total sleep opportunity on average but inconsistent sleep timing and notable night-to-night variability, both of which are commonly linked to poorer subjective sleep quality. Circadian estimates from heart rate show a clear nocturnal heart rate dip (hourly deviations between roughly -11 to -17 bpm overnight) and an acrophase in the late afternoon/early evening (≈ 5:23 PM). Interdaily stability (0.44, Z ≈ 0.25) and intradaily variability (0.56, Z ≈ 0.1) are near sample average, suggesting modestly regular rhythms with some within-day fragmentation. Resting heart rate is somewhat elevated relative to the sample (≈ 64 bpm, Z ≈ 0.7), which can reflect either fitness, stress/arousal, or other physiologic factors; its correlation with PSQI in this dataset is small (r ≈ 0.12).

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): There are competing signals. The long median sleep duration by wearable alone might be interpreted as adequate or even abundant objective sleep, which could favor a lower (better) PSQI. However, multiple other indicators point toward elevated risk of poorer subjective sleep: (1) pronounced depressive symptoms and elevated trait anxiety—both strongly associated with worse PSQI in this sample—(2) late average sleep timing with high night-to-night variability in sleep onset and duration (both variability metrics correlate positively with PSQI here), and (3) relatively frequent evening physiological activation (heart rate peaks in the evening hours) combined with above-average alcohol use frequency. The moderate interdaily stability does not fully offset the negative influence of affective symptoms and timing variability. Taken holistically, the weight of evidence (strong affective symptom burden, late and irregular sleep timing, and evening physiological arousal) favors an interpretation that the participant would report relatively poorer overall sleep quality compared with the study population.

Overall PSQI group assignment: Considering the strong association between depressive symptoms and PSQI in this dataset, the participant’s elevated CES-D score, elevated trait anxiety, late and inconsistent sleep timing, and other correlates of disturbed sleep outweigh the nominally long median sleep duration. Therefore it is more likely that this participant’s PSQI score would fall in the top half of the study distribution (indicating relatively poorer sleep quality).

Median sleep onset occurred near 02:56 AM, and median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 18 minutes (Z = -1.09), indicating shorter-than-average sleep relative to the study sample. Sleep duration also showed substantial night-to-night variability (standard deviation 143 minutes, Z = 0.96), and the participant took occasional naps (mean daily naps 0.22, Z = 1.75). Together, these features point to a pattern of late bedtimes, truncated nocturnal sleep, and irregular total sleep time across the semester—features that are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality.

Circadian structure and physiologic patterns. Summary circadian metrics derived from heart rate reveal reduced day-to-day regularity and elevated fragmentation: interdaily stability is low (0.28, Z = -1.07) while intradaily variability is high (0.88, Z = 2.36). Rhythm amplitude is relatively blunted (amplitude 6.78, Z = -1.29) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.18, Z = -1.20), suggesting a weak and inconsistent circadian signal in cardiovascular activity. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced overnight reductions (largest negative deviations between ~2–5 AM) consistent with consolidated sleep occurring in the early morning hours, but substantial positive deviations in the late evening (notably 10–11 PM: +14.19, Z = 1.22). This profile is consistent with late timing of sleep opportunity combined with elevated physiological activation into the late evening and an overall irregular circadian organization.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context. Self-report measures show low depressive and anxiety symptom levels (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07; STAI trait = 27, Z = -1.41) and relatively high self-esteem and happiness (self-esteem Z = 1.52; happiness Z = 1.64). Substance use is minimal. The participant reports limited solitary exercise but some social and recreational activity (socializing 2–3 hours, watching TV 1–2 hours). Stress is modestly elevated (score 24, Z = 0.65). Overall, mood and mental health indicators are favorable and would be expected to protect sleep; however, lifestyle choices and timing (late bedtimes, evening screen/media use) may undermine sleep consolidation and circadian regularity despite low symptom burden.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality (PSQI). The strongest objective signals associated with reduced sleep quality are the late median sleep start time (~02:56 AM), shorter-than-average nocturnal sleep (median ~6h18m, Z = -1.09), high night-to-night variability in sleep duration, increased nap frequency (Z = 1.75), and marked circadian irregularity (low interdaily stability Z = -1.07 and very high intradaily variability Z = 2.36). Elevated late-evening heart-rate deviations (10–11 PM) further suggest evening physiological activation that can interfere with sleep initiation. Although the participant reports low depression and anxiety and relatively high subjective well-being—factors that typically correlate with better sleep—these protective influences appear outweighed by objective markers of irregular timing, short and variable sleep, and circadian fragmentation. Correlations provided in the dataset (e.g., positive associations between sleep variability, naps, and PSQI) are consistent with these interpretations.

Overall PSQI group assignment. Balancing the objective wearable evidence (late timing, short and variable sleep, circadian fragmentation, late-evening physiological activation) against favorable self-reported mood, the preponderance of indicators points toward relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the study population. On balance, the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep).

34062,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report battery indicates generally favorable affective and psychosocial functioning alongside a notable, but not extreme, level of perceived stress. Depression and trait anxiety scores are low (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66; STAI = 36, Z = -0.52), and indices of well-being are elevated (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = +1.38; current happiness Z = +1.64; health satisfaction Z = +1.80). These positive psychosocial markers are correlated with better sleep in the study sample (self-esteem and happiness correlations with PSQI are negative; CES-D and STAI positively correlated with PSQI), so the participant’s low depressive and anxiety symptoms and high self-regard point toward relatively favorable subjective sleep quality. The participant does report higher-than-average perceived stress (Stress score = 26, Z = +1.19), which has a small positive correlation with PSQI in the cohort; this suggests stress could exert a modest adverse influence on sleep but is counterbalanced by other protective psychosocial factors.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle:
Habits that typically support sleep are present: frequent physical activity (exercising alone and with others three times a week or more; Z-scores > +1) and limited recreational drug use. Alcohol consumption is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z≈+1), which in this dataset shows negligible correlation with PSQI. Sedentary and evening screen-based recreational behaviors are low relative to peers. Daily nap frequency is low but slightly elevated versus the cohort mean (mean daily naps = 0.14, Z = +0.82). Overall, lifestyle and activity indicators—with relatively high exercise, low problematic substance use, and limited sedentary hobby time—are aligned with better sleep outcomes.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics:
Fitbit-derived sleep metrics indicate typical sleep quantity and modest night-to-night consistency. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 6 minutes (Z = -0.11), near the sample median, and night-to-night duration variability is somewhat lower than average (SD = 80 minutes, Z = -0.47). Median sleep start time is about 23:24 with a moderate start-time variability (SD = 95 minutes, Z = +0.26). These wearable sleep features (adequate duration, relatively low variability) are weakly associated with lower PSQI in the cohort, supporting a classification toward the better/average sleep range.

Physiological arousal and circadian structure:
Cardiovascular circadian features show a low overall cardiac mesor (mean heart rate MESOR = 58.7 bpm, Z = -2.08) and a low resting heart rate (45.7 bpm, Z = -1.48), which likely reflects high cardiovascular fitness rather than dysregulation. Cosinor amplitude is slightly reduced (amplitude Z = -0.40), and interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are below average (interdaily stability = 0.36, Z = -0.41; autocorrelation24 = 0.22, Z = -0.87), indicating modestly weaker day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms. Hourly aggregated deviations show expected night-time troughs (large negative deviations overnight) and robust morning and late-afternoon/evening elevations (notably 5–6pm and 6–7pm show high positive deviations, Z ≈ +2.0). In the cohort, reduced amplitude and somewhat lower circadian stability have modest relationships with poorer sleep, but correlations are small. The participant’s low mesor and low resting HR are not strongly associated with worse PSQI in this sample and more likely reflect fitness.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality:
Taken together, the multimodal evidence favors relatively good to average sleep quality. Objective sleep quantity and variability are near or slightly better than cohort medians, psychological risk factors for poor sleep (depression, anxiety) are minimal, and health-promoting behaviors (regular exercise, low recreational drug use, limited sedentary evening activities) are prominent. Countervailing signals for poorer sleep are limited: perceived stress is elevated (small positive PSQI correlate), circadian interdaily stability is somewhat reduced, amplitude is modestly lower, and there are prominent late-afternoon/evening heart-rate elevations—any of which could contribute modestly to sleep complaints for some individuals. However, the magnitudes of those adverse signals are small relative to the protective profile (positive well-being, adequate sleep duration, low variability), and several PSQI-correlated measures (low CES-D, STAI, high self-esteem, consistent sleep duration) strongly point toward lower PSQI scores.

Probabilistic conclusion about PSQI placement:
Balancing protective and adverse indicators and weighing the relative magnitudes and PSQI correlations, the preponderance of evidence indicates this participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of PSQI scores (i.e., better or average sleep quality) than in the top half. The combination of near-typical sleep duration, relatively stable night-to-night sleep, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, regular exercise, and high health satisfaction supports classification in the bottom 50% of the study’s PSQI distribution.

18111,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report data indicate elevated affective symptoms and perceived stress alongside otherwise normative self-regard and functioning. The CES-D score (27; Z = 1.42; classified “Depressed”) and trait anxiety (STAI = 48; Z = 0.66) are both above the sample mean and are positively correlated with worse PSQI in the cohort (CES-D: r = 0.49; STAI: r = 0.40). Self-rated happiness is low (current = 2; Z = −1.61) and stress is elevated (28; Z = 1.74), while Rosenberg self-esteem is only modestly below average (36; Z = −0.31). These patterns point to substantial affective burden and perceived stress during the recording period—factors that are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and higher PSQI scores.

Sleep habits and wearable sleep statistics:
Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is within a typical range (7 h 16 m; Z = 0.10), but there is notable instability in timing and amount. Night-to-night sleep duration variability is high (SD = 113 minutes; Z = 0.27) and sleep onset is late on average (median start ≈ 01:19 AM) with moderate nightly variability in start time (SD = 69 minutes; Z = −0.31). Daytime napping is above the sample mean (mean daily naps = 0.27; Z = 2.27). Taken together, the participant obtains an acceptable median total sleep time but exhibits irregular timing and frequent naps—behavioral features that often accompany or contribute to perceived sleep disturbance even when total time asleep is nominally adequate.

Circadian and heart-rate–derived metrics:
Heart-rate circadian metrics indicate a relatively weak and less stable 24-hour rhythm. Interdaily stability is low (0.24; Z = −1.40) and amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (amplitude = 6.21; Z = −1.48), while autocorrelation at 24 h is below average (0.21; Z = −0.95). The resting heart rate is typical for the sample (58.2 bpm; Z ≈ 0.0), but the hourly aggregated deviation profile shows marked nocturnal reductions from the mesor (largest negative deviations between ~3:00–7:00 AM, up to −12.7 bpm) and prominent relative elevations in the late evening (notably 8–9 PM: +20.1 bpm; Z = 1.85). This combination—reduced circadian amplitude and stability, plus elevated evening cardiovascular activity—is consistent with a pattern of weakened or shifted peripheral circadian expression and relatively greater physiological arousal in the evening hours, which aligns with the late habitual sleep onset.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
There is a divergence between objective duration and indicators of sleep regularity/physiological arousal. The participant’s adequate median sleep duration would, in isolation, support a lower/average PSQI; however, multiple converging signals point toward compromised sleep quality: (1) elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress (all positively correlated with higher PSQI in the sample); (2) high variability in sleep duration and timing and elevated napping (behaviors that typically worsen subjective sleep and PSQI components related to sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction); and (3) circadian measures showing low interdaily stability and amplitude plus elevated evening heart-rate deviations, consistent with delayed/fragmented sleep physiology and evening arousal. These psychological and physiological features are more strongly aligned with higher PSQI (poorer sleep quality) than with sustained good sleep.

Evaluation of PSQI group membership:
Evidence for better/median PSQI (bottom 50): median sleep duration near sample average and normal resting heart rate argue that total sleep time and baseline cardiovascular health are not severely impaired. Evidence for poorer PSQI (top 50): elevated depressive symptoms and stress, late and variable sleep timing, frequent naps (Z = 2.27), low interdaily stability (Z = −1.40), low amplitude (Z = −1.48), and marked evening heart-rate elevations (8–9 PM Z = 1.85) are all associated with worse PSQI and subjective sleep complaints. Considering the relative weight of affective burden, circadian irregularity, evening physiological arousal, and behavioral instability, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to have a PSQI score in the higher half of the study distribution (worse sleep quality).

59097,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports elevated affective symptoms: a high level of depressive symptoms (CES‑D = 28, Z = 1.53) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56), accompanied by low self-reported happiness (score = 2, Z = -1.61) and slightly below-average self-esteem (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31). These self-report indicators are the strongest psychological signals in the dataset and are meaningfully related to poorer sleep in this cohort (CES‑D correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.49; STAI correlation ≈ 0.40; self-esteem correlation ≈ -0.35). Lifestyle signals that could influence sleep include modest weekly alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 0.9–1.0) and relatively infrequent exercise (exercise alone or with others 1–2 times/month). Overall, the behavioral and affective profile points to elevated psychological distress and some lifestyle factors (alcohol, low exercise) that are associated with worse subjective sleep quality in this population.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability (wearable + self-report):
Objectively recorded nocturnal sleep quantity is above the cohort average: median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 23 minutes (Z = 1.50). The participant napped rarely (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86) and shows relatively low night-to-night variability in sleep timing (sleep start time standard deviation = 38 minutes, Z = -0.99) and moderate stability in sleep duration (duration SD = 74 minutes, Z = -0.62). However, sleep timing is late: median sleep start is about 01:07 AM. In sum, sleep is longer and reasonably consistent in timing but predominantly shifted to late-night hours — a pattern that can preserve total sleep time while nonetheless producing subjective complaints about sleep quality, daytime functioning, or alignment with daytime obligations.

Circadian and cardiac physiology:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a well-structured and robust rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.57, Z = 1.33) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.47, Z = 1.23) are elevated, and intradaily variability is low (0.33, Z = -1.52), reflecting consistent day-to-day timing and low fragmentation of activity/rest cycles. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is relatively high (14.74, Z = 1.28) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 4:49 PM), and resting heart rate is within a typical range (58.6 bpm, Z = 0.05). Hourly mean deviations from the mesor show the expected large nocturnal reductions and afternoon/evening elevations. Overall, the wearable-derived physiology suggests consolidated, regular circadian organization and intact diurnal modulation of cardiovascular arousal.

Integration and likely PSQI placement:
Evidence from two domains diverges. Objective wearable measures show protective features for sleep health — long median sleep duration, low fragmentation, regular timing across days, robust circadian amplitude — all factors that typically associate with better objective sleep consolidation. By contrast, subjective and behavioral indicators (notably elevated depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety, low happiness, and moderate-weekly alcohol use) are robust predictors of poorer subjective sleep in this cohort (CES‑D and STAI have substantial positive correlations with PSQI). The PSQI is a largely subjective measure that captures perceived sleep quality, latency, disturbances and daytime dysfunction; given the participant’s elevated affective symptoms and their relatively strong correlation with PSQI in this sample, the balance of evidence supports the expectation that this participant would report worse sleep quality than average despite objectively long and regular sleep. Additional contributors to worse subjective sleep could include late habitual bedtimes and alcohol use. On balance, the psychological symptom burden and its known association with higher PSQI scores outweigh the protective objective circadian profile for predicting the participant’s PSQI placement.

Conclusion:
Given the combination of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (which correlate strongly with PSQI), late habitual sleep timing, and some alcohol use — despite objectively long and regular sleep — the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the cohort distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively poorer reported sleep).

24833,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and self-reported behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report measures indicate generally low levels of affective symptoms and moderate perceived health. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) and trait anxiety (STAI = 33, Z = -0.82) are both below the study mean, and perceived stress is modest (Score = 20, Z = -0.44). Self-reported happiness is slightly below average (Z = -0.53) while health satisfaction is relatively high (Z = 0.8). Social and recreational patterns are typical for the sample: moderate alcohol use (beer and wine 1–2 times/week with Z ≈ 1.0), limited recreational drug use, modest exercise frequency (1–2 times/week), and little daytime napping. These self-report indicators do not strongly signal affective disturbance that would by themselves predict markedly poor sleep quality, but the elevated alcohol-use Z-scores and somewhat lower-reported happiness are relevant contextual behaviors to consider in combination with physiological measures.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological summary:
Cardiovascular circadian metrics show a pattern of reduced rhythm robustness and lower day-to-day regularity. Interdaily stability is low (0.17, Z = -1.98) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is also low (0.11, Z = -1.79), indicating that daily heart-rate patterns are less consistent across days than most participants. Amplitude is reduced (5.9, Z = -1.58) while mesor and resting heart rate are slightly above average (Mesor Z = 0.4; Resting HR = 64.7, Z = 0.78). Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.61, Z = 0.46), consistent with more within-day fragmentation of physiology. Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–8:00 AM) and a late-afternoon/early-evening peak (acrophase ~5:40 PM, with a notable +14 bpm deviation around 5–6 PM). Together, these features indicate preserved day–night separation of cardiovascular state but with weakened amplitude and poor stability across days—patterns that are commonly linked to circadian irregularity.

Sleep timing, duration, and day-to-day variability:
Median nightly sleep duration is near seven hours (6 h 55 m, Z = -0.32), close to the sample central tendency and not markedly short. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD ≈ 98 minutes, Z = -0.07) is near the cohort average, and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86), suggesting the participant typically consolidates sleep at night. The striking behavioral feature is very late sleep timing: median sleep start time is ~02:10 AM with a moderate night-to-night start-time SD (85 minutes). This delayed timing places sleep opportunity in the early morning hours and, when combined with low interdaily stability, suggests an irregular and late sleep schedule relative to the study population.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality:
Taken together, the profile shows a mix of neutral-to-protective and risk-related signals for sleep quality. Objective sleep quantity is near-average and the absence of daytime napping suggests reasonably consolidated nocturnal sleep, while low depressive and anxiety symptom scores further reduce risk for severe subjective sleep disturbance. However, the participant exhibits pronounced circadian irregularity (very low interdaily stability and low 24-hour autocorrelation), reduced circadian amplitude, and a consistently late sleep onset (median ~02:10 AM). These circadian disturbances (Z-scores near or below -1.5 to -2.0 for stability and amplitude measures) are salient and are known to be associated with poorer subjective sleep quality independent of total sleep time. Moderate weekly alcohol use and a slightly elevated resting heart rate add contextual factors that can further degrade sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality. On balance, the balance of evidence—particularly the robust, sample-relative deviations in circadian regularity and late timing—leans toward a higher likelihood of relatively poorer PSQI-rated sleep compared with the median participant.

Conclusion regarding PSQI distribution:
Considering the combination of late and irregular sleep timing, weak circadian stability and amplitude (Z ≲ -1.5 to -2.0), and contextual behavioral risk factors (moderate alcohol use, slightly elevated resting HR), the participant’s pattern is more consistent with participants in the upper half (worse sleep quality) of the study PSQI distribution than with those in the lower half. Although total sleep duration and affective symptom scores are not strongly adverse, the magnitude of circadian irregularity is the dominant indicator here.

84502,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports a mixed psychological profile. Depressive symptom scores (CES-D = 18, Z = 0.49) are elevated relative to the study sample, and current self-rated happiness is below average (3.0, Z = -0.53). Trait anxiety is slightly below sample mean (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) while self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average (RSES Z ≈ 0.4; health satisfaction Z = 0.72). Reported stress is modestly elevated (Score = 23, Z = 0.38). The participant also reports minimal substance use and relatively frequent social/partnered exercise (exercising with others ≥3×/week, Z = 1.23), which are behaviors that typically support sleep health. Of these self-report features, the strongest PSQI-relevant signal is the moderate positive correlation between depressive symptom burden and worse PSQI in the sample (CES-D correlation ~0.49); this suggests that the participant’s elevated depressive symptoms could contribute to poorer subjective sleep, even if some other psychosocial indicators are favorable.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns:
Physiological and circadian measures from the wearable show a well-structured, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.55, Z = 1.16) and 24‑hour autocorrelation is above average (Z = 0.81), indicating consistent day-to-day timing of heart rate patterns. Mesor (mean-level) is lower than the sample mean (67.03, Z = -0.94) and resting heart rate is low (52.6 bpm, Z = -0.66), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or parasympathetic tone. Amplitude is modestly elevated (Z = 0.53) and the acrophase (peak heart rate ~4:08 PM) is in the expected afternoon window. Hourly deviations show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (large negative deviations between ~12–6 AM) and strong daytime peaks (notably 4–6 PM with large positive Z-scores), consistent with clear nocturnal downregulation and robust daytime activation. Overall, these wearable-derived features point to coherent circadian structure and physiological patterns typically associated with restorative sleep.

Sleep behavior and objective sleep statistics:
Objective sleep metrics derived from the wearable suggest generally adequate sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 31 minutes (Z = 0.41), i.e., modestly above the sample mean. Night-to-night variability in duration is present but not extreme (SD ≈ 109 minutes, Z = 0.18), and the median sleep start time is shortly after midnight (00:19) with moderate consistency (start-time SD Z = -0.39). The participant records essentially no napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Correlations in the sample show only minor associations between these objective sleep quantities and PSQI (sleep duration correlation ≈ 0.05), suggesting that objective duration and timing alone do not strongly predict PSQI in this cohort; nonetheless, the pattern here is compatible with sufficient nightly sleep and a relatively stable schedule.

Integrated interpretation and likely PSQI placement:
Integrating subjective and objective sources yields a mixed but overall favorable sleep profile. Objective physiology and behavior (adequate median sleep duration, strong nocturnal heart rate decline, high interdaily stability, no naps) point toward relatively good sleep physiology and a consistent circadian schedule—features that usually correspond to better PSQI scores. Against that, elevated depressive symptoms and lower self-reported happiness, together with small positive associations between depressive symptoms and PSQI in the sample, represent the principal signal that could elevate subjective sleep complaints. However, the magnitude of objective indicators of healthy sleep and circadian regularity is substantial and consistent across multiple wearable metrics. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports the participant having overall sleep quality in the lower half of the study’s PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep), with the caveat that elevated depressive symptoms could increase subjective complaints even when objective sleep is adequate.

78783,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Sleep timing, duration, and variability
The wearable-recorded sleep profile shows a consistent pattern of late and irregular sleep timing. Median sleep onset occurred at approximately 02:51 AM, which is substantially delayed relative to typical student schedules and is accompanied by very high night-to-night variability in start times (sleep start SD = 173 minutes; Z = 1.99). Median nightly sleep duration was about 6 hours 52 minutes (Z = -0.39), slightly below the study mean, but the more salient feature is large night-to-night variability in total sleep time (duration SD = 151 minutes; Z = 1.13). The participant also averaged a nontrivial number of naps (0.26/day; Z = 2.23), suggesting compensatory daytime sleep. Taken together, late bedtimes, large variability in both timing and duration, and frequent napping indicate an irregular sleep schedule with inconsistent consolidated nighttime sleep.

Circadian physiology and aggregated heart-rate patterns
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a moderately structured but not highly stable rhythm. Interdaily stability is below average (0.36, Z = -0.41) while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.58, Z = 0.24), implying that day-to-day timing of the rhythm is relatively unstable and there is modest fragmentation within days. Mesor and resting heart rate are both lower than the sample mean (mesor = 69.7, Z = -0.58; resting HR = 52.8, Z = -0.64), consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness, which aligns with the participant’s above-average exercise frequency (exercise alone ≥3×/week, Z = 1.07). Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced decreases overnight (largest negative deviations between ~3–8 AM) and notable positive deviations in the evening, with especially elevated deviations at 10–11 PM (value = +16.47, Z = 1.58) and several hours in the early evening (e.g., 7–9 PM). This evening elevation in cardiovascular tone (relative to the participant’s mesor) suggests increased physiological arousal across the late evening, which could interfere with sleep initiation given the very late median sleep onset.

Psychological traits, lifestyle, and behaviors relevant to sleep
Self-report mood and trait anxiety show mixed indicators. Depressive symptoms are near the sample mean (CES-D = 13, Z = -0.03) but trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17); both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), linking them to worse subjective sleep in the cohort. The participant reports low current happiness (score = 2, Z = -1.61) and relatively low health satisfaction (Z = -1.11), though self-esteem is high (RSES = 39). Lifestyle factors include frequent exercise, moderate monthly alcohol use, and above-average time spent playing video games (video games Z = 1.71), which may contribute to late-night schedules. Several features that typically relate to poorer sleep—late bedtimes, high timing variability, frequent napping, and elevated evening physiological arousal—are present alongside modest anxiety and low subjective happiness.

Integrated interpretation for PSQI-related sleep quality
The combination of very late median sleep onset, large variability in sleep timing and duration, frequent naps, and elevated evening heart-rate deviations together point toward fragmented and irregular sleep that is likely perceived as poorer sleep quality. Although total nightly sleep duration is only slightly below average and resting heart rate is low (a potentially protective sign), the behavioral and physiological markers most strongly associated with adverse PSQI scores in this dataset are prominent for this participant (late/variable bedtimes, evening arousal, and variability metrics). Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms—both moderately correlated with PSQI—are present at levels that could exacerbate perceived sleep problems. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors placement in the half of the sample with relatively poorer sleep quality.

The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 50; Z ≈ 0.86) and above-average perceived stress (Score = 25; Z ≈ 0.92), alongside relatively low momentary happiness (Z ≈ -0.53). Depressive symptom burden is low-to-none on the CES-D (score = 10; Z ≈ -0.34). Self-reported health satisfaction is high (6.44 on a 1–7 scale; Z ≈ 1.63). Alcohol use is present at a moderate weekly frequency (beer and wine/liquor 1–2×/week) but recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Physical activity is modest (exercise alone or with others ~1–2×/week; limited sports participation). Taken together, the psychosocial profile shows elevated anxiety/stress that could adversely affect subjective sleep experience, despite generally positive health satisfaction and limited substance use.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological signals:
Cardiovascular rhythms are well-structured on several indices. Interdaily stability is near the population mean (0.42; Z ≈ 0.09), intradaily variability is lower than average (0.47; Z ≈ -0.53), and autocorrelation at 24h is modest (0.28; Z ≈ -0.36). Cosinor-derived features show a relatively low MESOR (mean heart rate ≈ 67.7 bpm; Z ≈ -0.85) and a moderate-to-large amplitude (12.8; Z ≈ 0.64), with acrophase in the mid-afternoon (≈ 4:02 PM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.4 bpm; Z ≈ -0.68), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregated deviations show a substantial nocturnal trough (peak negative deviations around ~4–6 AM of roughly -20 to -22 bpm relative to mesor) and a pronounced daytime elevation centered in the mid-afternoon (notably +38 bpm at 3–4 PM, Z ≈ 5.3). Overall, the wearable data indicate a strong, consolidated circadian pattern with clear daytime activation and deep nighttime lowering of heart rate.

Objective sleep timing and variability:
Nighttime sleep is relatively consistent: median sleep duration is 6 hours 34 minutes (Z ≈ -0.77), sleep duration standard deviation ≈ 61 minutes (Z ≈ -0.91), and sleep start time median is late (≈ 01:45:45 AM) with a moderate start-time SD (~56 minutes; Z ≈ -0.58). Mean daily naps are effectively zero. These metrics indicate relatively stable sleep from night to night (lower-than-average variability), but a habitual late sleep onset and objectively shorter-than-average total sleep time compared with the study population.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
The data present a mixed but coherent picture. Objective physiology and rhythm metrics suggest good consolidation of sleep (low intradaily fragmentation, deep nocturnal heart-rate troughs, and a robust daytime–nighttime contrast), which would tend to protect sleep quality. In contrast, behavioral and subjective risk factors point toward sleep compromise: a late habitual sleep onset (~1:45 AM) and a median nightly sleep duration below the cohort mean (~6.5 hours) reduce sleep opportunity, and elevated trait anxiety and stress—both positively correlated with poorer PSQI in the sample (STAI r ≈ 0.40; stress r ≈ 0.20)—would be expected to worsen subjective sleep quality. The participant’s consistent sleep timing and low night-to-night variability mitigate some risk, but do not fully offset the combination of late timing, restricted duration, and elevated anxiety. Correlations between wearable/survey features and PSQI are generally small-to-modest, but the strongest available predictor in this profile is anxiety, which aligns with worse PSQI.

PSQI group judgment:
Balancing the relatively strong circadian consolidation against late sleep timing, shortened sleep duration, and elevated anxiety/stress (which has a moderate positive correlation with poorer PSQI), the overall evidence favors placement in the higher-PSQI (worse sleep quality) half of the study population.

Median nightly sleep duration was 8 hours 49 minutes (Z = +2.03), placing this participant well above the study mean for sleep time, and naps were effectively absent (mean daily naps = 0.0; Z = -0.86). Median sleep start time was about 22:50 with a moderate night-to-night start time standard deviation (~79 minutes; Z ≈ -0.09), consistent with a generally stable bedtime. Sleep duration variability (SD = 94 minutes; Z ≈ -0.15) is near the cohort average. Collectively, these wearable-derived sleep metrics point to objectively long and reasonably regular nocturnal sleep across the recording period.

Circadian physiology and heart rate patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian measures show a coherent day–night separation with a relatively low overall mesor (69.5 bpm; Z = -0.61) and a low resting heart rate (54.9 bpm; Z = -0.39). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor are strongly negative overnight (approximately −15 to −19 bpm across midnight–6am; several Z-scores markedly negative) and strongly positive in the late-morning window (peaking ~9–11am with deviations up to +19.7 bpm and Z-scores > +1.9). The cosinor acrophase is in the mid-afternoon (≈ 2:42 PM), indicating midday–afternoon timing of peak cardiovascular activity. Non-parametric circadian indices show modest interdaily stability (0.38; Z ≈ -0.24) and a slightly elevated intradaily variability (0.60; Z ≈ +0.39), suggesting a generally regular 24-hour structure with some within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology. The pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reduction and low resting heart rate are consistent with good nocturnal autonomic downregulation despite the modestly increased within-day variability.

Psychological traits and lifestyle context relevant to sleep: Self-report measures indicate low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 11; Z ≈ -0.24) but an elevated trait anxiety score (STAI = 47; Z ≈ +0.56). Perceived stress is relatively low (Stress score = 19; Z ≈ -0.71), health satisfaction is above average, and self-esteem is slightly below the cohort mean but not markedly so. Lifestyle factors that commonly support sleep—low substance use (no alcohol or recreational drug use) and frequent exercise and sports participation (exercise and sports Z-scores +1.07 and +1.58 respectively)—are pronounced. Daily social and sedentary recreational activities are low. Taken together, the behavioral profile (regular exercise, minimal substance use, stable bedtimes) and low stress levels are consistent with objective sleep preservation; the isolated elevation in trait anxiety could relate to subjective sleep complaints for some people, but the depressive symptom level and stress indicators do not suggest a strong adverse influence on sleep here.

Integration and implication for PSQI ranking: Objective wearable data show long, regular nocturnal sleep, clear nocturnal heart-rate reduction, and minimal napping—features typically associated with better sleep quality on multi-domain instruments like the PSQI. Circadian metrics indicate a coherent day–night pattern though with a modest increase in intraday variability, which could contribute mild fragmentation but is unlikely to outweigh the strong indicators of adequate sleep duration and nocturnal recovery. Psychological correlates that are most strongly associated with poor PSQI in the cohort (CES-D, STAI) show only a modest elevation of trait anxiety and low depressive burden for this participant; other protective factors (low stress, high exercise, low substance use) further support relatively good overall sleep. On balance, the preponderance of evidence—objective long sleep duration (Z = +2.03), regular bed timing, low napping, favorable autonomic night-time physiology, and health-promoting lifestyle behaviors—indicates this participant’s global sleep quality is more consistent with the lower half of PSQI scores in the study population (i.e., relatively good/average sleep). Therefore, this participant is likely to fall in the bottom 50th percentile of PSQI scores (better/average sleep quality).

70125,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports elevated affective symptoms, with a CES-D score of 24 (Z = 1.11, classified “Depressed”) and a trait anxiety score of 50 (Z = 0.86, classified “anxious”), alongside a notably high perceived stress score (29; Z = 2.01). These measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating that higher depressive and anxiety symptom burden is associated with worse subjective sleep quality in this population. Self-esteem is approximately average (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11), while trust and health satisfaction are relatively low (trust Z = -1.74; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95), which may reflect lower perceived social and physical well-being that can compound sleep-related distress. The participant also reports routine moderate weekly alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2×/week) and frequent solo exercise (≥3×/week), the latter corresponding with a relatively low resting heart rate and may provide some resilience against sleep disruption.

Sleep behavior and wearable sleep statistics: Objective sleep duration median is just under seven hours (6 h 57 min; Z = -0.29), suggesting total nightly sleep time on average is only slightly below the study mean. However, night-to-night variability is high: sleep duration SD = 159 minutes (Z = 1.32) and sleep start time median at ~01:44 AM with sleep start SD ≈ 99 minutes (Z = 0.36). These large intra-individual variabilities indicate an irregular sleep schedule with frequent changes in both timing and duration. Napping is rare (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08). Correlations in the dataset show modest positive associations between sleep timing/duration variability and PSQI (sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20; sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18), supporting the interpretation that variability in this participant’s sleep pattern is likely contributing to poorer subjective sleep quality.

Circadian and heart rate-derived patterns: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian features suggest a relatively weak and less stable 24-hour heart rate rhythm. Interdaily stability is low (0.34, Z = -0.57) and amplitude is reduced (9.18, Z = -0.52), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is low (0.24, Z = -0.70). These findings indicate reduced day-to-day regularity and a blunted circadian amplitude in heart rate. Resting heart rate is low (53 bpm, Z = -0.61), consistent with higher cardiovascular fitness likely related to frequent exercise. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal reductions (largest negative deviations between ~2–5 AM) and a pronounced relative evening elevation around 7–8 PM (deviation ≈ +17.4, Z ≈ 1.03), suggesting greater physiological arousal in the evening hours. Some of the nighttime heart rate deviations (e.g., 2–4 AM) have small positive correlations with PSQI, consistent with nocturnal arousal being associated with worse subjective sleep.

Synthesis and PSQI placement: The participant presents a mixed profile: objectively they achieve near-seven-hour median sleep and are physically fit, which are supportive of adequate sleep sufficiency, but they also exhibit late average sleep timing (~1:45 AM), substantial night-to-night variability in duration and timing, reduced circadian stability and amplitude, and elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms and stress—factors that have established and observed associations with worse subjective sleep quality within this sample (notably CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI). The balance of evidence favors greater subjective sleep disturbance driven by irregular timing, psychological distress, and evening physiological arousal rather than straightforward short sleep alone. Considering the moderate-to-strong correlations of affective symptoms with PSQI and the marked variability/irregularity in sleep timing, the participant is more consistent with being in the higher (worse) half of PSQI scores in this study population.

67192,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report profile indicates elevated affective symptoms and psychosocial strain. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 32, Z = 1.95) and trait anxiety (STAI = 58, Z = 1.65) are both well above the cohort mean, and perceived stress is markedly high (Stress = 31, Z = 2.55). Concurrently, measures of positive psychosocial functioning are comparatively low: self-esteem is below average (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73), happiness is reduced (Current Happy = 2.0, Z = -1.61), trust of others is low (Z = -2.39), and health satisfaction is low (Z = -2.03). Behavioral reports show limited exercise (exercise alone or with others 1–2×/week), minimal substance use except modest alcohol (wine/liquor 1–2×/week), high social time (socializing >4 hours, Z = 2.53), and above-average engagement with video games (Z = 2.47). The pattern is consistent with a student experiencing significant mood and stress burden alongside social engagement and some evening recreational behaviors.

Sleep behavior and wearable-recorded sleep statistics:
Objectively recorded sleep duration is near the cohort median (median nightly sleep = 7 h 16 m, Z = 0.10), and daytime naps are infrequent (mean naps/day = 0.13, Z = 0.70). However, timing and regularity of sleep are notable: median sleep start time is late (01:15 AM) and night-to-night variability is substantial (sleep duration SD ≈ 108 minutes, Z = 0.16; sleep start SD ≈ 110 minutes, Z = 0.59). These features indicate that, although total sleep time is on average adequate, the participant has delayed and inconsistent sleep timing. The observed associations in the dataset (sleep timing variability correlating positively with PSQI) suggest that this irregularity and late timing are likely to contribute to worse subjective sleep quality despite normative total duration.

Physiological circadian and arousal markers from wearable data:
Cardiovascular circadian measures show a relatively stable daily rhythm (interdaily stability = 0.52, Z = 0.91; autocorrelation at 24 h = 0.47, Z = 1.23) and modest fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.5, Z = -0.32), implying an organized but not highly robust activity-rest rhythm. The mesor is elevated (MESOR = 88.7 bpm, Z = 2.01) and resting heart rate is higher than typical for the sample (RHR = 71.8 bpm, Z = 1.62), consistent with heightened baseline physiological arousal. Hourly aggregated deviations show pronounced heart-rate reductions overnight (largest negative deviations ~-17 to -21 bpm between ~3–6 AM) and relatively large positive deviations in the evening and late night (notably 10–11 PM deviation = +16.3 bpm, Z = 1.55). The elevated evening/late-night heart-rate relative to mesor suggests physiological activation late in the night, which can interfere with sleep initiation and subjective sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation with respect to PSQI:
Putting these modalities together, the participant presents a mixed but concerning picture for sleep quality. Protective elements include an average total sleep duration (≈7 h 16 m) and evidence of an organized 24-h rhythm (moderate interdaily stability and high 24-h autocorrelation). Contrastingly, multiple risk factors for poorer subjective sleep quality are present: late median sleep onset (≈1:15 AM) with high night-to-night variability, elevated baseline physiological arousal (mesor and resting HR high), and marked affective distress (high depression and anxiety, high perceived stress). Behavioral correlates—evening recreational activities and meaningful evening physiological peaks—also align with delayed/activated evenings. Given the relatively strong correlations reported between depressive symptoms and PSQI in this sample (CES-D correlation ≈ 0.50) and the associations of sleep timing variability and evening arousal with worse PSQI, the balance of evidence indicates that this participant is more likely to report poorer overall sleep quality than the median participant, even though objective total sleep time is adequate.

Conclusion — PSQI group assignment:
Based on the multimodal synthesis—particularly the high affective symptom burden, elevated resting and evening heart rate, late and irregular bedtimes, and the empirically observed associations of these factors with PSQI—the participant is more likely to fall into the higher-PSQI (worse sleep quality) half of the study distribution.

97448,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The self-report data indicate a generally low symptom burden for mood and anxiety: CES-D = 3 (Z = -1.07) and STAI-Trait = 33 (Z = -0.82), both well below the study mean and associated in the sample with better sleep (positive correlations between symptom scores and PSQI mean that lower symptom scores tend to relate to lower PSQI). Stress and current happiness are slightly below average (Stress Z = -0.44; Happy Z = -0.53), and self-esteem and interpersonal trust are at or above the group average (SelfEsteem Z = 0.4; Trust Z = 1.47). The participant reports regular exercise (exercising alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07) and limited recreational drug use, with modest alcohol use (beer/wine or liquor 1–2 times per week). Taken together, these psychosocial and lifestyle indicators (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, modest stress, regular exercise, and high trust) are factors that generally align with better subjective sleep quality in this sample.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability: Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of about 7 hours 12 minutes (Z = 0.02), which is essentially at the study average and within the range usually considered adequate. Night-to-night variability in total sleep time is lower than average (SD = 63 minutes, Z = -0.86), and variability in sleep start time is also below average (SD = 63 minutes, Z = -0.43), indicating relatively consistent sleep timing and duration across days. However, the participant’s typical sleep onset is late (median sleep start ~01:44 AM). Napping is infrequent (mean daily naps = 0.13, Z = 0.7). In sum, the participant tends to obtain an objectively adequate and consistent amount of nocturnal sleep but on a late schedule.

Physiological circadian and cardiac features: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a well-structured diurnal rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.53, Z = 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (Z = 1.15), indicating consistent daily organization of heart rate across days. Amplitude is higher than average (Amplitude Z = 1.29), while intradaily variability is near average (Z = -0.04). Resting heart rate is low relative to the sample (50.8 bpm, Z = -0.87), consistent with cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show a clear nocturnal trough (large negative deviations during the 1–7 AM window) and afternoon/evening peaks, with acrophase around 5:00 PM — a profile consistent with consolidated nighttime sleep and daytime activity. These physiological markers (stable circadian structure, high amplitude, clear nocturnal cardiac down-regulation, and low resting HR) typically associate with consolidated sleep and better sleep physiology.

Integration and implications for sleep quality: There are two competing features relevant to PSQI-based sleep quality. On one hand, adequate total sleep time, low night-to-night variability, minimal napping, low depressive/anxiety symptoms, low stress, regular exercise, and stable, high-amplitude circadian physiology all favor relatively good/average PSQI scores. On the other hand, the participant’s habitual late sleep onset (median ~1:44 AM) represents a late chronotype that can increase subjective difficulties with sleep timing and daytime functioning in some contexts and could contribute to higher PSQI component scores related to sleep latency or daytime dysfunction. Given the size and direction of the available indicators, the weight of evidence favors preserved objective sleep duration and stable circadian organization together with low psychological symptom burden—factors that typically reduce overall PSQI. The late sleep timing is the main factor that would push the PSQI upward, but it does not appear, within the available multimodal data, to be accompanied by short sleep duration, high variability, elevated physiological arousal at night, or elevated mood/anxiety symptoms that would strongly indicate poor global sleep quality.

Overall PSQI group assignment: Balancing the objective wearable measures and the self-report traits and behaviors, the preponderance of evidence suggests this participant’s global sleep quality as measured by PSQI is likely in the lower half (better/average sleep quality) of the study distribution rather than the upper half.

67177,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate elevated affective and stress-related symptoms alongside low positive well-being and limited physical activity. The participant’s CES-D score is 16 (Z = 0.28) and trait anxiety (STAI) is 46 (Z = 0.46); both scores are above the sample mean and have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this study (CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40), which suggests these features are likely to co-occur with poorer subjective sleep quality. Self-esteem (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01), current happiness (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61), and health satisfaction (score = 2.67, Z = -1.2) are comparatively low; these variables are negatively correlated with PSQI (higher self-esteem/happiness associated with better sleep), so the participant’s low scores on positive well-being are consistent with risk for worse PSQI. Stress is relatively elevated (score = 25, Z = 0.92), which also aligns with a sleep-disrupting profile. Lifestyle measures show minimal substance use but very low reported exercise (no exercise across categories, Z-scores highly negative) and moderately high sedentary/recreational screen time (watching TV/videos 1–2 hours, Z = 1.28; internet 2–3 hours, Z = 0.85), a combination that tends to associate with reduced sleep quality in young adults.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a generally regular and structured daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is relatively high (0.56, Z = 1.24) and autocorrelation at 24 hours is elevated (0.49, Z = 1.40), while intradaily variability is comparatively low (0.44, Z = -0.74). Together these indicate consistent day-to-day timing of activity/arousal with relatively low fragmentation of the rhythm. The mesor (mean modeled HR) is elevated (82.08 bpm, Z = 1.11) and resting heart rate is also above the sample mean (65.2 bpm, Z = 0.84), suggesting a higher baseline cardiovascular level across the recording period. Amplitude is modestly above average (13.32, Z = 0.82) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (4:34 PM), and hourly deviations show a clear nocturnal decline in heart rate (roughly −10 to −20 beats relative to mesor between midnight and 6 AM) and pronounced evening peaks (several hours in the late afternoon and early evening ~ +10–+18 beats). The overall pattern is physiologically coherent (normal nocturnal dipping and robust daytime elevation) but the elevated mesor/resting HR could reflect greater tonic arousal or reduced cardiovascular deconditioning relative to peers.

Sleep timing and quantity characteristics: Objective Fitbit summary metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 54 minutes (Z = -0.35), with a sleep duration standard deviation of ~100 minutes (Z ≈ -0.01) and a median sleep start time shortly after midnight (00:22). Napping was minimal (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). The participant’s habitual sleep period is slightly shorter than a full 7–9 hour recommendation but not severely truncated; variability in timing and duration is moderate (sleep start SD = 87 minutes). The combination of a near-midnight bedtime, sub-7-hour median sleep, and elevated psychological distress factors points toward subjective sleep concerns even though objective night-to-night variability is not extreme and naps are uncommon.

Integration and inference about sleep quality (PSQI distribution): Several lines of evidence point toward relatively poorer subjective sleep quality. The strongest contributors are the elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both of which have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample), elevated stress, low happiness and low self-esteem (features that are negatively correlated with good sleep), plus lifestyle factors that reduce sleep resilience (no exercise, increased screen time). Objective wearable indicators provide mixed evidence: circadian regularity and clear nocturnal heart-rate dipping argue for stable sleep timing (which tends to support better sleep), and median nightly sleep is close to 7 hours; however, the elevated mesor and resting heart rate, late sleep onset, and psychological risk profile favor worse subjective sleep. Given the relatively strong associations between the participant’s affective symptoms and PSQI in this dataset (notably CES-D r = 0.49 and STAI r = 0.40), combined with low positive well-being and minimal exercise, the balance of evidence is that this participant is more likely to fall in the higher PSQI range (worse sleep) compared with the study population median.

87328,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The self-report data indicate a psychologically resilient profile and few traditional psychosocial risk factors for poor sleep. The participant reports minimal depressive symptoms (CES-D score = 0; Z = -1.38) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 23; Z = -1.81), along with elevated self-esteem and positive affect (RSES Z = 1.66; current happiness Z = 1.64). Reported stress is low (Z = -1.8). Substance use is essentially absent across beer, wine/liquor, and non-prescribed drugs. These survey indicators — which, in this sample, correlate in the expected directions with PSQI (depression and anxiety positively correlated with worse PSQI; self-esteem and happiness negatively correlated) — point toward a lower likelihood of affective contributors to poor sleep quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological patterns:
Fitbit-derived circadian metrics show a robust, regular heart-rate rhythm. Interdaily stability is above average (0.53; Z = 1.0), intradaily variability is low (0.51; Z = -0.25), autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (0.51; Z = 1.57), and cosinor amplitude is elevated (16.28; Z = 1.78). Resting heart rate is low (54.4 bpm; Z = -0.45), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–6:00 AM) and an evening peak (notably ~6–7 PM, +27.6; Z = 2.62). Collectively, these features indicate stable daily structure, clear day–night separation in physiological arousal, and likely good cardiovascular recovery overnight — characteristics that typically associate with better objective sleep consolidation and quality.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Nightly sleep metrics show a median sleep duration of 7 hours 25 minutes (Z = 0.3), with relatively low night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 76 minutes; Z = -0.57) and a fairly consistent sleep onset time (median start ~01:26 AM; start-time SD = 50 minutes; Z = -0.72). Mean daily naps are low (0.18/day) though slightly elevated relative to the sample (Z = 1.21). Overall sleep opportunity and stability are adequate in duration and more consistent than average, but the sleep timing is late (habitual sleep onset about 1:26 AM). Late but consistent timing can reflect a delayed chronotype; because variability is low and circadian amplitude/stability are high, this late timing appears to be a stable pattern rather than an irregular schedule.

Integration and interpretation relative to PSQI:
Balancing the inputs, multiple lines of evidence favor relatively good sleep quality. Psychological risk factors for poor sleep are minimal (very low depressive and anxiety symptoms, strong self-esteem and happiness). Wearable-derived circadian measures indicate a highly regular, high-amplitude rhythm and pronounced nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation — physiological signatures typically linked with restorative sleep. Objective sleep quantity is within a healthy range (≈7.4 hours median) and shows low variability. Countervailing factors that could elevate PSQI are present but modest: a habitual late sleep onset (~1:26 AM) and high reported evening/leisure engagement (e.g., watching TV/videos 3–4 hours; high socializing), and a slightly higher-than-average nap frequency. Correlations provided in the dataset suggest that several of these factors have only small associations with PSQI in this sample. Taken holistically, the preponderance of evidence (psychological well-being, stable and robust circadian physiology, sufficient and consistent sleep duration) points toward sleep quality that would be at or better than the sample median rather than worse.

Final classification:
Based on the combined survey, behavioral, and wearable data, the participant is most consistent with PSQI scores in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., relatively good or average sleep quality).

49497,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"The self-report measures indicate substantial affective and psychosocial risk factors that are relevant to sleep quality. The participant reports very high depressive symptoms (CES-D = 49, Z = 3.71) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 64, Z = 2.24), alongside low self-esteem (RSES = 22, Z = -2.28) and reduced reported happiness. Stress is modestly elevated relative to the sample (Z ≈ 0.65). These psychological variables show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40 and RSES r ≈ -0.35), indicating that the participant’s marked mood and anxiety profile is a strong contributor to poorer subjective sleep quality in this population. Substance-related behaviors are also notable: routine alcohol use (1–2×/week) and elevated indicators for recreational/non-prescribed drug use (very high Z-scores) suggest lifestyle factors that commonly disturb sleep timing and continuity.

Objective sleep and sleep-timing behavior derived from the wearable show patterns consistent with delayed and irregular sleep. Median sleep start time is late (approximately 01:14), and median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 30 minutes (Z = -0.85), slightly shorter than the cohort average. Variability is pronounced: sleep duration standard deviation is high (148 minutes, Z = 1.06) and sleep-start time standard deviation is especially large (204 minutes, Z = 2.65). Mean daily naps are minimal. Together, these features indicate a pattern of late bedtimes with substantial night-to-night inconsistency in both when sleep begins and how long it lasts—features that are associated in the literature and in these study correlations with worse PSQI scores (sleep variability r ≈ 0.17–0.20).

Circadian and cardiac-derived metrics further support reduced regularity and dampened rhythmicity. Interdaily stability is low (0.21, Z = -1.65) and amplitude is reduced (5.95, Z = -1.56), while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.63, Z = 0.60). These non-parametric and parametric circadian indices indicate a flattened, less-stable 24-hour heart-rate rhythm across the recording period. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show expected nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations ~3–6 AM) but also relatively large positive deviations at around 9–11 AM and an elevated pulse at 10–11 PM (10–11 PM deviation +14.6, Z ≈ 1.3), which is compatible with arousal or evening activity proximal to usual sleep onset. Resting heart rate is within the cohort typical range (~60.6 bpm, Z ≈ 0.3). The combination of low interdaily stability, reduced amplitude, and evening/midnight heart-rate elevation is consistent with a delayed and irregular circadian profile that tends to co-occur with poorer sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality.

Integrating self-report and wearable data, multiple convergent indicators point toward compromised sleep quality for this participant. High depressive and anxious symptom burden—both strongly correlated with worse PSQI—co-occurs with late and highly variable sleep timing, reduced total sleep time relative to the cohort, and circadian measures reflecting reduced regularity and dampened amplitude. Elevated substance and non-prescribed drug use provide additional behavioral risk for sleep disturbance. Although resting heart rate is not markedly elevated and naps are uncommon, the overall pattern (psychological distress + irregular, delayed sleep timing + dampened circadian structure) is a well-established risk constellation for higher PSQI scores.

Taken holistically, the balance of evidence supports that this participant’s PSQI would fall in the higher (worse) half of the study distribution. The strong affective symptom burden, marked sleep-timing irregularity and variability, and circadian dysregulation collectively make it more likely the participant’s PSQI score is in the top 50% (poorer sleep quality) of the sample.

33785,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological symptomatology and self-report patterns: The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 27, Z = 1.42) and elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 56, Z = 1.45). These elevations are among the more prominent standardized deviations in the profile and are positively correlated with worse PSQI scores in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating that, within this cohort, higher mood and anxiety symptom burden is associated with poorer self-reported sleep quality. Self-esteem is below average (RSES = 32, Z = –0.87) and correlates negatively with PSQI (r ≈ –0.35), consistent with the same pattern: lower self-regard tends to accompany worse sleep in this population. Other survey indicators present a mixed picture — self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are modestly above average while perceived stress is relatively low — but the magnitude and direction of the CES-D and STAI elevations suggest a meaningful subjective symptom set that historically predicts increased likelihood of sleep complaints.

Objective sleep timing and duration (wearable and self-report): Wearable-derived sleep duration is in the average-to-favorable range (median 7 h 20 m; Z ≈ 0.18) and naps are rare (mean daily naps ~0.07), indicating adequate opportunity for consolidated nocturnal sleep in terms of total time asleep. The participant’s median sleep onset is late (about 00:39), but sleep-start time is relatively consistent (SD of start times ≈ 49 minutes, Z ≈ –0.75), suggesting a late-evening chronotype with low night-to-night variability in timing. Sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 110 minutes, Z ≈ 0.2) is slightly elevated but not extreme. In sum, objectively recorded sleep quantity and temporal regularity appear sufficient and more characteristic of average or slightly favorable sleep duration, even though the schedule is shifted later than typical.

Circadian and cardiac physiology: Cosinor- and nonparametric-derived circadian metrics indicate a reasonably regular and structured cardiac rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.48; Z ≈ 0.58) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.45; Z ≈ 1.06) are above-average in the sample, and intradaily variability is notably low (0.25; Z ≈ –2.08), consistent with low fragmentation of activity/physiology across the day. Resting heart rate is slightly below population average (58.7 bpm; Z ≈ 0.07) while MESOR and amplitude are modestly elevated, and the acrophase is in the late afternoon (≈4:49 PM). Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected deep nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations around 5–7 AM) but also relatively pronounced evening elevations (notably a marked positive deviation at 10–11 PM). The overall circadian profile reflects a consolidated daily rhythm with a late-active pattern and some evening physiological arousal.

Behavioral context and lifestyle correlates: The participant reports regular solitary exercise (three or more times per week), low substance use, and minimal recreational drug use — behaviors that are generally protective for sleep. Conversely, leisure patterns show high sedentary hobby engagement and above-average video gaming time, and the participant’s schedule is shifted later in the night. These behaviors, combined with elevated depressive and anxious symptoms, could contribute to subjective sleep disturbances or heightened pre-sleep arousal even when objective duration and rhythm are adequate. The participant’s reported low use of alcohol and drugs makes substance-induced sleep disruption an unlikely major contributor.

Integrated interpretation regarding PSQI placement: Objective wearable metrics (adequate median sleep duration, low intradaily variability, reasonable interdaily stability, and low nap frequency) point to average-to-good physiological sleep consolidation and circadian regularity. However, the participant’s elevated depressive symptom burden and trait anxiety — both of which show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this population — increase the likelihood of subjective sleep problems (e.g., worse perceived sleep quality, longer latency, greater disturbances, or daytime dysfunction) that are captured by the PSQI. The late but consistent sleep timing and evening heart-rate elevation provide additional plausibility for subjective difficulties initiating or feeling rested by morning despite objectively adequate sleep time. Given that PSQI is a subjective instrument and that the strongest standardized deviations in this profile are psychological symptoms known to relate to poorer PSQI scores, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the higher (worse) half of the study distribution.

Sleep start time is moderately late (median 00:51) but its night-to-night variability is also lower than average (SD = 55 minutes, Z = -0.61).

Cardiovascular circadian indices point to a well-defined daily trough in heart rate during the early morning with reduced overall rhythm amplitude and modest day-to-day regularity. Cosinor-derived mesor (68.8 bpm, Z = -0.71) and amplitude (7.95 bpm, Z = -0.92) are lower than the cohort mean, indicating an overall lower average heart rate and a dampened circadian range of heart rate variation. The acrophase around 3:51 PM aligns with expected daytime activity peaks. Non-parametric rhythm measures show somewhat reduced interdaily stability (0.35, Z = -0.49) and moderately increased intradaily variability (0.62, Z = +0.53), suggesting somewhat less consistency across days and greater within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology than the average participant. Hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal decreases (~-14 bpm between ~2–7 AM) relative to daytime elevations (peaking ~10–11 AM and mid-afternoon), consistent with a typical nocturnal rest period and daytime activation; these hourly patterns are physiologically coherent with the recorded sleep timing and resting heart rate (58 bpm).

Self-reported psychological and behavioral context does not indicate major affective burden that would strongly predict poor sleep. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 9, Z = -0.45) and perceived stress (score = 19, Z = -0.71) are below the cohort mean, while trait anxiety is near the sample average (STAI = 40, Z = -0.13). Self-esteem is at the upper range of the scale (RSES = 40, Z = +0.26). Lifestyle behaviors include modest alcohol use (wine 1–2 times/week, Z = +0.94), regular but not intensive exercise (1–2 times/week), low recreational drug use, and little evening screen time or sedentary hobbying. These behavioral indicators, together with relatively low reported stress and depressive symptoms, do not strongly signal poor subjective sleep quality.

Weighing multimodal evidence for PSQI placement: indicators supporting relatively good/average sleep include objectively long nightly sleep duration (Z = +0.89), low nightly variability (Z = -1.03), absence of naps, and coherent nocturnal heart rate decline. Countervailing evidence for worse sleep is modest: reduced circadian amplitude and lower interdaily stability (Zs roughly -0.5 to -0.9) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (Z = +0.53), which can associate with less robust rhythm structure and, in other samples, with worse PSQI. However, the effect sizes of those circadian deviations are small-to-moderate and subjective measures of mood/stress do not indicate major contributors to poor sleep. Correlations provided between these wearable circadian metrics and PSQI are small in magnitude. On balance, the preponderance of objective sleep quantity/consistency and the benign self-report profile favor placement in the lower half of the study PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality rather than poor sleep).

The participant’s objective sleep metrics indicate substantially restricted and irregular nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration was 5 hours 27 minutes (Z = -2.16 relative to the study sample), which is markedly below the cohort mean and would typically contribute to poorer subjective sleep quality. Sleep timing is highly delayed on average: the median sleep start time is 04:42 AM, and the night-to-night variability in sleep start is extremely large (SD = 422 minutes, Z = 7.44). Likewise, sleep duration variability is unusually high (SD = 359 minutes, Z = 5.88). Although mean daily naps are infrequent (0.18 naps/day, Z = 1.27), the dominant picture is one of chronic short sleep with pronounced irregularity in both onset and duration. These objective features—very short median sleep and extreme temporal variability—are strong markers of fragmented sleep schedules and are commonly associated with worse PSQI scores.

Circadian and heart-rate–derived rhythm features
Heart-rate circadian metrics indicate weakened rhythmicity and reduced amplitude. Interdaily stability is low (0.22, Z = -1.56) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is low (0.11, Z = -1.79), showing limited day-to-day consistency in the participant’s circadian pattern of heart rate. Parametric cosinor features show a relatively low MESOR (66.6, Z = -1.0) and reduced amplitude (6.21, Z = -1.48), with an acrophase around 5:09 PM. Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor reveal the expected large nocturnal heart-rate drop (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and daytime elevations around late morning and early afternoon; several nocturnal hours (e.g., 2–5 AM) show moderate positive correlations with PSQI, suggesting that the degree of nocturnal heart-rate reduction is related to subjective sleep disturbance in the sample. Altogether, the circadian and HR data reflect a low-amplitude, inconsistent rhythm consistent with irregular sleep–wake timing and potential circadian misalignment.

Psychological traits and lifestyle correlates relevant to sleep
Self-report trait measures present a mixed picture. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55, classified “not depressed”), while trait anxiety is modestly elevated (STAI = 42, Z ≈ 0.07). Self-esteem is high (Rosenberg = 40), and reported health satisfaction is near average. The participant reports low substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs) and minimal engagement in sports or exercise (exercise frequency ~1–2 times/month). Socializing time is low and self-reported current happiness is slightly below sample average (score = 3.0, Z = -0.53). Correlations in the dataset indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms are positively associated with PSQI in this cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), so even modest elevations in anxiety can contribute to worse subjective sleep. Protective features for sleep quality include the absence of substance use and relatively good academic performance; however, low physical activity and reduced social/habitual structure likely exacerbate circadian irregularity.

Integration and likely impact on PSQI
Weighing the multimodal evidence, the strongest and most salient indicators point toward poor overall sleep quality. The participant exhibits objectively short total sleep time (median ≈ 5.5 hours), extreme night-to-night variability in both timing and duration, and weakened circadian stability and amplitude—each of which has robust relationships with poorer PSQI scores in the literature and within the study correlations (notably variability measures correlate positively with PSQI). Psychological variables do not show major depressive symptom burden but do show modest anxiety and lower reported happiness, which are also associated with worse sleep in the cohort. Offsetting factors (no substance use, low resting heart rate, high self-esteem, good GPA) are unlikely to fully counterbalance the objective sleep restriction and severe irregularity. On balance, the pattern of physiological and behavioral data is most consistent with a PSQI score in the worse half of the study distribution.

79395,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report instruments indicate a marked affective burden during the recording period. The CES-D score is 32 (Z = 1.95; classified as depressed), and trait anxiety (STAI) is elevated at 54 (Z = 1.25). Self-esteem and momentary well-being are low (Rosenberg self‑esteem score = 25, Z = -1.85; happiness current = 2.0, Z = -1.61). These scales show moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40; self-esteem r ≈ -0.36), indicating that the participant’s high symptom burden is the single strongest psychosocial signal that typically co‑occurs with poorer subjective sleep quality. Lifestyle behaviors (moderate weekly alcohol use, limited recreational drug use, regular social exercise) do not indicate heavy substance or sedentary extremes, but do reflect routine evening social/activity engagement that could interact with sleep timing.

Sleep timing and duration (wearable and self-report): Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a median sleep duration of 7 h 15 min (Z ≈ 0.09), with relatively low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 88 minutes, Z = -0.29). Nights begin late and consistently: median sleep start time is 01:21:45 with a relatively small start‑time SD (47 minutes, Z = -0.80). Daytime napping is minimal (mean daily naps ≈ 0.08). Objectively, total sleep time is close to sample average and night-to-night regularity is reasonably good; however the habitual sleep onset is late (post‑1:00 AM), which suggests a persistent late timing of the sleep episode even if total duration is preserved.

Circadian and physiological patterns: Heart‑rate–based circadian features are consistent and structured. Interdaily stability is high (0.55, Z = 1.16) and autocorrelation at 24 h is elevated (0.46, Z = 1.15), while intradaily variability is modestly low (0.47, Z = -0.53), all indicating a regular daily heart‑rate rhythm with limited fragmentation. Mesor and resting heart rate are slightly below sample mean (mesor ≈ 72.3 bpm, RHR ≈ 56.7 bpm). Hourly deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations ~3–6 AM) and clear daytime/evening rises. Notably, there are pronounced positive deviations in the late evening (9–11 PM: +14.4 to +14.43), suggesting elevated physiological activation or arousal in the hours before the participant’s typical sleep onset. This pattern is consistent with physiological arousal late in the evening despite an otherwise regular circadian structure.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI): The objective wearable data present a mixed picture: sleep duration and regularity are near-sample average or somewhat protective, and circadian stability is relatively high, features that tend to associate with better objective sleep continuity. In contrast, strong affective symptomatology (high depressive symptoms, elevated trait anxiety, low self‑esteem and happiness) are robust predictors of worse subjective sleep in this sample (CES-D and STAI both positively correlated with PSQI). The elevated late‑evening heart rate suggests pre‑sleep physiological arousal that may impair sleep initiation or subjective sleep quality even when total time asleep is adequate. Given the prominence and known strength of the associations between depressive/anxiety symptom burden and higher PSQI, along with physiologic evidence of evening arousal and late sleep timing, the preponderance of evidence supports higher subjective sleep disturbance for this participant.

59863,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report measures indicate a broadly favorable psychological profile for sleep. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86, classified as not depressed) and trait anxiety is low (STAI = 24, Z = -1.71). Self-esteem and momentary well-being are relatively high (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = 1.66; current happiness Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction is above average (Z = 1.3). Stress is slightly below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.44). These self-report features are generally associated with better subjective sleep quality in this dataset (noting the CES-D and STAI have positive correlations with PSQI), and here they point away from substantial mood- or anxiety-related contributors to poor sleep.

Behavioral and sleep habit indicators:
Wearable-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 7 hours 24 minutes (Z = 0.27), a typical sleep onset near 00:38 (median start time = 00:38:30), low variability in nightly duration (SD ≈ 70 minutes, Z = -0.69), and low propensity to nap (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). These patterns indicate adequate total sleep time relative to the study population and relatively consistent sleep across nights. The moderate timing (sleep onset around midnight) and the limited night-to-night variability are features typically associated with better sleep regularity and, in turn, more favorable PSQI domain scores.

Circadian rhythm and physiological profile:
Heart-rate–derived circadian measures indicate a fairly regular 24-hour pattern: interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.46, Z = 0.42) and intradaily variability is notably low (0.38, Z = -1.16), which together suggest consistent day-to-day structure and limited within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is modestly above average (Z = 0.64). The mesor (mean circadian heart rate) is elevated relative to the sample (91.26, Z = 2.36) and the resting heart rate is also moderately above average (67.65, Z = 1.13). Hourly deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal dip (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM) and diurnal elevations in the afternoon/evening. Although the elevated mesor and resting HR could reflect higher baseline cardiovascular activation, their correlations with PSQI in this dataset are small; the more salient circadian indicators for sleep quality—low intradaily variability and reasonable interdaily stability—are aligned with better sleep regularity.

Synthesis and likely PSQI placement:
Across modalities, the participant demonstrates several features that favor lower (better) PSQI scores: adequate median sleep duration (~7.4 hours), low night-to-night variability, negligible napping, low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, regular circadian structure, and frequent exercise. Small elevations in resting HR and mesor represent a potential physiological signal that, in isolation, might modestly associate with worse sleep, but these effects are minor in magnitude and are not accompanied by behavioral or mood indicators of poor sleep. Aggregating the objective sleep statistics, circadian regularity, and positive psychological profile yields stronger evidence for relatively good or average sleep quality than for poor sleep. Therefore the preponderance of available data suggests the participant’s overall PSQI score is more consistent with the lower half of the study distribution (relatively better/average sleep).

22913,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"The self-report profile indicates generally favorable psychological functioning and modest health behaviors. The participant reports no depressive symptoms on the CES-D (score = 0) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 34), with self-esteem near the sample mean; these measures are the strongest psychometric correlates of sleep quality in the dataset and here point away from symptom-related sleep disruption. Reported stress and health satisfaction are near average-to-better-than-average for the sample. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and spirits 1–2×/week), exercise and organized sport participation are infrequent, and BMI is in the overweight range (28.7). Overall, the survey profile suggests low affective burden and limited alcohol/drug exposure, but relatively low physical activity and elevated BMI, which could modestly influence sleep physiology while not implying marked subjective sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a relatively regular and well-structured daily rhythm. Non-parametric circadian measures show average interdaily stability (0.41) and notably low intradaily variability (0.29, Z = -1.8), indicating consistent day–night organization and few within-day fragmentation episodes. Cosinor results show a higher-than-sample-average MESOR (mean heart rate ~87 bpm, Z = 1.81) and a moderate amplitude (Z = 0.84), with acrophase in the late afternoon (~4:49 PM). Resting heart rate (~64.6 bpm, Z = 0.77) is modestly above population mean but within a common physiological range for young adults. Hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations between ~1–7 AM) and daytime elevations concentrated midday–afternoon. Taken together, these wearable signals are consistent with a consolidated nocturnal rest period and a robust daytime arousal profile; the slightly elevated mesor may reflect higher daytime cardiovascular tone (possible contribution from BMI or low activity) rather than fragmented sleep.

Objective sleep timing and quantity are notable for extended and regular sleep opportunity. Median nightly sleep duration is long relative to the sample (8 h 37 min; Z = 1.79), naps are rare (mean 0.12/day), and night-to-night variability in duration and start time are moderate (SD duration ≈ 92 min; SD start time ≈ 83 min). Median sleep start near 23:55 indicates a roughly conventional sleep onset time for students, and the large negative hourly heart-rate deviations during the early morning hours corroborate sustained nocturnal rest. There is no wearable-derived evidence of frequent nocturnal arousals or erratic sleep timing; intradaily variability and autocorrelation metrics further support consolidated nighttime sleep and stable day–night patterns.

Integrating subjective and objective data with the PSQI-relevant correlations favors classification into the lower half of the study’s PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good or average sleep quality). The strongest risk correlates for poor PSQI in this dataset—depressive symptoms and trait anxiety—are absent here. Objective metrics indicate sufficient sleep duration, low within-day fragmentation, regular timing, and limited napping, all of which are typically associated with better PSQI scores. While the elevated MESOR and higher BMI suggest some physiological load that could modestly affect sleep quality, the overall pattern of long, regular nocturnal sleep and low self-reported affective disturbance argues against a high PSQI score. On balance, the evidence supports that this participant would fall in the bottom 50% of the study PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively low/average PSQI).

48969,13.0,0.9764397905759162,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The self-report instruments indicate a notably elevated affective symptom burden. The CES-D score (42; Z = 2.99) and the STAI–Trait score (59; Z = 1.75) place the participant well above the sample mean for depressive and trait-anxious symptoms, respectively, and the Rosenberg Self‑Esteem score (22; Z = -2.28) is markedly lower than the population average. Together these scores describe a pattern of high negative affectivity and low self-regard. Behavioral reports show extensive solitary, screen-based leisure (television/video, video games, internet, music each reported at >4 hours per day; several Z-scores >> 2) and limited in-person socializing (≈15 minutes; Z = -2.2). Exercise is reported frequently but primarily performed alone. Substance and non-prescribed drug use are minimal. This combination—elevated internalizing symptoms, high evening/solitary screen time, and low social engagement—constitutes a behavioral context that is commonly associated with subjective sleep complaints and daytime impairment.

Wearable-derived circadian and autonomic metrics:
Heart-rate–based circadian measures indicate a present but moderately blunted and somewhat shifted rhythm. The cosinor mesor (79.8 bpm; Z = 0.79) and resting heart rate (≈68.6 bpm; Z = 1.24) are above the population mean, consistent with higher baseline cardiovascular arousal. Amplitude is below average (9.6; Z = -0.38), suggesting reduced peak-to-trough variation in heart rate across the day. Nonparametric rhythm metrics show average regularity (interdaily stability ≈0.40; Z ≈ -0.08) and slightly lower intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability ≈0.5; Z ≈ -0.32), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is relatively high (0.44; Z = 0.98), indicating a consistent daily pattern across the recording period. Hourly deviation values show expected nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations pre-dawn) and daytime elevations peaking in the late afternoon/early evening (acrophase ≈ 5:06 PM). Overall, physiology is compatible with a typical diurnal profile but with elevated resting arousal and somewhat attenuated amplitude, a pattern that can co-occur with chronic stress or affective symptoms.

Sleep timing and duration behavior:
Objectively recorded sleep duration is in the favorable range for young adults: median nightly sleep was about 7 hours 51 minutes (Z = 0.84), with no detected naps on average (Z = -0.86). Median sleep onset is shortly after midnight (~00:06), with night-to-night variability in both duration (SD ≈ 116 minutes; Z = 0.33) and sleep start time (SD ≈ 83 minutes; Z ≈ -0.01) that are modestly elevated. These wearable-derived sleep metrics suggest that the participant achieves near-recommended total sleep time on many nights but with some inconsistency in timing and moderate variability across nights. Correlations supplied in the dataset indicate that sleep duration itself has minimal direct correlation with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.04), whereas variability in sleep duration and timing show somewhat stronger positive correlations with poorer PSQI scores (e.g., sleep duration SD r ≈ 0.20).

Integrated interpretation relative to sleep quality (PSQI):
Although objective sleep quantity is generally adequate, multiple converging signals point toward poorer subjective sleep quality. High depressive and trait‑anxiety scores—which correlate positively with PSQI in this sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.48; STAI r ≈ 0.39)—are strong predictors of reported sleep problems and daytime dysfunction independent of objective sleep duration. Elevated resting heart rate and a reduced circadian amplitude further suggest chronic physiological arousal, which is associated with disturbed sleep continuity and sleep quality. Behavioral factors that reduce sleep quality risk (extensive evening screen exposure, irregular sleep timing and moderate night-to-night variability, low social engagement) further increase the likelihood of subjective sleep complaints. Wearable data do not contradict these signals but instead show adequate total sleep time with some irregularity; however, subjective measures and physiologic arousal indicators have larger, clinically meaningful associations with PSQI in this dataset.

Conclusion — PSQI group:
Weighing the objective sleep quantity against the substantial affective symptom burden, elevated resting arousal, high evening screen use, and modest sleep timing irregularity—and considering the moderate-to-strong correlations between affective symptoms and PSQI in the sample—the participant is more likely to report relatively poorer overall sleep quality. Therefore their PSQI score is most consistent with the upper half of the study distribution.

The CES-D score of 27 (Z = 1.42) and STAI–Trait of 60 (Z = 1.85) place this participant well above the sample mean for depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms; both of those scales have moderate-to-strong positive correlations with PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40), suggesting these symptoms are likely to co-occur with poorer subjective sleep quality. Rosenberg self-esteem is relatively low (score 29, Z = −1.29; r with PSQI ≈ −0.35), and health satisfaction is below the sample average (Z ≈ −1.53). Lifestyle reports show minimal regular exercise (exercise Z-scores between −1.58 and −1.93), infrequent alcohol use, and higher-than-average sedentary/entertainment engagement (e.g., listening to music Z = 1.60, internet use Z = 0.85). Together, these self-report features indicate elevated affective burden and lifestyle patterns that commonly relate to disrupted sleep.

Sleep timing, duration, and regularity: Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a long median sleep duration (8 h 17 m; Z = 1.37) but large night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 177 minutes; Z = 1.73) and a very late median sleep onset (~02:58 AM). The combination of long average sleep with high intra-individual variability and a consistently late sleep midpoint is characteristic of an irregular, delayed sleep schedule rather than stable restorative sleep. Sleep start-time variability is not elevated (SD of start time Z = −0.66), implying late bedtimes are typical rather than sporadic—but the very late habitual onset is itself associated with poorer sleep quality and daytime functioning in student samples. The participant also takes occasional naps (mean daily naps 0.19, Z = 1.34), which can both reflect and contribute to consolidation/continuity issues overnight.

Circadian rhythm and autonomic indicators: Heart-rate–based circadian features indicate blunted circadian amplitude (amplitude Z ≈ −1.19) and below-average interdaily stability (value 0.34, Z ≈ −0.57), with modestly elevated intradaily variability (0.64, Z ≈ 0.67). The MESOR is higher than average (79.9, Z ≈ 0.81) and resting heart rate is elevated (71.2 bpm, Z ≈ 1.55). These patterns—reduced amplitude, lower day-to-day regularity, greater within-day fragmentation, and higher baseline cardiac activity—are consistent with circadian and autonomic dysregulation that often accompanies poor or fragmented sleep. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show expected nocturnal declines but relatively elevated evening activity (acrophase ~6:27 PM; relatively blunted amplitude), which aligns with a delayed-evening physiology and diminished circadian robustness.

Integrated interpretation relative to PSQI: Although average nightly duration is long, multiple converging signals point toward poorer overall sleep quality. Elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, high variability in sleep duration, delayed habitual sleep timing, reduced circadian amplitude and stability, increased intradaily variability, and higher resting heart rate are all features that in this dataset correlate (directly or conceptually) with higher/worse PSQI scores. Some metrics (e.g., median sleep duration) by themselves might suggest adequate time in bed, but the combination of timing, irregularity, affective symptoms, and circadian/physiological dysregulation argues against classifying this participant as having good or average sleep quality.

Overall PSQI group assignment: Considering the weight of evidence from self-report symptomatology, sleep timing and variability, circadian rhythm metrics, and autonomic indicators, this participant is more consistent with the higher (worse) half of the PSQI distribution.

CES-D score (3.0; Z = -1.07) and STAI–Trait (35.0; Z = -0.62) are both well below the study mean, indicating minimal recent depressive symptoms and below-average trait anxiety. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are above average (SelfEsteem Z = 0.96; Happy Z = 1.64), and self-reported stress is below average (Stress Z = -0.98). Substance use is essentially absent, and health-related satisfaction is somewhat lower than average (Z = -0.78) but not extreme. Taken together, these survey indicators point to a generally resilient psychological profile with limited internalizing symptom burden—factors that typically support better subjective sleep quality.

Behavioral lifestyle profile:
Daily activities and lifestyle behaviors appear health-conducive. The participant reports very low recreational screen and internet time, no regular solitary exercise but some group exercise (1–2 times/week), no naps, and minimal alcohol or drug use. Sedentary hobby time is modestly elevated (Z = 0.82) but other recreation metrics (TV, gaming, music, socializing) are low. These behavioral patterns imply relatively low evening stimulation from screens/substances and few daytime naps, both of which tend to support consolidated nocturnal sleep. The late median sleep start time (about 01:07) suggests a delayed sleep schedule, but low variability in start time (SD ~50 minutes; Z = -0.72) and in duration (SD 42 minutes; Z = -1.33) indicate a consistent sleep routine despite the late clock hour.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a strong, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.58; Z = 1.41) and 24-hour autocorrelation is high (0.48; Z = 1.32), indicating consistent day-to-day timing of the circadian signal. Amplitude of the cosinor fit is strongly elevated (19.12; Z = 2.70), while MESOR is slightly above the population mean (76.46; Z = 0.34). The acrophase (~4:23 PM) is within a typical waking-day afternoon peak. Resting heart rate is low (49.8 bpm; Z = -0.99), consistent with higher fitness or parasympathetic tone. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal dips (largest negative deviations between ~1–6 AM, reaching ~-34 bpm around 4–5 AM; Zs down to -2.68) and clear daytime increases, which together reflect robust nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation. Overall, the wearable data indicate a well-entrained circadian profile with strong amplitude and clear nocturnal recovery physiology—objective features generally associated with restorative sleep.

Sleep timing and duration:
Fitbit-derived sleep duration is slightly below the study mean but close to typical college ranges: median nightly sleep ~6 hours 52 minutes (Z = -0.40). The participant shows low night-to-night variability in duration (SD 42 minutes; Z = -1.33) and virtually no naps (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). Median sleep onset at ~01:07 suggests a late chronotype or habitual delayed sleep timing. Despite shorter-than-ideal objective duration by a small margin, the combination of consistent timing, low variability, absence of daytime napping, and strong nocturnal heart-rate dipping suggests sleep episodes are relatively consolidated and physiologically restorative.

Synthesis and implications for PSQI ranking:
Evidence supporting relatively good sleep quality: low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-reported happiness and self-esteem, minimal substance use, consistent sleep timing and low variability, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dipping, strong circadian amplitude, high interdaily stability, and absence of naps. Evidence suggesting risk for poorer sleep: a habitual late sleep onset (~1:07 AM) and a median sleep duration modestly below the population mean (~6 h 52 m), which could contribute to subjective complaints about sleep latency or insufficient duration in some contexts. Overall, the preponderance of psychological, behavioral, and physiological indicators favors relatively good/average sleep quality rather than clinically poor sleep. Given the combination of low symptom burden, strong circadian regularity and amplitude, consistent sleep patterns, and objectively restorative nocturnal physiology, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the study distribution for PSQI score (i.e., better sleep quality).

Depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 11) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38) are below the cohort mean (Z-scores slightly negative), and self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average; these characteristics are typically associated with better subjective sleep quality in this sample (notably CES-D and STAI show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the cohort). Reported stress is modestly elevated (Z ≈ 0.65) but correlations between stress and PSQI are small in the study. Alcohol use is present at a moderate level (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.0) while recreational drug use and napping are absent. The participant reports little solitary exercise but some group exercise (1–2×/week). Overall, the psychosocial profile contains several protective signals for sleep (low depressive/anxiety symptoms, high health satisfaction/self-esteem) with some countervailing lifestyle features (moderate alcohol, low alone exercise).

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular profile: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show relatively strong day-to-day regularity and a robust amplitude. Interdaily stability is elevated (Value = 0.55, Z ≈ 1.16) and amplitude is above average (Z ≈ 0.91), indicating a consistent, well-structured 24-hour rhythm in cardiovascular activity. Intradaily variability is slightly above average but not extreme. The participant’s resting heart rate is low (47 bpm, Z ≈ -1.33), which together with a clear nocturnal nadir (large negative deviations from the mesor between ~1–6 AM) suggests consolidated physiologic quiescence overnight. The acrophase in the late afternoon (≈4:14 PM) and mid-morning to afternoon positive heart-rate deviations indicate a typical daytime activity profile. Taken together, the wearable circadian signals point to a consistent and physiologically robust rhythm, with relatively low within-day fragmentation and a strong nocturnal reduction in cardiovascular activity.

Objective sleep behavior and timing: Nightly sleep metrics reveal a short habitual sleep duration and late sleep timing. Median sleep duration is approximately 5 hours 44 minutes (Z ≈ -1.81), substantially shorter than the study population median, and median sleep start time is around 01:11 AM. Night-to-night variability in both duration and sleep start is relatively low (sleep duration SD ≈ 64 minutes, sleep start SD ≈ 32 minutes, Z-scores below average), and naps are absent. The objective profile therefore shows consistent but curtailed sleep episodes that begin late and are reliably reproduced across nights. The strong nocturnal heart-rate trough suggests these short episodes are physiologically consolidated but nonetheless brief.

Integrated interpretation relative to sleep quality: The participant presents a mixed pattern for PSQI-relevant domains. Protective indicators—low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem and health satisfaction, strong interdaily stability and amplitude of circadian rhythm, low resting heart rate, and low night-to-night variability—tend to predict better subjective sleep quality. Contrastingly, the objectively short median sleep duration (near two standard deviations shorter than the cohort average) and late sleep timing are established contributors to poorer subjective and functional sleep outcomes and are likely to increase PSQI scores in the domains of sleep duration, sleep latency/efficiency, and daytime dysfunction. In this dataset many psychosocial measures correlate with PSQI more strongly than some objective heart-rate features, but the magnitude of the participant’s short sleep duration is a salient outlier relative to peers and is likely to have a material negative impact on overall PSQI.

PSQI group judgment: Balancing the evidence, the most influential factor for overall sleep quality here is the markedly short habitual sleep duration combined with late bedtimes, despite a pattern of stable circadian rhythm and generally favorable affective functioning. Because short objective sleep duration is strongly consequential for several PSQI domains (duration and daytime functioning) and this participant’s duration is far below the cohort median, the overall profile is more consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality within the study population. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep quality).

77036,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral context: The participant reports low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 8, Z = -0.55) and near-average self-esteem (RSES = 38, Z ≈ -0.03), with modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17) and slightly above-average perceived stress (Score = 23, Z = 0.38). Health satisfaction is a bit lower than the sample mean (Z = -0.53). Substance use is minimal (alcohol and recreational drugs reported as none or rare), and recreational/screen activities are low relative to peers. Physical activity is mixed: informal exercise frequency is low (exercising alone/with others rare), but the participant reports engaging in sports 1–2 times per week (Z = 0.91). Taken together, the psychological profile signals relatively low depressive burden but mild anxiety/stress that could modestly influence sleep; lifestyle factors (low substance use, limited evening screen time, and some weekly sports) are generally supportive of sleep.

Wearable-derived sleep behavior: Nightly sleep recorded by the wearable centers on a median duration of 6 hours 51 minutes (Z = -0.41), indicating slightly shorter sleep than the study mean but not markedly so. Sleep timing is relatively consistent with a median sleep onset near 00:47 (sleep start SD = 58 minutes, Z = -0.55) and low day-to-day variability in duration (duration SD = 67 minutes, Z = -0.77). The participant reports essentially no daily napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). These features—near-seven-hour nightly sleep, limited variability in both timing and duration, and absence of naps—contribute to a stable sleep pattern that is typically associated with more consolidated sleep opportunity and fewer circadian misalignments.

Circadian and physiological signals: Heart-rate circadian metrics show robust, regular patterns. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.53, Z = 1.0) and intradaily variability is low (0.36, Z = -1.31), while autocorrelation at 24 hours is markedly high (0.62, Z = 2.49). These parametric and non-parametric indicators collectively indicate a strong, consistent 24-hour structure in cardiovascular activity across the recording period. The resting heart rate (61.2 bpm, Z = 0.36) and mesor (78.49 bpm, Z = 0.62) are near but slightly above the sample mean, and the expected nocturnal reductions in hourly mean heart rate (largest deviations ~ -20 bpm between ~3:00–5:00 AM) are pronounced, consistent with physiologic quiescence overnight. Overall, the wearable physiology suggests intact circadian organization and clear nocturnal downregulation of autonomic arousal—features that favor sleep continuity and quality.

Integration and implications for PSQI: Several objective and self-report indicators point toward generally favourable sleep quality. The participant’s sleep timing and duration are consistent from night to night, naps are absent, circadian stability is high, and wearable-derived nocturnal heart-rate declines are pronounced—each of these is associated with better sleep consolidation and lower likelihood of sleep fragmentation. Countervailing signals are modest: median sleep duration is slightly under 7 hours (a small risk factor for worse sleep-related complaints), and trait anxiety/stress are mildly elevated, both of which are correlated in the sample with higher PSQI in prior analyses. However, the magnitude of the protective circadian and behavioral factors (notably strong interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, and very high 24-hour autocorrelation) together with low depressive symptom burden and low substance use outweigh the modest risk signals. On balance, the evidence indicates the participant is more likely to have a PSQI in the lower (better) half of the study distribution.

82986,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Summary of self-report psychological and behavioral characteristics:
The participant reports low affective symptom burden and generally positive well-being: CES-D = 4 (Z = -0.97), STAI-Trait = 25 (Z = -1.61), self-esteem and happiness both relatively high (self-esteem Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64). Stress and health-satisfaction scores are slightly favorable relative to the sample (stress Z = -0.71; health-satisfaction Z = 0.8). Substance use is absent, and recreational screen/time use is low; exercise is limited (exercised alone 1–2 times per week). These self-report features point to low internalizing symptoms and generally adaptive psychosocial functioning during the recording period.

Wearable-derived sleep behavior and timing:
Objective sleep behavior from the Fitbit shows substantially shortened nocturnal sleep and late sleep timing. Median sleep duration is 5 hours 6 minutes (Z = -2.6), with a median sleep start time of approximately 02:24. Night-to-night variability in duration is moderate (SD ≈ 68 minutes, Z = -0.75) and sleep start time variability is about 61 minutes (Z = -0.48). Mean daily naps are effectively zero. The combination of very short nightly sleep and a consistently late sleep onset is a salient behavioral pattern likely to reduce total sleep opportunity and to constrain nocturnal restorative processes.

Circadian and physiological patterns:
Heart-rate–derived circadian summaries indicate a relatively blunted and less-stable rhythm. Parametric and non-parametric features show a lower-than-average amplitude (amplitude = 7.55, Z = -1.04) and reduced interdaily stability (0.33, Z = -0.66), while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.61, Z = 0.46). Resting heart rate and mesor are somewhat higher than the sample mean (RHR = 66.8 bpm, Z = 1.03; mesor = 79.73, Z = 0.79). Hourly aggregate deviations from mesor show the expected nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations around 3–4 AM, down to about -18 bpm) and notable elevations in the evening/night window (e.g., +10.96 bpm at 10–11 PM and +10.9 at 6–7 PM). Together, these features are consistent with a circadian profile that has reduced peak-trough contrast and weaker day-to-day regularity, with comparatively elevated evening physiological activation and a preserved nocturnal heart-rate decline.

Integrated interpretation relevant to sleep quality (PSQI domains):
There is a clear mismatch between the participant’s favorable self-reported psychological state and the objective sleep/circadian markers. The objective signal most strongly predictive of poor PSQI-related domains is the very short median sleep duration (≈5 h), which is well below the cohort mean (Z = -2.6) and would directly increase PSQI component scores for sleep duration and likely overall global PSQI. The late median sleep onset (≈02:24) and modest day-to-day timing variability further point toward circadian misalignment that commonly contributes to poorer perceived and objective sleep quality (sleep latency, efficiency, and daytime dysfunction). Circadian metrics (reduced amplitude and interdaily stability, higher intradaily variability) and elevated resting/ evening heart-rate values indicate physiological irregularity and relative evening arousal that would also be expected to worsen sleep continuity and restorative consolidation. Although the participant reports low depressive and anxiety symptoms—which, if reflected in subjective PSQI responses, could mitigate self-rated sleep complaints—the objective wearable signals (short sleep opportunity, late timing, circadian blunting) provide convergent evidence for reduced sleep quality across PSQI domains.

Evidence weighing toward lower vs. higher PSQI:
- Evidence consistent with poorer (higher) PSQI: very short objective sleep duration (median 5h6m, Z = -2.6); late sleep onset (~02:24); reduced circadian amplitude and stability (amplitude Z = -1.04; interdaily stability Z = -0.66); elevated resting HR and evening HR peaks suggesting physiological arousal near habitual bedtime.
- Evidence consistent with better (lower) PSQI: low depressive/anxiety symptoms and relatively high self-reported happiness and self-esteem, low substance use, and no daytime napping.

Holistic conclusion:
On balance, the objective wearable evidence for markedly curtailed nightly sleep opportunity, late sleep timing, and blunted/irregular circadian structure is likely to drive higher (worse) PSQI scores despite generally favorable mood and low reported stress. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution for PSQI (worse sleep quality).

11402,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant reports elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 54, Z = 1.25) and a moderate level of depressive symptoms on the CES-D (score = 17, Z = 0.38), both of which are positively correlated with poorer PSQI scores in the study sample (STAI r ≈ 0.4; CES-D r ≈ 0.5). Self-esteem is relatively high (Rosenberg = 40), which is associated with better sleep in the cohort (r ≈ -0.35), but other self-reported well-being markers are muted: happiness is below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.53) and health satisfaction is slightly lower than average (Z ≈ -0.53). The participant’s lifestyle habits include modest alcohol use (beer 1–2×/week), minimal recreational drug use, limited formal sport participation, and notable sedentary leisure (video games 1–2 hours/day, Z = 2.47; TV/video 1–2 hours/day, Z = 1.28). These behavioral features (high evening screen-based recreation, limited exercise) align with factors that tend to relate to worse sleep in this population.

Sleep behavior and timing from wearables: Wearable-derived sleep timing is atypically delayed and variable. Median sleep start time is very late (≈03:18), with a large night-to-night start-time standard deviation (~135 minutes, Z ≈ 1.14), and median nightly sleep duration is relatively short (6 h 19 min, Z ≈ -1.07). Sleep duration shows substantial variability across nights (SD ≈ 136 minutes, Z ≈ 0.8). Mean daily naps are modest but higher than average (0.18 naps/day, Z ≈ 1.21). Together, these features indicate a pattern of late, inconsistent sleep timing and shorter-than-average nocturnal sleep, characteristics that are typically associated with worse subjective sleep quality.

Circadian and cardiac physiology: Cosinor and non-parametric circadian metrics show reduced day-to-day regularity of heart rate (interdaily stability ≈ 0.37, Z ≈ -0.33; autocorrelation at 24h Z ≈ -1.03) and unusually low intradaily variability (Z ≈ -1.45). The mesor (mean heart rate) is elevated relative to the sample (≈83.5 bpm, Z ≈ 1.3) and resting heart rate is somewhat above average (63.4 bpm, Z ≈ 0.62). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor reveal relatively elevated cardiac activity around late-night hours (12–2 AM positive deviations) and pronounced negative deviations through the early morning (largest negative around 6–7 AM). The elevated late-night heart rate together with an evening acrophase (~6:58 PM) and late sleep start time suggest physiologic arousal in the late evening / early night period consistent with delayed sleep timing and potential pre-sleep activation.

Integration and implication for sleep quality: Multiple convergent indicators point toward relatively poor sleep quality in this participant. Late median sleep onset (~3:18 AM), short median sleep duration (~6 h 19 m) and high night-to-night variability are behavioral patterns strongly associated with worse PSQI scores. These objective timing features are reinforced by psychological risk factors (notably elevated trait anxiety and increased depressive symptoms) that correlate with higher PSQI in the cohort. Physiological data (elevated mesor and late-night heart rate elevations) are consistent with increased evening arousal. Although there are some mitigating features (high self-esteem, low recreational drug use), the balance of evidence—particularly the late/variable sleep schedule together with anxiety/depressive symptoms and elevated average cardiac tone—aligns with the top half of the sample on PSQI (i.e., relatively poorer sleep).

38610,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report data indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and generally positive psychosocial functioning. The participant’s CES-D (score = 3, Z = -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31) are both well below the sample mean, and self-esteem and momentary happiness ratings are notably above average (RSES Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64). Health satisfaction is also above average (Z = 1.13). Substance use is minimal and exercise, particularly exercising with others, is frequent (exercise-with-others Z = 1.23). Taken together, these self-report indicators suggest low depressive and anxious symptomatology, high self-regard and life satisfaction, and engagement in health-promoting behaviors that would typically support sleep health.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular signals: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a relatively high mesor and resting heart rate (mesor = 82.33, Z = 1.14; resting HR = 67.7, Z = 1.14), which indicates the participant’s overall mean cardiovascular level is elevated relative to peers. Amplitude is reduced (amplitude = 7.23, Z = -1.15), and interdaily stability is modestly below average (0.37, Z = -0.33), while intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.59, Z = 0.32). This pattern (higher overall HR setpoint, lower circadian amplitude, and mildly greater fragmentation within days) points to a blunted and somewhat less stable circadian organization of heart-rate rhythms across the recording period. The acrophase around 5:32 PM is within a typical waking-evening window; however, the combination of dampened amplitude and increased intraday fragmentation can be associated with less robust physiological distinction between sleep and wake.

Objective sleep timing and duration: Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a late and relatively constrained sleep period. Median sleep start time is very late (02:39 AM) and median nightly sleep duration is short (5 hours 46 minutes; Z = -1.76), substantially below the study mean and typical recommendations. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and sleep-onset timing are not especially large (duration SD ≈ 90 minutes, Z = -0.25; start-time SD ≈ 54 minutes, Z = -0.63), indicating the participant tends to go to bed late but at a somewhat consistent late hour rather than highly irregular timing. Daytime napping is rare. Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir in the early morning (large negative deviations from the mesor between ~2–7 AM), which is consistent with consolidated sleep during those hours, but because the participant’s sleep onset is late, the cardiovascular nadir is shifted relative to typical earlier-sleeping schedules.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI): There is a clear divergence between favorable psychosocial indicators and objective sleep behavior. The participant’s strong psychosocial profile (low depression/anxiety, high self-esteem, low substance use, social exercise) would typically support better subjective sleep quality. However, objective wearable metrics point to sleep timing and duration patterns that often degrade sleep quality: a consistently late sleep onset (~02:39 AM) combined with a short median sleep duration (~5h46m, Z = -1.76) constitutes the most salient risk for poorer PSQI scores. Physiological data (reduced circadian amplitude, modestly elevated intradaily variability, and a relatively elevated resting HR and mesor) are consistent with a blunted circadian signal and slight physiological activation that can accompany or exacerbate sleep complaints. Correlations supplied in the dataset between some circadian/heart-rate features and PSQI are small to modest, but the magnitude of the short sleep duration and late timing (both established contributors to poor sleep quality) outweigh the countervailing evidence from positive mental-health ratings.

Conclusion regarding PSQI distribution placement: Balancing the evidence, the objective markers most directly related to PSQI domains (short sleep duration and late sleep timing) are strong and point toward relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the study population. Although psychological resilience and healthy behaviors could mitigate some subjective distress about sleep, the magnitude of the sleep-duration deficit and the blunted circadian amplitude argue that this participant is more likely to fall in the higher half of PSQI scores (worse sleep) within the cohort.

96610,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report profile is characterized by low internalizing symptoms and generally positive psychosocial resources. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 2) and trait anxiety (STAI = 25) are well below the study mean (Z = -1.18 and -1.61, respectively), and subjective happiness and health satisfaction are relatively high (happiness Z = 1.64; health satisfaction Z = 2.05). Self-esteem is elevated (RSES Z = 1.66). Substance use is reported as none for beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs. These psychological and lifestyle features, together with small negative correlations between positive psychosocial measures and PSQI in the study (e.g., self-esteem r ≈ -0.36, health satisfaction r ≈ -0.22), point toward fewer psychosocial drivers of poor sleep in this participant.

Circadian and physiological patterning:
Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively well-structured and robust heart-rate rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.51; Z ≈ 0.83) and 24-hour autocorrelation (0.41; Z ≈ 0.73) are above average in the sample, and amplitude (13.98; Z ≈ 1.03) and MESOR (80.72; Z ≈ 0.92) are also elevated, consistent with a clear day–night physiological rhythm. Intradaily variability is not elevated (0.51; Z ≈ -0.25), suggesting limited fragmentation of activity within days. The hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations between ~1–7 AM) and daytime elevations after ~8 AM, indicating normal nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence and daytime activation. Resting heart rate (60.8 bpm; Z ≈ 0.32) is within a typical range for this population. Overall, these circadian/physiological features are consistent with regular sleep–wake timing and consolidated nighttime rest.

Objective and reported sleep behavior:
Fitbit-derived sleep summaries show a median nightly duration near seven hours (6 h 53 min; Z ≈ -0.37), low-to-moderate night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 96 minutes; Z ≈ -0.10), and relatively consistent sleep onset timing (median start ~01:21; start-time SD ≈ 48 minutes; Z ≈ -0.77). Mean daily naps are rare (0.11 naps/day; Z ≈ 0.44). The combination of habitual, stable bedtimes (low start-time SD), low daytime napping, and consolidated nocturnal heart-rate reductions supports a pattern of consistent nocturnal sleep even though the median sleep onset is late (after 1:00 AM). There are small study-level correlations between sleep timing variability and PSQI (start-time SD r ≈ 0.18), but this participant’s low variability should reduce risk associated with timing instability.

Synthesis and weighing of evidence regarding sleep quality:
Indicators that argue for relatively good or average sleep quality (i.e., a lower PSQI relative to the study population) include: very low depressive and anxiety symptoms (both positively correlated with worse PSQI in the sample), high self-esteem and health satisfaction (negatively correlated with PSQI), regular and robust circadian indices (interdaily stability, amplitude, autocorrelation), low intradaily fragmentation, stable bedtimes, infrequent naps, and median sleep duration close to seven hours. These features, taken together, suggest lower-than-average likelihood of clinically poor sleep in this participant.

Countervailing evidence is limited but should be noted: the habitual bedtime is relatively late (median start ~01:21 AM), and median total sleep time is slightly below eight hours (approximately 6 h 53 min), which may leave less sleep opportunity on early-morning obligations and could contribute to subjective daytime dysfunction for some individuals. However, variability in sleep timing and duration is low, and physiological rhythm metrics indicate consolidated nocturnal rest, mitigating the expected adverse effects of a late bedtime.

Conclusion about PSQI placement:
On balance, the multimodal data (low psychological distress, strong circadian regularity, low sleep-timing variability, near-seven-hour median sleep duration, and minimal substance use) more strongly support placement in the lower half of the study’s PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively better/average sleep quality) than in the top half. The lone notable risk (late habitual sleep onset) is insufficient, given the other protective features, to shift the overall probability toward the poorer-sleep group.

77711,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant presents a mixed psychological profile characterized by elevated trait anxiety alongside otherwise modest symptom burden. Trait anxiety (STAI = 52, Z = +1.06) is meaningfully above the study mean and is among the stronger psychosocial signals relevant for sleep; the STAI score has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in the study (r ≈ 0.40), indicating that higher baseline anxiety is commonly associated with poorer self-reported sleep. Depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 13) is near the sample average (Z ≈ 0) and is not classified as depressed in the study coding, but CES-D has the strongest single correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.49), which makes even subthreshold depressive symptoms relevant for sleep outcomes. The participant’s self-esteem is comparatively low (RSES = 28, Z = -1.43), and lower self-esteem in this sample relates to worse PSQI (r ≈ -0.35). Reported stress levels and health satisfaction are below the sample mean (stress Z = -1.26; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.62), suggesting the participant does not report high perceived stress or poor health despite elevated trait anxiety. Recreational substance use and naps are minimal, and physical activity is modest (exercising alone/with others 1–2×/week), which reduces several common behavioral drivers of sleep disturbance.

Circadian and autonomic patterning from wearable data:
Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a relatively low average heart-rate mesor (Mesor ≈ 68.8 bpm, Z ≈ -0.70) and a low resting heart rate (≈ 52.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.68), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. The rhythm amplitude is close to the population mean (Amplitude ≈ 10.5; Z ≈ -0.08) and the acrophase occurs in the mid-afternoon (~15:28), indicating a typical daytime peak in cardiovascular activation. Non-parametric rhythm metrics show reduced interdaily stability (0.34, Z ≈ -0.57) and modest intradaily variability (0.51, Z ≈ -0.25). Together this pattern suggests the participant’s daily heart-rate rhythm is relatively consistent within days (moderate consolidation) but less consistent across days (reduced day-to-day regularity). Hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor show the expected large nocturnal decline in heart rate (peak negative deviations between ~1–6 AM of roughly -16 to -20 bpm) and daytime peaks in mid-afternoon (largest positive deviations ~+17.8 bpm at 1–2 PM). Small positive correlations between higher nighttime heart-rate deviations and PSQI suggest that relatively elevated nocturnal cardiovascular activity (when present) is associated with poorer subjective sleep in the sample; however, this participant’s nocturnal heart-rate pattern appears to include a substantial overnight reduction relative to mesor, which is typically consistent with consolidated physiologic sleep.

Objective and self-reported sleep behavior:
The participant’s wearable-recorded median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 55 minutes (Z ≈ -0.33), close to but slightly under the sample mean; standard deviation of sleep duration is about 70 minutes (Z ≈ -0.70), indicating modest night-to-night variability that is actually lower than many peers. The median sleep start time is late, around 01:02 AM, with a sleep-start SD of ~55 minutes (Z ≈ -0.62); that pattern indicates a late sleep timing (delayed sleep schedule) but reasonably consistent timing across nights. The participant reports essentially no daytime napping. Overall, on objective duration and nightly variability the participant is near or modestly better than the sample average, but chronotype/timing (sleep onset near 1 AM) is later than many peers.

Integrative interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI):
When integrating psychosocial, behavioral, and physiologic data, there are mixed indicators of sleep health. Objective wearable indices (total nightly duration ≈ 7 hours, low nap frequency, relatively low night-to-night duration variability, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline, low resting HR) point toward generally adequate and consolidated sleep physiology. In contrast, psychosocial and behavioral features known to influence subjective sleep quality are less favorable: elevated trait anxiety (Z ≈ +1.06), relatively low self-esteem (Z ≈ -1.43), and a late habitual sleep onset (median ≈ 1:02 AM) are all associated in this sample with higher PSQI scores and with poorer subjective sleep in prior work. Circadian regularity metrics further indicate reduced interdaily stability, which can exacerbate subjective sleep complaints even when objective duration is adequate. Several of the measures that most strongly correlate with PSQI in the study (STAI and CES-D) place this participant in a profile that is more likely to report sleep disturbances or lower subjective sleep quality, even though purely objective indicators do not strongly point to fragmented or insufficient sleep.

PSQI group classification:
Balancing the objective and subjective indicators, the psychosocial risk factors (notably elevated trait anxiety and low self-esteem) together with late sleep timing and reduced interdaily regularity are likely to increase the participant’s subjective sleep complaints despite near-adequate objective duration and low nap use. On balance, the preponderance of evidence indicates a higher probability of a PSQI in the worse half of the sample distribution.

17020,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant's self-report profile shows modest psychosocial risk but not pronounced affective disturbance. A CES-D score of 10 (Z = -0.34) places reported depressive symptoms below the study mean and in the ""not depressed"" range, and self-esteem is at the scale ceiling (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26). Trait anxiety (STAI = 40) is close to the sample average (Z = -0.13) while perceived stress is elevated relative to peers (stress score = 24, Z = 0.65). Lifestyle habits indicate relatively low social and exercise engagement (exercise and socializing both below population averages) and moderate internet use (2–3 hours/day, Z = 0.85). Alcohol and drug use are minimal. Collectively these data suggest a student who is generally psychologically resilient (low depressive symptoms, high self-esteem) but who experiences above-average stress and limited regular social/exercise routines—factors that can contribute to subjective sleep complaints even when objective sleep duration is adequate.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological indicators:
Cardiovascular circadian metrics show a low overall mesor (mean heart rate MESOR = 59.6 bpm, Z = -1.95) and a low amplitude (7.04 bpm, Z = -1.21), with a resting heart rate of 48.2 bpm (Z = -1.18). These values are consistent with relatively low tonic heart rate, which is often seen in physically fit individuals or those with lower baseline autonomic arousal. The acrophase at ~4:51 PM and the aggregate hourly deviations show the expected nocturnal nadir (substantial negative deviations overnight, e.g., -16.7 bpm around 6–7 AM) and a daytime peak around midday (e.g., +13.7 bpm at 12–1 PM). Non-parametric rhythm features indicate only modest day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.43, Z = 0.17) but elevated intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.64, Z = 0.67), suggesting frequent shifts or variability in activity across the day. In sum, heart-rate rhythms display normal diurnal directionality with low mean heart rate and relatively attenuated amplitude combined with somewhat fragmented daily activity structure—this pattern may reflect good baseline physiological recovery but less stable behavioral scheduling.

Objective sleep behavior and patterns:
Fitbit sleep statistics indicate median nightly sleep duration of approximately 7 hours 7 minutes (Z = -0.08), which is near the study median and within typical recommended ranges. Night-to-night variability in duration is moderate (SD = 108 minutes, Z = 0.17), and naps are rare (mean daily naps = 0.07). A notable behavioral feature is the very late median sleep start time (02:12 AM), although variability in sleep start time is not high (SD = 72 minutes, Z = -0.23). Taken together, the participant obtains an objectively adequate quantity of sleep on average but adheres to a delayed sleep schedule (consistent late bedtimes) and shows some night-to-night variability in total duration. Late habitual bedtime and moderate inconsistency in nightly duration can contribute to subjective sleep disturbance or daytime dysfunction even when total time asleep approximates norms.

Integrative interpretation relative to sleep quality (PSQI):
Evidence for relatively good or average sleep quality includes near-median total sleep time (≈7h), low napping, low depressive symptom burden, strong self-esteem, and low resting heart rate—factors that tend to associate with better objective sleep and daytime functioning. Countervailing evidence for poorer sleep quality includes elevated perceived stress (Z = 0.65), elevated intradaily variability in activity rhythms (Z = 0.67), a very late habitual sleep onset (~2:12 AM), and modest night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD 108 minutes). Correlations in the dataset indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms relate positively to PSQI in this cohort, but this participant's depressive symptoms are low and trait anxiety is near average. On balance, the pattern indicates adequate objective sleep quantity and physiological signs consistent with good baseline recovery, but with behavioral scheduling (late bedtimes) and elevated stress that could modestly degrade subjective sleep quality. The net balance of evidence favors an overall sleep quality nearer to the cohort median or better rather than consistently poor.

PSQI group determination:
Considering objective sleep duration close to the population median, low napping, low depressive symptoms, low resting heart rate, and only moderate rhythm fragmentation and stress, the preponderance of indicators supports classification in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively better or average sleep quality) rather than the upper half. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom 50% of the study population with respect to PSQI score.

Median sleep onset is near 01:57 (about 2:00 AM) with low night-to-night variability in start time (SD = 35 minutes, Z = -1.06) and low variability in nightly duration (SD = 35 minutes, Z = -1.50). Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 56 minutes (Z = -0.31), a value slightly below the study mean but near a typical 7-hour target. Napping is negligible (mean daily naps = 0.07). The combination of a late but stable sleep schedule and low intra-individual variability suggests habitual delayed timing rather than fragmented or irregular sleep; this pattern could produce some subjective impairment linked to social or circadian misalignment (late schedule) even while preserving consolidated nightly sleep.

Circadian and physiological indicators: Heart rate–based circadian features point to a robust and regular day–night rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.45, Z = 1.06) are elevated, while intradaily variability is low (0.43, Z = -0.81), indicating consistent daily structure with little fragmentation of circadian activity. Amplitude of the cosinor fit is relatively high (14.65, Z = 1.25) and the mesor is near the sample average (76.4 bpm, Z = 0.34). Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.2 bpm, Z = -0.59), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal reductions in heart rate (~-26 bpm from ~3:00–7:00 AM, Zs ≈ -1.2 to -1.6), reflecting consolidated, physiologically restorative nighttime periods. Elevated relative heart rate in the late evening (notably a strong positive deviation around 9–10 PM, Value = +18.9, Z = 1.90) suggests higher evening arousal or activity levels, which may contribute to later sleep timing or increased sleep latency for some individuals.

Integration with PSQI-relevant risk and protective factors: Several objective indicators are protective with respect to sleep quality: consistent sleep timing, low night-to-night variability, consolidated nocturnal physiological downregulation, low intradaily variability, and frequent exercise. These features typically predict lower PSQI scores (better sleep) in this sample. Offsetting these protective elements are a habitually late sleep onset near 2:00 AM and modest elevations in depressive and anxiety symptoms, both of which are moderately correlated with worse PSQI (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40). Weekly alcohol consumption and a pronounced evening heart rate elevation also represent potential contributors to subjective sleep disruption or delayed sleep initiation. Overall, the objective wearable profile indicates physiologically regular and consolidated sleep, while self-reported mood symptoms and late timing introduce some risk for subjective sleep complaints.

Overall assessment of PSQI group placement: Balancing objective and subjective indicators, the preponderance of evidence suggests sleep quality more consistent with the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively better/average sleep) rather than the top half. Objective circadian regularity, low variability in sleep timing and duration, consolidated nocturnal heart rate reductions, and regular exercise are strong protective signals. While late habitual sleep timing and modest depressive/anxiety symptoms are risk factors for higher PSQI scores, their magnitude here is moderate and appears insufficient to outweigh the strong objective regularity and consolidation. Taken holistically, the participant most plausibly falls in the bottom 50% of the study PSQI distribution (better/average sleep quality).

79167,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Sleep behavior and objective sleep duration: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration of 8 hours 11 minutes (Z = +1.25 relative to the study sample), with a median sleep onset near 23:31 and a modest night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 65 minutes, Z ≈ −0.39) and in total sleep duration (SD ≈ 87 minutes, Z ≈ −0.32). The participant reported essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z ≈ −0.86). These metrics indicate that, on objective measures, the participant obtains longer sleep than the average student in this sample and does not rely on naps to achieve total sleep time; sleep timing is around a conventional late-evening bedtime with only moderate variability across nights.

Circadian organization and heart-rate patterns: Cosinor and non-parametric rhythm metrics present a mixed picture. The participant’s interdaily stability is relatively low (0.28, Z = −1.07), suggesting less-consistent day-to-day structure in heart rate rhythms across the recording period. Intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.65, Z = +0.74), consistent with somewhat more fragmented or punctuated activity/physiological patterns within days. Parametric features show a low amplitude (7.58, Z = −1.03) and a relatively low mesor (67.99, Z = −0.81) alongside a low resting heart rate (52.7 bpm, Z = −0.65). Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show the expected nocturnal heart-rate nadir (largest negative deviations around 3–4 AM, approximately −20 to −21 bpm) and a strong morning rise (notably positive deviations 6–9 AM, with particularly high Z-scores at 6–7 AM and 7–8 AM). Overall, the physiology resembles a low-resting-rate profile with a pronounced morning cardiovascular activation but with some loss of regularity in daily rhythm timing across days.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context: Self-report instruments indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and favorable psychosocial functioning. Depressive symptom scores (CES-D = 3, Z ≈ −1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI = 24, Z ≈ −1.71) are well below sample means, while self-reported happiness and health satisfaction are above average (happiness Z ≈ +1.64; health satisfaction Z ≈ +2.05). The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercise and sports three or more times per week, Z-scores > +1) and minimal recreational drug use; alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week). These lifestyle and psychological indicators generally align with behavioral patterns that support good sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality. Correlational guidance in the dataset shows that higher depressive and anxious symptoms are associated with worse PSQI in this sample; the participant’s low scores on those traits therefore point toward relatively better PSQI.

Integration and implications for sleep quality: Combining the domains, the most salient features are objectively long nightly sleep, lack of daytime napping, an evening bed-time around 23:30 with moderate night-to-night consistency, low resting heart rate and a normal nocturnal heart-rate nadir, and favorable psychosocial and behavioral correlates (low mood/anxiety, high health satisfaction, regular exercise). Countervailing signals include reduced interdaily stability and mildly elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythms, which indicate some irregularity in daily structure that could, in other contexts, contribute to poorer subjective sleep. However, these circadian irregularities are moderate in magnitude, and most direct indicators of sleep quantity, timing stability, and psychosocial support suggest relatively good sleep. Correlations provided in the dataset are generally modest and do not indicate a strong signal towards poor sleep for this participant.

Overall PSQI-group assessment: On balance of objective sleep duration (above sample median), sleep timing regularity (moderate), absence of naps, low affective symptoms, and healthful behaviors, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the sample distribution for PSQI score (i.e., relatively better sleep quality). The moderate reductions in circadian stability introduce some uncertainty but do not outweigh the consistent indicators of adequate sleep duration and low psychological distress.

22455,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"The wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate shorter and somewhat irregular nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 7 minutes (Z = -1.33 relative to the study sample), which is meaningfully below the population median and below typical adult recommendations; within the dataset this shorter duration is likely to increase sleep-related complaints captured by the PSQI. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (standard deviation = 142 minutes, Z = 0.94) and sleep start times are moderately variable (start-time SD = 66 minutes, Z = -0.37), together suggesting inconsistent sleep opportunity across days. Daytime napping is uncommon (mean daily naps = 0.13, Z = 0.7) so naps are unlikely to be compensating for short nocturnal sleep.

Circadian and cardiovascular signatures point to a blunted and less regular daily rhythm. Parametric circadian measures from heart rate show a relatively low amplitude (6.07, Z = -1.52) and a lower MESOR (66.33, Z = -1.04), while non-parametric interdaily stability is reduced (0.30, Z = -0.90) and intradaily variability is slightly elevated (0.59, Z = 0.32). These features indicate a weaker and less stable 24-hour structure in physiological arousal, which is often associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced morning rise (notably 5–6 AM with a +24.37 bpm deviation, Z = 6.20) and deep overnight troughs, consistent with clear wake/sleep contrasts on single days but with diminished overall amplitude and day-to-day regularity; the large morning spike may reflect strong activity at wake or measurement/aggregation effects but does not negate the general signal of reduced circadian amplitude and stability.

Psychological and behavioral self-report data provide mixed influences on sleep quality. Protective factors include low depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14), low trait anxiety (STAI = 28, Z = -1.31), high self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.1), frequent solitary exercise (three times per week, Z = 1.07), low substance use, and relatively high health satisfaction and self-reported happiness (both high Z-scores). In contrast, perceived stress is elevated (Stress score = 30, Z = 2.28), and recreational screen time (watching TV/videos 3–4 hours, Z = 2.54; internet/music 3–4 hours, Z ≈ 1.5–1.6) is high; both elevated stress and late-evening screen exposure are associated with poorer sleep in this cohort. Low interpersonal trust (Z = -2.71) is notable but its direct relation to sleep in these data is modest. Overall, the profile shows psychological resilience on some fronts (low mood/anxiety, good health satisfaction) but elevated stress and evening sedentary screen behaviors that are plausibly disruptive to sleep.

Integrative interpretation and implications for PSQI grouping: the strongest indicators that map onto higher PSQI scores in this participant are the objectively short median sleep duration (Z = -1.33), elevated night-to-night variability in sleep duration (Z ≈ 0.94), reduced circadian amplitude and interdaily stability (Z ≈ -1.5 and -0.9, respectively), and elevated perceived stress (Z = 2.28). These features have nontrivial, directionally consistent relationships with worse PSQI-domain scores in the cohort (e.g., sleep variability and stress correlate positively with PSQI). Countervailing evidence—low depression/anxiety, regular exercise, low substance use, and high health satisfaction—are protective but, in aggregate, do not fully offset the combination of short, variable sleep and circadian irregularity. On balance, the multimodal evidence more strongly aligns with relatively poorer sleep quality compared with the study median.

57443,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Sleep timing, duration, and circadian physiology
The participant’s wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics indicate a generally regular and consolidated nocturnal sleep pattern. Median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 14 minutes (Z ≈ 0), which is within typical recommended ranges and close to the study mean. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is low (SD ≈ 42 minutes; Z = -1.33), and the participant recorded essentially no naps (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86), both of which reduce fragmentation and are consistent with more stable sleep. Median sleep onset near 00:24 with a modest SD in sleep-start timing (~81 minutes) indicates a somewhat delayed but not highly erratic bedtime. Cosinor-derived circadian features also reflect a structured rhythm: moderate-to-high interdaily stability (value 0.50; Z = 0.75) and high 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.15) point to regular day-to-day timing of physiological activity, while intradaily variability is near the cohort mean (Z ≈ 0.03), implying limited daytime–nighttime fragmentation. Hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and predictable daytime peaks (largest positive deviations in early- to mid-afternoon and early evening), consistent with intact diurnal physiology rather than blunted or highly irregular circadian drive.

Psychological, behavioral, and lifestyle context
Self-report measures provide a mixed psychosocial picture that could influence subjective sleep quality even when objective metrics are reasonable. The CES-D score (19) indicates elevated depressive symptoms relative to the sample (Z = 0.59) and the CES-D has a moderate positive correlation with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.5), suggesting depressive symptoms may be associated with worse subjective sleep. Perceived stress is also elevated (score = 25; Z = 0.92) but has only a modest correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.2). Trait anxiety is near average (STAI = 40; Z = -0.13). Protective behaviors are present: minimal substance use, no recorded recreational drug or alcohol use, no daytime napping, and stable sleep timing; however, exercise frequency is low, which could reduce daytime sleep pressure. Self-esteem and current happiness are at or slightly above the cohort mean (Rosenberg score 39; happiness 4.0), which may buffer some negative effects of stress. Overall, lifestyle factors that commonly degrade sleep (substance use, high evening screen time, frequent napping) are largely absent, but elevated depressive symptoms and stress could primarily affect subjective sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality (PSQI)
Objective wearables and sleep-timing indicators converge on a pattern of adequate, regular nocturnal sleep: typical duration, low night-to-night variability, consistent circadian rhythm measures, and clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir. These features are associated with lower PSQI scores in the cohort (i.e., better sleep). Counterbalancing this is the participant’s elevated depressive symptom burden and higher perceived stress, both of which are correlated with poorer PSQI in the sample and could disproportionately influence subjective sleep components (sleep latency, perceived sleep quality, daytime dysfunction). Given the relatively strong objective evidence for consolidated and regular sleep and the modest-to-moderate psychosocial risk factors, the overall balance favors an outcome of average-to-good sleep quality. In other words, while subjective complaints could be present due to mood and stress, the multimodal objective profile is more consistent with a PSQI in the lower or median half of the population distribution rather than the upper half.

Conclusion and group classification
Weighing objective wearable indicators (typical duration, low variability, regular circadian metrics, no napping) more heavily than the moderate psychosocial risk (elevated depressive symptoms and stress), the most likely placement for this participant’s overall PSQI score is in the bottom half of the study distribution (i.e., lower/average PSQI indicating relatively better sleep quality).

94579,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and affective profile:
The participant shows elevated depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 24, Z = +1.11) and moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = +0.27). These affective measures have relatively strong positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.50, STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating that higher depressive and anxiety symptoms in this participant are plausibly linked to poorer sleep quality. Self-esteem is slightly below average (RSES = 37, Z = -0.17) and self-reported happiness and trust are below the population mean (happiness Z = -0.53; trust Z = -0.46), whereas perceived health satisfaction is above average (Z = +0.55). Stress scores are low relative to the sample (Z = -1.26), which may mitigate some sleep disruption, but the pattern of elevated mood symptoms is the dominant psychological signal and is typically associated with worse subjective sleep.

Reported sleep habits and wearable sleep metrics:
Wearable-derived sleep characteristics show a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 38 minutes (Z = -0.69), which is below the population mean and below common recommendations for young adults. Night-to-night variability in sleep is very large: sleep duration standard deviation is 242 minutes (Z = +3.21) and sleep start time standard deviation is 153 minutes (Z = +1.54). The typical sleep onset is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:07 AM). These features—short average sleep, late and highly variable bedtimes—are behavioral patterns that commonly relate to poorer sleep quality. The participant reports essentially no daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86), which reduces one potential confound but does not offset the late and irregular nocturnal schedule.

Circadian and physiological rhythms from wearable data:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics indicate modestly structured rhythms: interdaily stability is somewhat above average (0.49, Z = +0.67) and intradaily variability is near the sample median (0.52, Z = -0.18), suggesting a generally present but not highly rigid circadian pattern. Cosinor-derived mesor (≈72 bpm, Z = -0.27) and amplitude (≈12 bpm, Z = +0.39) are near average. The aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM, up to ≈ -22 to -19 bpm) and daytime peaks (e.g., +15 bpm at 10–11 AM and ∼+13 bpm at 2–3 PM). Resting heart rate is slightly below the sample mean (57.6 bpm, Z = -0.07). Together, these physiological signals are consistent with normal sleep-wake related cardiac modulation but do not indicate a strongly robust, well-timed circadian profile that would counteract the behavioral irregularities; the acrophase (≈4:17 PM) is within a typical late-afternoon peak for activity.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
Key risk-relevant features for poorer sleep quality are prominent: elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both positively correlated with PSQI in the sample), a late median sleep onset (~2:07 AM), and very high night-to-night variability in both sleep duration and timing (extremely elevated z-scores for variability). Average nightly sleep is somewhat short. Protective features include frequent exercise (three times/week or more across multiple categories), low substance and nonprescription drug use, lack of napping, and moderate health satisfaction; these factors may attenuate some sleep disturbance but do not offset the strong signals associated with mood symptoms and extreme sleep irregularity. Correlational evidence in the study shows depressive symptoms and anxiety are among the strongest predictors of higher PSQI; sleep timing variability and duration variability also show positive associations with PSQI (albeit smaller). The wearable circadian measures do not show unusually poor stability but also do not demonstrate compensatory robustness.

PSQI group inference:
Balancing the evidence, the participant’s combination of elevated depressive symptoms, moderate anxiety, late average sleep onset, and very high variability in bedtime and sleep duration make it more likely that their global PSQI score falls into the higher (worse) half of the study distribution. While some protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use) and an average resting heart rate are present, the magnitude of affective burden and sleep irregularity are stronger predictors in this dataset. Therefore the participant is more likely to be in the top 50% of PSQI scores (representing relatively worse sleep quality).

29257,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report measures indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and generally positive self-appraisal. Scores on the CES-D (Z = -1.18) and STAI–Trait (Z = -1.02) are well below the study mean, indicating few depressive symptoms and low trait anxiety during the assessment window. Self-esteem and health satisfaction are above-average (self-esteem Z = 1.1; health satisfaction Z = 0.72), and reported perceived stress is below average (Z = -0.71). Substance use is light-to-moderate (beer 1–2×/week; other substances rarely used). Daily recreational patterns show especially high time spent listening to music and relatively low time in sedentary hobbies, reading, or gaming. Overall, affective and health-related self-reports form a profile that would generally be expected to protect against poor subjective sleep quality.

Behavioral sleep metrics from wearables:
Objective sleep metrics from the Fitbit show a relatively long median sleep duration of 7 hours 49 minutes (Z = 0.79), and the participant does not regularly nap (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). These values suggest sufficient total sleep opportunity on average. However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration is pronounced (SD = 151 minutes, Z = 1.14), and the median sleep start time is late (01:32:30). Sleep start time variability is moderate (SD = 82 minutes). Taken together, the pattern is one of adequate average sleep quantity but inconsistent timing and high inter-night variability, which are behavioral features often associated with degraded sleep continuity and subjective sleep complaints even when mean duration is sufficient.

Circadian and physiological patterns:
Heart-rate–derived circadian summary metrics show an irregular but not highly fragmented rhythm: interdaily stability is low (0.26, Z = -1.23), indicating that day-to-day timing of the rhythmic signal is relatively inconsistent across the recording period; intradaily variability is modestly below average (0.46, Z = -0.60), indicating limited high-frequency fragmentation. The cosinor amplitude is lower than average (8.46 bpm, Z = -0.75) with a mesor around 73 bpm (Z = -0.13) and acrophase near early evening (≈5:43 PM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (59.2 bpm, Z = 0.12 in this sample), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness or low tonic arousal. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor demonstrate pronounced nocturnal heart rate declines (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–7:00 AM) and daytime elevations centered around midday–afternoon; several overnight hourly deviations show small positive correlations with PSQI in the sample, consistent with the possibility that greater nocturnal perturbations relate to worse sleep quality. Overall the physiologic pattern is one of a healthy baseline cardiovascular state but with a circadian signal that lacks strong day-to-day regularity.

Synthesis regarding sleep quality:
The participant presents a mixed profile with protective and risk factors for good subjective sleep. Protective features: adequate average sleep duration (≈7 h 49 m), low depressive and anxiety symptoms, low reported stress, and a relatively low resting heart rate—factors that typically predict better subjective sleep quality. Risk features: consistently late sleep timing (median start ~1:30 AM), marked night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD high), and reduced interdaily stability of circadian physiology—factors empirically associated with poorer sleep continuity and higher PSQI scores. Correlational guidance in the dataset shows that variability in sleep duration and aspects of nocturnal physiological irregularity have modest positive associations with PSQI in this population, reinforcing concern that inconsistent scheduling could degrade perceived sleep quality.

PSQI group decision (holistic assessment):
Balancing the evidence, the most salient predictors of worse PSQI in this participant are the large inter-night variability in sleep duration and the low interdaily stability (irregular daily timing), together with late habitual sleep onset. Although average sleep duration and low affective symptoms argue for relatively good sleep, the magnitude of schedule irregularity and variability are likely to have a meaningful negative impact on subjective sleep quality. On balance, the participant’s multimodal profile is more consistent with a PSQI score in the higher (worse) half of the study distribution.

The participant reports very low depressive and anxiety symptom burden (CES-D = 3, z ≈ -1.07; STAI Trait = 23, z ≈ -1.81), relatively high self-esteem (RSES z ≈ +0.96) and good self-rated health satisfaction (z ≈ +0.8). Stress is near the sample mean (raw 22, z ≈ +0.1). Substance use is essentially absent across alcohol and recreational drugs, and BMI (19.7) is in a healthy range. Exercise reports show modest engagement (sports 1–2×/week) but infrequent solitary exercise. Overall, the survey profile indicates low affective symptom burden, generally healthy lifestyle indicators, and limited substance-related risk factors that are commonly associated with poorer sleep.

Sleep timing and sleep quantity (wearable + self-report):
Objectively, median nightly sleep duration is within recommended ranges at about 7 hours 20 minutes (z ≈ +0.18), and the participant records essentially no naps (z ≈ -0.86). Night-to-night variability is low: sleep duration standard deviation ≈ 36 minutes (z ≈ -1.47) and sleep start time SD ≈ 39 minutes (z ≈ -0.96), indicating a consistent sleep schedule. However, the median sleep start time is late (about 01:45 AM), consistent with an evening chronotype. The combination of adequate sleep duration with low intra-individual variability suggests stable, sufficient sleep opportunity despite late timing.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology (wearable-derived):
Circadian-derived summary metrics show modest interdaily stability (0.50, z ≈ +0.75) but elevated intradaily variability (0.83, z ≈ +2.01). This pattern indicates reasonably consistent day-to-day timing of the circadian rhythm but relatively greater fragmentation or within-day variability in heart-rate activity. Mesor is low (62.4 bpm, z ≈ -1.57) and resting heart rate is low (47.8 bpm, z ≈ -1.23), both consistent with relatively good cardiovascular fitness. The cosinor acrophase is about 5:26 PM, and amplitude is modest (11.4), indicating a typical afternoon/evening peak in heart-rate activity. Hourly aggregated deviations show an expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations during typical sleep hours, up to ~-24 bpm) and daytime elevations in the late morning and afternoon (+15 to +18 bpm). There is an isolated hourly value with an unusually large positive deviation (value ≈ +35.6, z ≈ +4.79), indicating a consistently high-arousal hour in the daily profile; this deserves cautious interpretation (could reflect a reliably active period of the day or a measurement/aggregation artifact) but does not, by itself, indicate poor sleep.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI-relevant indicators):
Putting the modalities together, the strongest signals relevant to sleep quality are: 1) objectively adequate and stable total sleep time (favorable for good PSQI scores), 2) late habitual bedtime (a potential contributor to subjective sleep disturbance or daytime dysfunction in some contexts), and 3) elevated intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythms (suggesting within-day fragmentation of physiological state, which can relate to fragmented sleep or variable arousal). Psychological risk factors that commonly worsen sleep (depression, trait anxiety, substance use) are minimal in this participant, which favors better sleep quality. Correlations provided in the dataset show that depressive and anxiety symptoms are positively associated with PSQI in the cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), but this participant’s low scores on those scales reduce the likelihood of a high PSQI. Objective sleep-duration correlations with PSQI are small (sleep duration median r ≈ 0.05), and the participant’s stable, adequate duration therefore does not point strongly toward a poor PSQI. The elevated intradaily variability is a cautionary physiological indicator but its cohort correlation with PSQI is negligible (r ≈ 0.01), so its contribution to predicting a high PSQI in this individual is uncertain.

Holistic assessment and PSQI group assignment:
On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports reasonably good or average sleep quality. Objective sleep duration and its stability, low daytime napping, low affective symptoms, low substance use, and favorable cardiovascular fitness argue for PSQI scores in the lower half of the study distribution (i.e., better sleep). The principal counterpoints are the late sleep timing (median start ~01:45) and elevated intradaily variability in heart-rate rhythms; these could negatively affect subjective sleep quality for some individuals but, given the participant’s otherwise favorable profile and the generally small cohort-level correlations between those features and PSQI, they are insufficient to outweigh the favorable indicators. Therefore the most likely classification is that this participant’s overall PSQI falls in the bottom half (better/average sleep quality) of the study population.

63904,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile
The participant’s self-report profile indicates elevated affective symptoms alongside low positive self-appraisals and reduced social trust. Depressive symptom burden is high (CES-D = 30, Z = 1.74, classification provided as ""Depressed"") and trait anxiety is also elevated (STAI = 53, Z = 1.16); both of these measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study sample (r ≈ 0.5 and 0.4 respectively). Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES = 30, Z = -1.15), and single-item happiness and trust scores are notably low (happiness Z = -1.61; trust Z = -2.07). Stress is modestly elevated (score = 23, Z = 0.38). Collectively this pattern indicates pronounced internalizing symptoms and lower positive social-emotional resources, features that are, in this dataset, associated with worse subjective sleep quality.

Sleep behavior and subjective sleep metrics
Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a habitual pattern of late and relatively short nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration was 5 hours 49 minutes (Z = -1.69), with a median sleep start time near 01:34 AM and modest night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 30 minutes, Z = -1.61; sleep start SD ≈ 60 minutes, Z = -0.5). The participant reports essentially no daily naps. The combination of a late sleep onset and mean sleep duration under six hours points to restricted nocturnal sleep opportunity and suggests likely contributors to PSQI domains tied to sleep duration and daytime dysfunction. Low night-to-night variability indicates this pattern is relatively stable rather than sporadic, which may reduce the contribution of irregularity but does not eliminate the negative effects of chronically short sleep.

Wearable physiological and circadian indicators
Heart rate–based circadian features reveal a generally structured 24-hour rhythm with somewhat above-average interdaily stability (0.53, Z = 1.0) and a positive 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 1.06), indicating the participant follows a consistent daily schedule across the recording period. Intradaily variability is mildly elevated (0.63, Z = 0.6), consistent with some within-day fragmentation of activity or arousal. Resting heart rate and MESOR are near the sample mean (RHR 60.5 bpm, MESOR ≈ 76.7 bpm), and the cosinor amplitude is modest (10.6, Z ≈ -0.06) with an acrophase in the mid-afternoon (≈ 3:36 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show the expected nocturnal heart rate nadir (largest negative deviations between ~1–6 AM, up to ≈ -21 bpm), with morning and late-afternoon elevations; this pattern is physiologically typical and suggests intact nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation despite the short sleep duration.

Integration and likely contributors to sleep quality
When integrating self-report and wearable data, the dominant signals relevant to PSQI are the chronically short nocturnal sleep duration (<6 hours), late habitual sleep onset (~1:30 AM), and elevated internalizing symptoms (notably depressive symptoms and trait anxiety) that have relatively strong positive correlations with PSQI in the sample. Although the participant shows relatively stable day-to-day scheduling (higher interdaily stability; low sleep variability) and preserved nocturnal heart rate dipping, these protective features are outweighed by insufficient sleep opportunity and marked mood/anxiety symptoms, both of which typically increase subjective sleep complaints and PSQI scores. Low daytime napping reduces the likelihood that short nocturnal sleep is being compensated, increasing the likelihood of daytime dysfunction items on the PSQI.

Overall PSQI group classification
Evidence supporting lower/median PSQI (bottom half): the participant has a consistent sleep schedule (higher interdaily stability, low SD of sleep duration), minimal napping, and physiological nocturnal heart rate decline indicative of preserved circadian downregulation—factors that can be associated with better objective sleep consolidation. Evidence supporting higher PSQI (top half): median nightly sleep duration well below 6 hours (Z = -1.69), late sleep onset (~1:34 AM), elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety (both strongly correlated with PSQI in this dataset), and self-reported low happiness and trust. On balance, the preponderance and magnitude of indicators tied to poorer subjective sleep (short duration, late timing, and pronounced affective symptoms with strong correlations to PSQI) outweigh the modest protective circadian regularity. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the upper half of the study distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively poorer sleep quality).

20335,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report measures indicate a generally favorable psychological profile for sleep health. Depressive symptoms are very low (CES-D = 2.0; Z = -1.18), and trait anxiety is likewise low (STAI = 23; Z = -1.81); both scales in this dataset correlate positively with worse PSQI scores, so the participant’s low values point toward fewer sleep complaints related to mood and anxiety. Self-esteem (RSES Z = 1.66), current happiness (Z = 1.64), and health satisfaction (Z = 1.3) are above the sample mean and are modestly associated with lower PSQI in the cohort. Reported stress is below average (Z = -0.71). Taken together, the psychological and subjective health measures suggest favorable emotional functioning and daytime wellbeing, which are factors that typically accompany lower overall PSQI scores.

Sleep timing, duration, and behavioral context:
Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a late but consistent sleep schedule: median sleep start time is approximately 01:54 AM with low night-to-night variability (sleep-start SD = 27 minutes; Z = -1.24), indicating a stable late chronotype rather than highly irregular timing. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 35 minutes (Z = -0.74), moderately shorter than the cohort average but not extreme; night-to-night variability of duration is modest (SD = 86 minutes; Z = -0.33). Self-reported daytime activities indicate frequent solo exercise (3+ times/week; Z = 1.07), substantial socializing (3–4 hours; Z = 1.74), high engagement in sedentary hobbies (Z = 2.01), and notable video-game and music use—behavioral patterns that may help explain a late habitual bedtime. The low mean daily nap rate (0.08 naps/day) suggests sleep is mainly consolidated overnight. Overall, the participant displays a stable late sleep schedule with slightly short total sleep time but little variability across nights.

Circadian and physiological indicators:
Circadian summary metrics from heart-rate data indicate fairly regular rhythms: interdaily stability (0.57; Z = 1.33) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 0.9) are above average, and amplitude and mesor are modestly elevated (amplitude Z = 0.9; mesor Z = 0.57). Resting heart rate is relatively low (55 bpm; Z = -0.37), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregate deviations show an unusual spike in mean heart-rate deviation at 12–1 AM (value 23.9; Z = 3.66), with other overnight hours (1–7 AM) showing expected large negative deviations from the mesor. Elevated cardiovascular activation around midnight and at later evening hours (e.g., 6–7 PM and 11 PM) suggests periods of evening physiological arousal or activity prior to the habitual sleep onset time. Despite this evening arousal, the high interdaily stability and low variability in sleep-start times indicate the participant maintains a consistent late-phase rhythm rather than a fragmented or highly irregular schedule.

Behavioral synthesis and likely impacts on sleep quality:
Psychological risk factors most strongly associated with poor sleep in this cohort (depressive and anxiety symptoms) are minimal for this participant, which favors a lower PSQI (better sleep quality). Protective features include regularity of sleep timing, frequent exercise, low daytime napping, and positive self-reported wellbeing. Countervailing signals are the late habitual bedtime (~1:54 AM), moderately short median sleep duration (~6.6 hours), and elevated heart-rate deviation around midnight that likely reflect evening arousal (social or screen-based activity) before sleep. Taken together, these patterns describe a stable late chronotype with generally good psychosocial functioning but somewhat reduced sleep opportunity. The balance of evidence—particularly the strong protective psychological profile, high circadian regularity, low variability in sleep timing, and normal daytime functioning—suggests that the participant’s overall sleep-related impairment is more likely to fall in the lower half of PSQI scores (i.e., relatively good or average sleep quality) rather than the upper half.

Overall PSQI group classification:
The preponderance of protective indicators (very low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-reported wellbeing, regular sleep timing, and high interdaily stability) outweigh the moderate risks (late bedtime, slightly short sleep duration, evening physiological arousal). Consequently, the participant is more likely to have a PSQI in the bottom 50% of the study population distribution.

35031,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate a generally low level of affective disturbance and modest psychosocial risk factors for poor sleep. The participant reports low depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 27, Z = -1.41). Perceived stress is below the study mean (Score = 18, Z = -0.98), and self-esteem is above average (RSES Z = 0.68). Social engagement is relatively high (socializing 2–3 hours, Z = 0.95), and substance use is limited to moderate weekly alcohol consumption (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week, Z ≈ 1.0) with no recreational or non-prescribed drug use. Together these self-report indicators are more consistent with adequate subjective sleep health (lower PSQI risk correlates with lower depression and anxiety in the population correlations provided) rather than with severe sleep disturbance.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns: Heart rate–based circadian metrics show a high overall cardiac set point and blunted rhythmicity. Resting heart rate is elevated relative to the sample (75.5 bpm, Z = 2.06) and MESOR is above average (82.2, Z = 1.13), while amplitude is low (5.05, Z = -1.85). Non-parametric circadian measures indicate poor between-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.19, Z = -1.81 and autocorrelation at 24 h Z = -1.87) with relatively high within-day fragmentation (intradaily variability Z = 1.16). The hourly aggregated deviations show the greatest reductions from the mesor during the typical sleep window (large negative deviations between ~2:00–7:00 AM, e.g., -9.67 at 5–6 AM) but also pronounced positive deviations late in the evening around 10–12 PM (e.g., 9.94 at 11–12 AM) and in the late afternoon/early evening (5–6 PM). These features together suggest a raised baseline cardiovascular tone with reduced circadian amplitude and irregular day-to-day timing of activity/arousal, and some evening-period cardiovascular activation relative to the participant’s mean. Elevated resting heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude/interdaily stability are modestly associated with poorer PSQI in the population correlations provided.

Objective sleep behavior and timing: Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate longer-than-average sleep duration (median 8 h 3 min, Z = 1.08) and relatively few naps (mean daily naps 0.14, Z = 0.82). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration (SD = 91 min, Z = -0.21) and sleep onset timing (median start 00:16, SD = 96 min, Z = 0.28) are not extreme; sleep timing is centered shortly after midnight but with moderate variability. Longer total sleep time and relatively infrequent napping are features that would generally decrease PSQI component scores related to sleep duration and daytime dysfunction; however, the moderate variability in start time and evidence of evening physiological activation could contribute to subjective latency or sleep disturbances for some nights.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI): The self-report psychological profile (low depression/anxiety, low stress, reasonably high self-esteem and social engagement) and objective behavior of relatively long nightly sleep and minimal napping argue in favor of average-to-good sleep quality. Offsetting these protective features are wearable-derived markers of circadian instability and blunted amplitude (interdaily stability and amplitude both very low, Z ≈ -1.8) together with an elevated resting heart rate (Z = 2.06) and late-evening heart rate elevations. Population correlations show depressive symptoms and trait anxiety relate more strongly to PSQI than the cardiac circadian measures in this dataset; given the participant’s low affective symptoms, the psychosocial evidence favors lower PSQI. The physiological circadian irregularity and raised resting heart rate are risk factors for poorer subjective sleep, but their correlations with PSQI are modest in the provided summary. On balance, the weight of evidence—particularly the combination of low depressive/anxiety symptoms, long median sleep duration, few naps, and lack of marked daytime dysfunction in self-reports—supports placement in the lower (better) half of the PSQI distribution rather than the upper (worse) half.

88185,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report data indicate a favorable psychological profile relative to the study sample. Depressive symptoms are low (CES-D = 7, Z = -0.66) and trait anxiety is low (STAI = 29, Z = -1.22), while self-reported happiness and self-esteem are above average (Happy = 5, Z = 1.64; SelfEsteem Z = 0.82). The participant reports minimal substance use (no alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drug use) and engages in regular solitary exercise (three times or more per week, Z = 1.07). Together, these trait and lifestyle indicators are typically associated with fewer sleep complaints and better daytime functioning; several of these measures also show correlations in the expected directions with PSQI in the dataset (e.g., CES-D and STAI positively correlated with worse PSQI, self-esteem and happiness negatively correlated), supporting an interpretation of generally low affective burden and healthy daytime behaviors.

Sleep timing and duration characteristics: Wearable-recorded sleep shows a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 37 minutes (Z = -0.70), indicating somewhat shorter sleep than the cohort mean but not extreme. Night-to-night variability in duration is relatively low (SD = 62 minutes, Z = -0.87), and naps are essentially absent (mean daily naps 0.0, Z = -0.86). The participant’s typical sleep onset is late (median sleep start ≈ 02:25 AM) with moderate variability in start time (SD ≈ 88 minutes, Z = 0.11). Clinically and practically, the late average bedtime is the most salient sleep-habit feature: it may contribute to reduced total opportunity for sleep relative to a conventional schedule and can influence subjective components of sleep quality even when duration is moderately maintained. However, the combination of restricted but consistent sleep timing and low variability suggests a stable sleep schedule across days, which often mitigates some adverse effects of shorter sleep.

Circadian and physiological indicators: Heart rate–based circadian metrics indicate a relatively robust and regular physiological rhythm. Interdaily stability is elevated (0.57, Z = 1.33), suggesting consistent day-to-day timing of activity/arousal patterns. Intradaily variability is not elevated (0.5, Z = -0.32), indicating limited fragmentation of rhythm across the day. Cosinor-derived amplitude is larger than average (amplitude = 14.05, Z = 1.06) with a mesor around 79.5 bpm (Z = 0.76) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:00 PM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (57.3 bpm, Z = -0.10). The hourly aggregated deviations show clear overnight decreases in heart rate and daytime elevations, consistent with intact nocturnal downregulation and daytime activation. Altogether these physiological markers point to a structured, high-amplitude circadian profile and intact nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence—features that commonly correspond to consolidated nocturnal sleep and stable sleep–wake timing.

Integrative interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI): Evidence that would predict relatively good or average sleep quality includes low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem, minimal substance use, regular exercise, absence of naps, low night-to-night sleep variability, and strong interdaily circadian stability with intact nocturnal heart-rate decline. These factors collectively favor a lower PSQI (better sleep). Countervailing evidence for worse sleep quality is principally the late habitual sleep onset (median ~02:25 AM) and a slightly shorter-than-average sleep duration (≈6 h 37 m). Late timing can contribute to subjective or functional sleep complaints and is modestly correlated with PSQI in the sample; however, in this case the late schedule appears to be stable rather than irregular, and objective physiological markers do not show fragmentation or instability that would commonly accompany chronically poor sleep. On balance, the preponderance of evidence (low affective distress, behavioral health supports, high circadian regularity, low variability in sleep duration) suggests the participant’s global sleep quality is more consistent with the lower-to-median range of PSQI scores in this cohort rather than the upper half.

35344,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Psychological profile and self-report signals:
The participant’s self-report profile is characterized by elevated internalizing symptomatology: a CES-D score of 28 (Z = 1.53) and an STAI–Trait score of 62 (Z = 2.05) indicate substantial depressive and chronic-anxiety symptom burden relative to the study sample. Complementary measures show low self-esteem (Rosenberg score = 27, Z = -1.57) and low current happiness (score = 2.0, Z = -1.61), with a modestly elevated perceived stress score (24, Z = 0.65). These psychological variables are among the stronger correlates of PSQI in the dataset (CES-D r ≈ 0.49, STAI r ≈ 0.40; self-esteem r ≈ -0.35), implying that the participant’s subjective experience of sleep is likely to be affected by affective distress and trait anxiety even if some objective indices are favorable.

Behavioral habits relevant to sleep:
Behavioral factors that typically influence sleep are mixed. The participant reports regular, frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more) and limited napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86), both of which generally support consolidated nocturnal sleep. Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week), which can increase sleep fragmentation or perceived poor quality even when total duration is preserved. Social and recreational evening activities are relatively low (limited socializing, low internet/video/music use), which may reduce evening stimulation and promote consistent bedtimes.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show objectively favorable sleep duration and regularity. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 47 minutes (Z = 0.74), with a sleep duration standard deviation of ~92 minutes (Z = -0.21) and a median sleep start time just after midnight (00:03; SD ≈ 61 minutes, Z = -0.48). These objective data indicate sufficient average sleep opportunity and modest night-to-night consistency. Circadian heart-rate features indicate a coherent circadian pattern: interdaily stability (0.44, Z = 0.25) and modest intradaily variability (0.56, Z = 0.10) suggest relatively stable daily organization of activity and physiology across the recording period. Hourly heart-rate deviations show the expected nocturnal reduction (largest negative deviations roughly 2–5 AM) and daytime rises with an acrophase around mid-afternoon (≈3:51 PM), consistent with preserved circadian amplitude. Resting heart rate is somewhat elevated (63.8 bpm, Z = 0.67), which may reflect physiological arousal or fitness/body composition factors (BMI ≈ 29).

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality:
Taken together, objective wearable metrics (sleep duration ~7.8 h, consistent bedtimes, low napping, reasonable circadian stability and nocturnal heart-rate dipping) point to physiologically adequate and regular sleep opportunity. However, the participant’s pronounced depressive and anxiety symptomatology, low self-esteem, and reduced happiness are robust predictors of poorer subjective sleep quality in this cohort (notably CES-D and STAI correlate most strongly with PSQI). Moderate alcohol consumption could further degrade perceived sleep quality or increase nocturnal micro-arousals that may not substantially reduce total recorded sleep time but worsen subjective restorativeness. Given that PSQI is heavily influenced by subjective sleep quality, latency, disturbances, and daytime dysfunction, the elevated affective symptoms and arousal-related signals (higher resting HR, trait anxiety) raise reasonable expectation of a higher (worse) PSQI despite objectively sufficient duration and regularity.

Conclusion about PSQI group:
Objective sleep metrics favor placement in the lower (better) half of the PSQI distribution, but the participant’s strong internalizing symptom profile (high CES-D and STAI), modest physiological arousal, and alcohol use increase the likelihood of reporting poorer sleep quality. On balance—because PSQI scoring relies substantially on subjective experience and daytime dysfunction, and because depressive and anxiety symptoms in this dataset show the largest positive correlations with PSQI—the overall pattern is more consistent with relatively poorer PSQI scores (i.e., placement in the top half of the study distribution).

31175,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Self-report measures indicate a mixed psychological profile with modest elevations in stress and trait anxiety alongside otherwise normative affective symptoms. The participant’s CES-D score (12) is below typical clinical cutoffs and near the study mean (Z = -0.14), while trait anxiety (STAI = 40; Z = -0.13) and perceived stress (Score = 24; Z = 0.65) are somewhat elevated relative to the sample. Self-reported current happiness is below average (Z = -0.53). These affective features have small-to-moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (stress r ≈ 0.2; anxiety r ≈ 0.4 for trait anxiety), suggesting that the participant’s modestly increased stress and anxiety could contribute to worse subjective sleep quality even if depressive symptom severity is low.

Wearable-derived circadian features show a largely consolidated 24-hour cardiac rhythm but with reduced overall amplitude and lower mesor relative to the sample. Interdaily stability is near the sample mean (Value = 0.39, Z = -0.16) and intradaily variability is lower than most participants (Value = 0.30, Z = -1.73), consistent with relatively low rhythm fragmentation from day to day. MESOR and amplitude are both below average (MESOR Z = -1.28; Amplitude Z = -0.81), and the acrophase around mid-to-late afternoon (≈ 3:34 PM) is typical for daytime-peak activity. Resting heart rate is modestly low (57.8 bpm, Z = -0.04), and hourly aggregated deviations show a clear nocturnal dip of ~9–12 bpm during early morning hours and predictable daytime elevations. Overall, these heart-rate based rhythms indicate a coherent circadian pattern with lower-than-average daytime cardiac tone, which would typically be favorable for sleep consolidation.

Sleep timing and quantity present a mixed picture of long average sleep opportunity combined with pronounced night-to-night variability. Median nightly sleep duration measured by the Fitbit is very long (9 hours 34 minutes, Z = 2.96), and mean sleep start time is around 23:17 with modest variability (start-time SD ~84 minutes, Z ≈ 0.03). However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration is extremely high (SD = 249 minutes, Z = 3.37), indicating large fluctuations in total sleep obtained across the recording period. Intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythm is low (suggesting consolidated within-day activity/rest patterns), but the large swings in nightly sleep length imply irregular sleep opportunity or occasional very short/very long nights. The sleep-duration SD has a modest positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.2), meaning that greater variability is associated with worse self-reported sleep quality in this sample.

Integrative interpretation and PSQI implication: objective physiology and behavior show strengths (coherent circadian pattern, strong nocturnal heart-rate dip, frequent exercise, low resting heart rate) that are generally supportive of good sleep. In contrast, two features argue toward poorer sleep quality: (1) very large night-to-night variability in sleep duration (extremely high Z), and (2) modestly elevated stress/anxiety and lower subjective happiness, both of which are associated with higher PSQI scores in the sample. The participant’s very long median sleep might reflect compensatory sleep or extended time in bed rather than uniformly restorative sleep; combined with large variability, this pattern is more commonly associated with elevated subjective sleep disturbance than with consistently good sleep. Considering the relative magnitudes, the extreme Z-scores for sleep duration variability (Z ≈ 3.37) and the modest positive associations between stress/anxiety and PSQI tilt the balance toward a relatively poorer PSQI outcome compared with the study population.

Conclusion: based on the balance of wearable and self-report evidence—specifically the very large night-to-night sleep duration variability together with modestly elevated stress/anxiety despite otherwise coherent circadian physiology—the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of the study population PSQI distribution.

58793,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant presents a mixed psychological profile characterized by low-to-moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) alongside elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46, Z = 0.46). Self-esteem is somewhat below the sample mean (RSES = 33, Z = -0.73), whereas satisfaction with physical health is relatively high (Health Satisfaction = 6/7, Z = 1.30). Behavioral lifestyle indicators emphasize regular social engagement and frequent exercise: socializing is substantially above average (3–4 hours, Z = 1.74) and both solitary and group exercise are reported three or more times per week (Z ≈ 1.1–1.2). Alcohol use (wine/liquor 1–2×/week, Z = 0.94) is somewhat elevated relative to peers, but use of recreational or non-prescribed drugs is absent. Taken together, the profile suggests active health behaviors and social routines that often support sleep consolidation, counterbalanced by an anxiety-prone trait that is correlated positively with worse PSQI in the sample (STAI–PSQI correlation ≈ 0.40).

Sleep timing, duration, and subjective indicators:
Objectively recorded sleep quantities are notably long: median nightly sleep duration is 9 hours 2 minutes (Z = 2.3), well above the study mean. Bedtime is moderate (median sleep start ≈ 23:14), with sleep-onset timing variability somewhat elevated (start time SD ≈ 104 minutes, Z = 0.46). Night-to-night duration variability is near the sample mean (duration SD = 94 minutes, Z ≈ -0.15). Napping is negligible (mean daily naps 0.07, Z ≈ 0). The wearable-based long median sleep duration, combined with minimal napping, indicates substantial nocturnal sleep opportunity rather than reliance on daytime sleep. Correlations reported between sleep duration and PSQI are small (≈ 0.06), suggesting duration alone is not a strong predictor of PSQI in this sample, but the quantity observed here would not typically indicate poor sleep quality by itself.

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological metrics:
Heart-rate–based circadian structure appears pronounced and generally well-organized. Cosinor-derived amplitude (13.9, Z = 1.0) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.45, Z = 1.06) are elevated, indicating a large day–night difference and reliable day-to-day rhythm. Interdaily stability is near average (0.42, Z = 0.09) while intradaily variability is modestly elevated (0.61, Z = 0.46), which may reflect somewhat greater within-day fragmentation of activity or autonomic state. The participant’s MESOR (mean circadian heart rate) is above average (79.6 bpm, Z = 0.77) while estimated resting heart rate is typical (58.7 bpm, Z = 0.07). Hourly aggregate deviations show a strong nocturnal heart-rate nadir (e.g., −20 to −24 bpm from mesor across 2–6 AM) and unusually large positive deviations in the morning (notably +30.3 at 8–9 AM, Z = 3.52) and mid-afternoon (4–5 PM +22.3, Z = 2.0). The deep nocturnal decline suggests restorative physiological downregulation overnight; the pronounced morning spike could reflect intense morning activity or arousal (exercise, commute, or stress-related activation), which does not by itself indicate poor nocturnal physiology but does show a robust circadian rise.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality:
Objective indicators—particularly long median sleep duration, strong circadian amplitude and day-to-day consistency, deep nocturnal heart-rate decline, low napping, regular exercise, and good perceived physical health—collectively favor relatively good or at least non-impaired sleep physiology. Counterbalancing factors that could degrade subjective sleep quality include elevated trait anxiety (STAI) and somewhat elevated intradaily variability, and modest alcohol use; these have small-to-moderate correlations with worse PSQI in the sample (anxiety and depressive symptom correlations with PSQI are among the larger associations reported). Reported variability in sleep onset timing (SD ≈ 104 minutes) could occasionally disrupt sleep continuity for some nights. Overall, the multi-modal pattern is more indicative of preserved physiological sleep opportunity and circadian organization with some psychological risk (anxiety) that might influence perceived sleep quality on occasion.

PSQI group judgment:
Weighing objective wearable markers (long nocturnal sleep, strong circadian amplitude and regularity, healthy nocturnal HR reduction), health behaviors (regular exercise, low napping), and psychosocial risk (elevated trait anxiety but low depressive symptoms), the preponderance of evidence points to sleep quality that is at least average and more likely to fall in the lower half of the population distribution of PSQI scores (i.e., better/average sleep rather than comparatively poor sleep). Therefore the participant is more consistent with the bottom 50% of the PSQI distribution.

96689,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports low depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) but elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56). Self-esteem is slightly above average (RSES score 39, Z = 0.11), while momentary happiness and perceived health satisfaction are relatively low (happiness Z = -0.53; health satisfaction Z = -1.61). Behavioral risk factors relevant to sleep include minimal physical activity (exercise reported as “not at all”, Zs ~ -1.6 to -1.9) and no use of alcohol or recreational/nonprescribed drugs. The pattern of survey measures suggests a generally low affective burden from depression but a modest elevation in chronic anxiety and lower perceived physical health that could contribute to sleep-related concerns in some contexts.

Self-reported and wearable sleep behaviors:
Objective sleep metrics indicate habitual nightly sleep duration close to normative values for this sample (median sleep duration 7 h 18 min; Z = 0.14) and very low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD = 38 minutes, Z = -1.42; sleep start time SD = 29 minutes, Z = -1.19). The participant typically initiates sleep late in the night (median sleep start ≈ 01:55), indicating an evening chronotype or delayed sleep timing. Napping is absent (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). The combination of adequate total sleep time, low variability, and consistent sleep timing supports stable sleep opportunity and consolidation despite the late sleep onset.

Circadian and cardiac physiology:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a pronounced and regular day–night structure. Amplitude is relatively large (Amplitude Z = 1.36) and mesor is within the sample mean range (Z = 0.52), indicating a strong diurnal range in cardiovascular activity. Interdaily stability and 24-hour autocorrelation are above average (Z = 0.75 and Z = 0.98), consistent with regular daily timing of activity and physiology. Hourly aggregate deviations show marked nocturnal heart-rate suppression (approx. -20 to -25 bpm below mesor across ~2:00–7:00 AM) and clear daytime/evening elevations, including pronounced positive deviations across late afternoon and early evening (notably 6–9 PM). Resting heart rate is relatively low (58.8 bpm). Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z = 0.74), which could reflect more abrupt transitions between rest and activity within days, but the overall circadian profile is robust and shows strong nocturnal downregulation—an objective sign often associated with physiologically restorative sleep.

Synthesis and implications for sleep quality (PSQI):
Multiple converging indicators point toward overall sleep quality that is at least average and possibly relatively good within this sample. Objective strengths include adequate median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability in both duration and start time, absence of naps and substance use, a strong diurnal amplitude and clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir, and high interdaily stability—each of which tends to associate with better sleep continuity and regularity. Offsetting factors that could worsen subjective sleep quality include a late habitual sleep onset (~1:55 AM), elevated trait anxiety (which correlates moderately with worse PSQI in this dataset), low levels of exercise, and lower health satisfaction. Taken together, the balance of evidence favors relatively preserved sleep duration and regularity with some psychosocial and timing features that could increase subjective complaints for this individual, but these do not outweigh the objective indicators of circadian robustness and stable sleep patterns.

Overall PSQI group assignment:
Considering the combination of objective sleep adequacy and regularity, strong circadian amplitude and nocturnal cardiovascular downregulation, low depressive symptoms, and the absence of substance use or naps—versus the mitigating influences of late sleep timing, modestly elevated trait anxiety, and low exercise—the preponderance of evidence indicates that this participant is more likely to fall in the lower (better) half of the study population’s PSQI distribution.

The participant reports a modestly elevated level of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16; Z ≈ 0.28) while endorsing relatively low trait anxiety (STAI = 37; Z ≈ -0.43), above-average self-esteem and happiness (self‑esteem Z ≈ 0.4; happiness Z ≈ 0.55), and lower-than-average perceived stress (stress Z ≈ -0.44). Health satisfaction is slightly above the sample mean (Z ≈ 0.22). Alcohol use is at a light-to-moderate level (beer and wine 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent, and exercise frequency is low-to-moderate (exercising alone 1–2x/week; Z ≈ 0.32). The participant reports a high level of sedentary hobby time (more than 4 hours; Z ≈ 3.19), moderate internet use (2–3 hours; Z ≈ 0.85), and limited engagement in other recreational activities. Taken together, the psychological profile mixes protective indicators (low anxiety, moderate happiness and self-esteem, low stress) with a notable signal of depressive symptoms and sedentary behavior that could influence sleep regulation and daytime functioning.

Behavioral sleep characteristics (self-report and wearable):
Objective sleep duration is close to the sample average (median 7 h 5 min; Z ≈ -0.13) and night-to-night variability in total sleep time is relatively low (SD ≈ 63 min; Z ≈ -0.85). However, the participant’s habitual sleep onset is late (median sleep start ~01:42 AM) with moderate variability in sleep timing (start-time SD ≈ 64 min; Z ≈ -0.42). Napping is more frequent than typical in the sample (mean daily naps 0.26; Z ≈ 2.23), a behavior that is modestly associated with poorer PSQI in this dataset (correlation ≈ 0.18). The combination of a late bedtime and increased daytime napping suggests a delayed or shifted sleep pattern that may limit alignment between sleep timing and daytime obligations.

Circadian and physiological patterns from wearables:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show lower interdaily stability (value 0.35; Z ≈ -0.49) and relatively elevated intradaily variability (value 0.65; Z ≈ 0.74), indicating reduced day-to-day regularity and greater within-day fragmentation of physiological rhythms. The cosinor MESOR (63.24, Z ≈ -1.46) and amplitude (7.12, Z ≈ -1.18) are lower than the study mean, while acrophase is centered in the mid-afternoon (~3:16 PM). Hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced nocturnal heart-rate reductions and a strong mid-morning peak (notably +23.67 at 10–11am, Z ≈ 2.71). Collectively these features point to a dampened overall circadian amplitude with irregular timing and fragmentation rather than a robust, high-amplitude regular rhythm. Reduced circadian stability and higher fragmentation are theoretically and empirically linked to worse subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction; in this dataset the strongest physiological–PSQI associations are small-to-moderate, but the pattern of low stability and high intradaily variability is consistent with disrupted circadian organization.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
Objective sleep duration is adequate on average and several psychosocial indicators (low trait anxiety, lower stress, higher subjective happiness/self‑esteem) are protective for sleep quality. Offsetting these protections are a cluster of features associated with poorer sleep: modestly elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D) which have the highest correlation with PSQI in this dataset (r ≈ 0.49), late habitual sleep onset (~1:42 AM), increased daytime napping (Z ≈ 2.23), and wearable-derived signals of reduced interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability. Heart-rate nocturnal deviations that are more pronounced than average also show small positive correlations with PSQI in this sample. On balance, the data indicate that while total sleep time is near-average, the participant exhibits behavioral (late timing, frequent naps) and physiological (circadian fragmentation, reduced stability) patterns that commonly accompany worse subjective sleep quality, and a depressive symptom burden that is the strongest single survey correlate of poorer PSQI in this cohort.

Overall PSQI group classification:
Weighing protective factors (adequate sleep duration, low anxiety, low stress, positive affect/self-esteem) against risk indicators (elevated depressive symptoms with strong PSQI correlation, late sleep timing, frequent naps, and circadian irregularity), the preponderance of evidence suggests relatively poorer subjective sleep quality compared with the study sample. Given the moderate-to-strong association between depressive symptoms and PSQI and the presence of circadian and behavioral markers of disrupted sleep timing, the participant is more consistent with the upper half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively worse sleep quality).

36117,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report profile is mixed but contains several protective features. Positive indicators include elevated self-esteem (RSES z ≈ +0.96), above-average happiness (z ≈ +1.64), high interpersonal trust (z ≈ +1.79), and a strong academic record (GPAs in the mid-3.4–3.8 range). Trait anxiety is below the sample mean (STAI z ≈ −0.33), and substance and non-prescribed drug use are minimal. At the same time, the CES-D score (16) indicates the presence of elevated depressive symptoms relative to population norms; this measure also shows the largest positive correlation with PSQI in the provided correlations (r ≈ 0.49), so it is a salient risk factor for worse subjective sleep. Daily routines show extensive socializing and internet use (both highly above sample medians, z > +2) and large amounts of sedentary hobby time (z ≈ +3.19), which likely contribute to late-evening stimulation and less opportunity for active evening wind-down.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns:
Wearable-derived circadian metrics indicate a well-structured, regular rhythm. Interdaily stability is elevated (value 0.55, z ≈ +1.16), intradaily variability is low (z ≈ −1.94), and 24-hour autocorrelation is above average (z ≈ +1.23), collectively reflecting consistent day-to-day timing and relatively consolidated activity/rest episodes. Cosinor parameters show an elevated MESOR (mean level of heart rate; 88.9, z ≈ +2.04) and an above-average amplitude (z ≈ +1.58), with acrophase in the early evening (~5:06 PM). Resting heart rate is also higher than most peers (72 bpm, z ≈ +1.65). The hourly aggregate deviations conform to a clear nocturnal trough (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM) and afternoon/evening peaks (largest positive deviations ~3–8 PM). Taken together, the heart-rate profile implies a strong and regular circadian signal but with an overall elevated cardiac level, which can index higher physiological load or fitness-independent baseline autonomic tone.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Objective sleep metrics from the wearable show adequate duration but late timing. Median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 39 minutes (z ≈ +0.58), which is within or slightly above the sample mean and typically sufficient by normative standards. Night-to-night variability in duration is moderate (SD ≈ 93 minutes, z ≈ −0.18), indicating neither extreme regularity nor high inconsistency in total sleep time. However, the typical sleep start time is late (median ~1:13 AM) with moderate variability in bedtime (SD ≈ 100 minutes). Reported naps are essentially absent. These data indicate the participant maintains a relatively stable sleep quantity and consolidated nocturnal sleep but shifted toward a late circadian phase, likely reflecting evening social and digital activity patterns described in surveys.

Integrated interpretation relative to sleep quality (PSQI):
Evidence pointing toward relatively good or average sleep quality includes objectively adequate and fairly consistent nightly sleep duration, high interdaily stability and low intradaily variability (signs of consolidated, regular circadian timing), and minimal napping. These objective strengths tend to associate with lower PSQI (better sleep). Countervailing evidence for poorer subjective sleep centres on elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 16), late habitual sleep timing (median start ~1:13 AM), and behavioral markers of evening stimulation (excessive internet use, prolonged socializing, and sedentary evening hobbies). The CES-D shows the strongest positive correlation with PSQI in the dataset (r ≈ 0.49), suggesting depressive symptom burden is the single most important psychosocial predictor here of worse PSQI. Cardiovascular indicators (elevated resting HR and MESOR) may modestly relate to poorer sleep (small positive correlations), but those associations are weaker than the CES-D link.

Overall PSQI group assignment:
Balancing objective and subjective signals, the wearable-derived sleep duration and solid circadian regularity weigh in favor of average-to-good sleep quality, while elevated depressive symptoms and late sleep timing provide risk for worse subjective sleep. Given the relatively strong objective evidence of adequate, regular sleep and only a moderate elevation on depressive symptoms (CES-D z ≈ +0.28) rather than extreme values, the net probative balance favors placement in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., better or average sleep quality compared with the sample). Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom 50% of PSQI scores (relative to the study population).

92515,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant endorses low depressive and trait-anxiety symptoms (CES-D = 4, Z = -0.97; STAI = 36, Z = -0.52) with relatively high momentary happiness (score = 5.0, Z = 1.64) and above-average trust (Z = 0.83). Self-esteem is slightly elevated (RSES Z = 0.4). Perceived stress is lower-than-average (Z = -0.71). Academic performance is high (multiple 4.0 GPAs). Alcohol use is present but moderate (wine/liquor ~1–2x/week, Z = 0.94) and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent. Exercise occurs more often in social settings than alone (exercising with others and sports ~1–2x/week, Zs ~0.5–0.9). Overall, the self-report pattern indicates relatively favorable affective and social functioning, low symptom burden, and modest health-related behaviors that could support sleep quality from a psychosocial standpoint.

Circadian and physiological summary (wearable-derived): Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a generally regular circadian signal with modest strength: interdaily stability is near average (0.42, Z = 0.09) and autocorrelation at 24 h is relatively high (0.41, Z = 0.73), suggesting day-to-day consistency in the heart-rate rhythm. Intradaily variability is low (0.53, Z = -0.11), consistent with limited fragmentation of the heart-rate rhythm across the day. MESOR and amplitude are slightly below the cohort mean (MESOR = 72.24 bpm, Z = -0.23; amplitude = 9.67, Z = -0.36), and the acrophase around mid-late afternoon (≈4:43 PM) reflects a typical daytime peak. Resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, Z = -0.26), and the aggregated hourly deviations show a pronounced nocturnal decline in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~3–8 AM) and daytime elevations (largest positive deviations ~12–3 PM). Taken together, these physiological patterns point to a coherent, stable circadian cardiac rhythm with clear nocturnal dipping and daytime activation, suggesting intact autonomic modulation and physiological recovery during the night.

Objective sleep pattern and behavioral timing: Nightly sleep metrics derived from the wearable show a median sleep duration of roughly 5 hours 55 minutes (Z = -1.58), with a substantial tendency toward late sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 02:57 AM) and moderate night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 110 minutes, Z = 0.59). The participant takes very few naps (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07). Sleep-duration variability (SD ≈ 94 minutes, Z = -0.16) is not extreme, but the combination of consistently late sleep onset and an objectively short median duration indicates limited total nocturnal sleep opportunity. These objective sleep characteristics—short nightly duration and late, somewhat variable bedtimes—are commonly associated with reduced subjective sleep quality and functional impairment even when daytime mood and functioning are relatively preserved.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality (PSQI implications): The participant's low affective symptom burden, low intradaily fragmentation, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dipping, and consistent day-to-day circadian pattern are features that would tend to protect or support sleep quality. However, the objectively short median sleep duration (≈6 hours, Z = -1.58) and habitual very late sleep onset (median start near 3:00 AM with above-average variability) are salient risk factors for poorer sleep quality on PSQI domains (sleep duration, sleep latency/timing, and sleep efficiency). Moderate evening alcohol use could also contribute to fragmented or shortened sleep despite low self-reported distress. On balance, the physiological and circadian coherence mitigates some risk, but the magnitude of objective short sleep and late timing is substantial relative to the study sample and is likely to produce elevated PSQI scores. Therefore, synthesizing self-report and wearable evidence, the participant is more likely to fall in the worse-sleep half of the study distribution.

49790,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report measures indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and positive psychosocial resources. The participant scores very low on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, z ≈ -1.07) and on trait anxiety (STAI = 27, z ≈ -1.41), and reports above-average self-esteem and health satisfaction (RSES z ≈ +1.1; health satisfaction z ≈ +1.22). Stress is slightly elevated relative to the sample (score = 23, z ≈ +0.38) but not extreme. Substance use is limited (no recreational drugs; beer rarely; wine about 1–2×/week) and exercise is modest (exercising alone and with others 1–2×/week). Together these self-report data point toward a generally favorable psychological profile and health-related behaviors that, in isolation, would be expected to support at least average subjective sleep quality.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability: Wearable-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of about 8 hours 4 minutes (z ≈ +1.1), indicating that total sleep time is longer than the study mean. However, the median sleep start time is very late (≈ 02:18), and the standard deviation of sleep start is large (169 minutes, z ≈ +1.89), indicating substantial night-to-night variability in timing. Daytime napping is essentially absent. Thus, although total sleep quantity is adequate on average, the participant has a consistently late and highly variable sleep schedule — a pattern that can impair circadian alignment and next-day functioning despite preserved duration.

Circadian and physiological signals: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a pattern of low day-to-day regularity and a blunted daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is low (0.25, z ≈ -1.32) and autocorrelation at 24 h is low (0.14, z ≈ -1.54), consistent with irregular daily structure. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is below average (z ≈ -0.97) while MESOR and resting heart rate are elevated (MESOR 88.8, z ≈ +2.03; resting HR 75.7 bpm, z ≈ +2.09). Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected nocturnal decrease in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM), but relatively elevated evening and late-night deviations (positive around 11 PM–1 AM). Elevated MESOR and resting HR together with low amplitude and low interdaily stability suggest higher tonic physiological arousal and weaker circadian consolidation across days.

Integrated interpretation and implications for sleep quality: The participant presents a mixed multimodal picture. Protective factors for subjective sleep quality include low depressive and anxiety symptoms, adequate total sleep time, limited substance use, and minimal napping. Countervailing risk factors are a very late and highly variable sleep timing profile and objective markers of circadian irregularity and elevated physiological arousal (high resting HR, high MESOR, low interdaily stability, and lower rhythm amplitude). Empirically, variability in sleep timing and circadian irregularity are reliably associated with poorer subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction in student samples; the participant’s high bedtime variability (z ≈ +1.89) and low interdaily stability (z ≈ -1.32) are notable in that regard.

PSQI grouping decision (holistic): Evidence supporting relatively good or average PSQI (bottom half) — adequate average sleep duration, low depressive and anxiety symptoms, low substance use, and no naps — argues for at least average subjective sleep. Evidence supporting poorer PSQI (top half) — very late median sleep onset, large night-to-night variability in sleep timing, low circadian stability, blunted amplitude, and elevated resting heart rate — are features commonly linked to worse PSQI domain scores (sleep latency, disturbances, daytime dysfunction). Balancing these factors, the magnitude of timing irregularity and the large z-scores for circadian/physiological markers (resting HR and MESOR both ≈ +2.1; sleep-start variability z ≈ +1.89) indicate meaningful risk for impaired subjective sleep quality despite preserved total duration. On balance, the multimodal evidence favors classification in the top 50% of PSQI scores (relatively poorer sleep quality).

78657,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and trait-level profile: On self-report inventories the participant shows relatively low affective symptom burden and adaptive psychosocial traits. Depressive symptom scores (CES-D = 12, Z = -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) are slightly below the study mean, and self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11). Reported perceived stress is lower than the sample average (Stress Z = -1.26). Those features are generally associated with lower risk for sleep disturbance in this cohort (CES-D and STAI have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample), so the participant’s affective profile is broadly protective against severe subjective sleep problems. Conversely, low self-rated health satisfaction (2.22, Z = -1.53) and somewhat reduced current happiness (Z = -0.53) represent psychosocial signals that—although modestly correlated with PSQI in the sample—could contribute to a less favorable sleep experience for this individual.

Sleep timing, duration, and regularity (wearable + self-report): Wearable-derived sleep timing and duration are the most salient markers raising concern for sleep quality. Median nightly sleep duration is 6 hours 30 minutes (Z = -0.85), below the sample mean, and night-to-night duration is moderately variable (SD = 117 minutes, Z = 0.36). The median sleep start time is very late (03:38:30) and sleep onset timing is highly variable (start-time SD Z = 0.88). Interdaily stability of circadian heart-rate patterns is reduced (0.31, Z = -0.82) while intradaily variability is elevated (0.67, Z = 0.88), indicating irregular and fragmented rest–activity organization across days. Collectively, short average sleep, late and inconsistent bedtimes, and circadian fragmentation are behavioral patterns frequently associated with degraded subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction, even when mood symptoms are low.

Physiological and daily arousal signals: The heart-rate circadian summary shows a typical nocturnal trough with the largest negative deviations from mesor during the early morning (approx. -20 bpm around 6–8am) and elevations in the evening (peaks ~+20 bpm around 7–8pm). Resting heart rate is relatively low (53.4 bpm, Z = -0.56), consistent with good cardiovascular fitness. Mesor and amplitude are near or slightly below the sample means. The pattern of pronounced evening increases in heart rate combined with late sleep onset supports an interpretation of elevated physiological arousal in the evening and consolidated autonomic downregulation by morning; this temporal profile can make initiating sleep earlier more difficult and is consistent with the observed late sleep timing.

Lifestyle behaviors and their likely impact on sleep: The participant reports frequent exercise (≥ three times per week; exercise Z-scores > +1), which is generally associated with better sleep and may mitigate some adverse effects of short sleep. Alcohol is consumed at a weekly level (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ +1), a frequency that modestly correlates with worse PSQI in the sample. Recreational drug use is reported as none, and naps are rare (mean daily naps = 0, Z = -0.86). Recreational screen- and audio-based activities (video games, music listening) are above average in duration and could contribute to evening arousal or late sleep timing for some individuals, although their sample-level correlations with PSQI are small.

Holistic assessment regarding PSQI distribution placement: Balancing the available evidence, protective psychological factors (low depressive and anxiety scores, low perceived stress) and frequent exercise argue toward better subjective sleep. However, the participant demonstrates behavioral and physiological patterns strongly associated with poorer sleep quality: late median sleep onset (~03:40 AM), below-average nightly duration (≈6.5 hours), high night-to-night variability, reduced interdaily stability and increased intradaily variability in circadian heart-rate measures, and evening physiological arousal. These timing and regularity indicators are well-established contributors to worse subjective sleep outcomes and are likely to increase PSQI scores in this cohort. Given the relative magnitude and coherence of the timing/regularity markers (larger Z-scores for start-time variability and intradaily variability) and the direct relevance of sleep timing and duration to PSQI components, the overall pattern is more consistent with a PSQI in the higher (worse) half of the study distribution.

48154,5.0,0.1806282722513089,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant’s self-report measures describe a generally positive psychological profile. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 3, Z = -1.07) and trait anxiety (STAI = 30, Z = -1.12) are well below the sample mean, indicating low levels of reported depressive and anxious symptomatology. Self-esteem and momentary happiness are relatively high (Rosenberg self-esteem Z = 1.66; happiness Z = 1.64), and reported stress is near or slightly below average (stress Z = -0.17). Health satisfaction is above average (Z = 0.47). Substance use is low-to-moderate (infrequent beer and wine use; non-prescribed drugs not used), and exercise frequency is high when performed alone (three times a week or more, Z = 1.07). Taken together, these trait and lifestyle indicators would commonly be associated with more favorable subjective sleep outcomes rather than with pervasive sleep complaints.

Sleep timing and quantity (wearable + self-report):
Wearable-derived sleep measures indicate long and relatively consistent nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 3 minutes (Z = 1.08), and night-to-night variability in duration is modest (SD = 64 minutes, Z = -0.85), suggesting more sleep time and less variability than the average participant. Mean daily naps are essentially zero (Z = -0.86). The median sleep start time is late (01:03), with moderate night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD = 72 minutes, Z = -0.24). In sum, the participant obtains substantial total sleep time on most nights but typically goes to bed late; they do not appear to compensate with daytime napping.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology (wearable):
Heart-rate based circadian features show a relatively low-amplitude and lower-than-average interdaily regularity. MESOR and amplitude are below the cohort mean (MESOR 68.26 bpm, Z = -0.78; amplitude 8.57, Z = -0.71), and interdaily stability of the heart rate rhythm is low (value 0.26, Z = -1.23), indicating less consistent day-to-day heart rate patterning. Intradaily variability is near average (0.56, Z ≈ 0.1). Resting heart rate is relatively low (56 bpm, Z = -0.26). Hourly aggregate deviations from the MESOR show the expected nocturnal trough (large negative deviations through the early morning hours, e.g., -13 to -16 bpm between ~4–7 AM) and an evening peak in cardiovascular activity (largest positive deviation around 5–6 PM, +18.24 bpm). Physiologically, this pattern is consistent with quiet nocturnal cardiovascular states and a single consolidated nocturnal sleep episode, but the low interdaily stability and reduced amplitude suggest the participant’s circadian expression in heart rate is muted and shows less day-to-day regularity than many peers.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
The combined data paint a largely favorable sleep profile with some mixed features. Positive markers for good sleep quality include low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem and happiness, consistent and relatively long nocturnal sleep (median >8 hours), low nap use, and regular duration (low SD). These features are associated in the dataset with better PSQI outcomes (e.g., CES-D and STAI correlations with PSQI are positive, whereas self-esteem and happiness are negatively correlated). Offsetting considerations are the late average sleep onset (~1:03 AM), lower interdaily stability and lower circadian amplitude in heart rate, and heart-rate rhythmicity that is less regular across days. Late timing and reduced circadian robustness can, in some contexts, relate to subjective difficulties with sleep timing, daytime functioning, or sleep quality; however, in this participant those circadian markers coexist with substantial total sleep time, low symptom burden, and stable sleep duration.

Overall assessment of PSQI position:
Weighing the objective and subjective evidence holistically, the preponderance of indicators points toward relatively good or at least average sleep quality in the context of this study sample. Low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high well-being, above-average total sleep time with low variability, no napping, and low substance use are all consistent with a lower PSQI score (better sleep). The main countervailing signals—late sleep timing and reduced heart-rate interdaily stability/amplitude—are notable but appear insufficient given the stronger evidence for restorative nocturnal sleep and favorable psychological functioning. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study PSQI distribution (i.e., lower/ better PSQI scores).

21793,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Wearable-derived sleep and circadian features indicate a pattern of short, late, and irregular nocturnal sleep in this participant. Median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 9 minutes (Z = -1.29), placing the participant well below the study mean for sleep length. Sleep onset timing is markedly delayed with a median start time near 03:36 AM and substantial night-to-night variability (sleep start SD Z = 1.04), consistent with an irregular sleep schedule. The participant also logged an elevated frequency of naps (mean daily naps Z = 3.05), which together with short nocturnal sleep suggests fragmented or redistributed sleep across the 24-hour day. Within-night heart-rate deviations show relatively elevated cardiovascular activity in the early night hours (positive deviations around 12–3 AM; largest Z-scores at 2–3 AM) and large negative deviations in the early morning (3–7 AM), a pattern compatible with delayed sleep timing and distinct nighttime physiology; these hourly deviations should be interpreted relative to the participant’s resting heart rate (resting HR 54.2 bpm, Z = -0.47).

Circadian-summary metrics from cosinor and nonparametric analyses further support reduced circadian regularity and amplitude. Interdaily stability is low (0.17; Z = -1.98), indicating weak day-to-day consistency in the heart-rate rhythm, while intradaily variability is elevated (0.68; Z = 0.95), indicating greater fragmentation of activity within days. Amplitude and mesor are both below population averages (amplitude Z = -1.38; mesor Z = -1.13), suggesting a damped circadian amplitude in heart-rate signals. Autocorrelation at 24 hours is also reduced (Z = -1.45), reinforcing the interpretation of a less stable, lower-amplitude 24-hour physiological rhythm.

Self-report and behavioral measures provide convergent information that would be expected to relate to poorer sleep quality. Perceived stress is elevated (Stress score Z = 1.47), and trait anxiety is above average (STAI Z = 0.17); both measures correlate positively with PSQI in the sample and are known correlates of disturbed sleep. Depression symptoms are near but slightly below common clinical cutpoints (CES-D = 15; Z = 0.18), and self-reported happiness and trust are below average (happiness Z = -0.53; trust Z = -0.46). Physical activity appears modest (exercise alone 1–2×/week, Z = 0.32) and sedentary/leisure patterns include high listening-to-music time (Z = 1.6) and above-average TV/video engagement (Z = 0.64), which may reflect evening leisure that can be associated with later bedtimes. Alcohol and recreational drug use are low to occasional and unlikely to fully account for the sleep pattern observed.

Integration and interpretation with regards to sleep quality: multiple independent indicators point toward relatively poorer sleep quality in this participant. Objective indicators—short median sleep duration, late median sleep onset with high variability, frequent daytime napping, low interdaily stability, and damped circadian amplitude—are all consistent with disrupted or insufficient nocturnal sleep and irregular rhythms, which are empirically linked to higher PSQI scores in this cohort. Elevated perceived stress and modest elevations in trait anxiety lend further support to poorer subjective sleep. Correlations provided in the dataset (stress PSQI r ≈ 0.19; intraday variability and sleep variability metrics with small positive correlations) align with this interpretation, though none of the correlations alone determine group placement.

Given the preponderance of evidence from wearable measures (short sleep, late and variable sleep timing, high nap frequency, low interdaily stability) combined with elevated stress and some anxiety, the balance of information indicates this participant is more likely to have a relatively poor PSQI score compared with the study distribution. Therefore, the participant is most consistent with placement in the top half of the study population with respect to PSQI (i.e., relatively worse sleep quality).

37218,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report profile indicates elevated mood and anxiety symptoms alongside low subjective well-being. CES-D score of 24 (Z = 1.11; classification: “Depressed”) and STAI–Trait = 49 (Z = 0.76; “anxious”) point to a substantial level of depressive and trait-anxious symptoms; both scales have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), which links these symptoms to worse sleep in this cohort. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, Z = -1.29) and current happiness and health satisfaction are below the sample mean (happiness Z = -1.61; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.95), each of which is inversely associated with sleep quality in the population correlations. Behavioral factors that could sustain late-night schedules or arousal include very high music listening ("">4 hours"", Z = 2.06) and above-average socializing (3–4 hours, Z = 1.74), while formal exercise is minimal (essentially no exercise; exercise Z-scores strongly negative). Alcohol and other substance use are essentially absent. Overall, the self-report pattern is consistent with elevated internalizing symptoms, low restorative lifestyle behaviors (low exercise), and leisure patterns that could extend evening activation.

Sleep timing and duration:
Wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate a markedly delayed sleep schedule and relatively short nightly sleep. Median sleep start time is 03:56:30 (about 4:00 AM), and median sleep duration is 6 hours 1 minute (Z = -1.45), indicating shorter than typical sleep duration in the study population. Night-to-night variability in sleep timing and duration is moderate but not extreme (sleep start SD ≈ 74 minutes, duration SD ≈ 91 minutes; Z-scores ~ -0.2). The participant reports no habitual naps. The combination of very late sleep onset and curtailed nocturnal sleep implies a pattern of circadian delay and/or chronic insufficient time in bed, both of which are commonly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality.

Physiological circadian and nocturnal arousal markers:
Cardiovascular circadian features from heart rate suggest some regularity in daily structure but a blunted amplitude and signs of elevated late-night physiological arousal. Interdaily stability is slightly above average (0.48, Z = 0.58), indicating relatively consistent day-to-day timing (likely consistently late). Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is reduced (8.83, Z = -0.63), suggesting a less pronounced day–night heart rate difference. The mesor and resting heart rate are modestly above sample means (Mesor 76.13 bpm Z = 0.30; resting HR 61 bpm Z = 0.34). Aggregated hourly deviations show elevated heart rate relative to the mesor during late evening and around midnight (notably 11–12pm +10.39, 12–1am +6.97, 1–2am +4.03; corresponding Z-scores elevated at those hours), with expected large negative deviations across early morning sleep hours (e.g., -16 to -21 bpm around 4–7am). The late-night positive deviations and modestly blunted amplitude together suggest higher physiological arousal in the late evening/night period despite consistent late sleep timing. Small-to-moderate positive correlations between nocturnal hourly deviations (especially 2–4am) and PSQI (r ≈ 0.20–0.22) in the sample further support that late-night autonomic activation is associated with worse reported sleep quality.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality (PSQI):
Multiple converging indicators point toward relatively poor sleep quality for this participant. Objective wearable data show a very delayed sleep schedule and shortened sleep duration (median ≈ 6 h, Z = -1.45) coupled with late-night elevations in heart rate and reduced circadian amplitude—physiological patterns commonly linked to fragmented or non-restorative sleep. Self-report measures show elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (both positively correlated with PSQI in the cohort) and low well-being and limited exercise, which are additional psychosocial risk factors for worse sleep. While interdaily stability is slightly higher—suggesting a consistent pattern rather than erratic timing—this consistency appears to be anchored to a late, short sleep schedule rather than to an earlier, restorative schedule. On balance, the weight of behavioral, subjective, and physiological evidence indicates that this participant’s overall sleep quality is more consistent with the upper half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep) in the study population.

Self-esteem and health satisfaction are above average (SelfEsteem Z = 0.82; Health Satisfaction Z = 0.97), and perceived stress is lower than average (Stress Z = -0.98). The participant also reports frequent exercise (exercised alone three or more times per week, Z = 1.07) and no daytime napping (Mean Daily Naps Z = -0.86). Alcohol use is present at a moderate, weekly level (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 1.0), and recreational/non-prescribed drug use is absent.

Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show marked negative deviations overnight (largest negative values between ~2:00–7:00 AM) and positive deviations through the afternoon and early evening, with an acrophase around 5:12 PM; this pattern is typical of consolidated nighttime rest and higher daytime arousal.

Objective sleep timing and duration: Nightly sleep metrics indicate long and fairly regular sleep. Median sleep duration is 8 hours 35 minutes (Z = 1.74), placing the participant well above the sample median for total sleep time. Sleep start time is relatively late (median ~1:23 AM) but has modest variability (start time SD = 53 minutes, Z = -0.66). Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is near average (SD 94 minutes, Z = -0.16). The absence of daily naps and the strong nocturnal heart-rate trough lend support to the Fitbit-derived nights being consolidated sleep episodes rather than fragmented rest. Taken together, these findings indicate a consistent but late sleep schedule with above-average total sleep opportunity.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI): Multiple converging signals point toward relatively good or at least not poor sleep quality for this participant. Strong interdaily regularity, low intradaily variability, long median nightly sleep, no daytime napping, low depressive and anxiety symptom scores, low perceived stress, and a low resting heart rate are all features that, in this sample, tend to associate with lower PSQI scores (better sleep). Potential risks for poorer subjective sleep—moderate weekly alcohol use and a late bedtime combined with elevated evening-oriented recreational screen time—are present but appear not to have translated into shorter or more irregular sleep in the recorded interval. Correlations between individual measures and PSQI in the sample are generally modest; however, the participant’s profile consistently aligns with markers that correlate with better sleep (e.g., high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, low depressive/anxiety scores, long consolidated sleep). On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., relatively good/average sleep quality).

81420,8.0,0.7591623036649214,"The self-report profile indicates elevated internalizing symptoms alongside some markers of adaptive behavior. Depressive symptomatology is relatively high (CES-D = 25, Z = 1.22; instrument classification: “Depressed”), and trait anxiety is also above the sample mean (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86). Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES = 31, Z = -1.01). These affective measures have nontrivial positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40; SelfEsteem r ≈ -0.35), indicating that the participant’s elevated depressive and anxious symptoms and lower self-esteem are plausibly linked to worse subjective sleep quality. Stress is modestly elevated (score 23, Z ≈ 0.38) and general satisfaction with physical health is low (health satisfaction Z ≈ -1.11), which together provide additional psychosocial context that tends to align with higher PSQI scores in the study population.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular metrics show a profile of relatively preserved nocturnal heart rate suppression but reduced amplitude and modest irregularity across days. Resting heart rate is slightly above average (62.6 bpm, Z = 0.53) and the MESOR is elevated (78.34, Z = 0.6). The cosinor amplitude is below average (amplitude Z = -0.74), suggesting a blunted day–night heart rate range. Interdaily stability is low (0.29, Z = -0.99), indicating weaker day-to-day regularity of the heart rate rhythm, while intradaily variability is also unusually low (0.31, Z = -1.66), consistent with relatively low fragmentation of activity within days. The acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:52 PM) and the hourly deviations (large negative deviations across early morning hours and positive deviations in mid-afternoon) are consistent with a circadian profile in which physiological arousal falls substantially overnight and rises into the afternoon/evening, but with a compressed amplitude. Overall these features suggest physiological arousal cycles that are present but of reduced amplitude and with weaker stability across days, a pattern that can be associated with circadian misalignment and increased likelihood of perceived sleep problems.

Sleep timing and quantity reveal a delayed habitual schedule with average total duration. Median nightly sleep duration is within the normative range for this sample (7 h 12 min, Z = 0.02), and napping is uncommon (mean daily naps ≈ 0.07). However, the median sleep start time is late (≈ 02:40 AM) and night-to-night variability in sleep start is substantial (SD ≈ 93 minutes), indicating a late and somewhat irregular sleep timing pattern. Sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 87 minutes) is moderate. The combination of late timing, reduced interdaily stability, and measurable variability in sleep timing are factors that frequently contribute to poorer subjective sleep quality and daytime impairment despite adequate aggregate sleep time; in the present dataset, timing variability and late onset have small positive correlations with PSQI (sleep start SD r ≈ 0.18; duration SD r ≈ 0.20).

Behavioral context offers mixed influences on sleep. The participant exercises regularly (exercising alone three or more times per week; exercise Z ≈ 1.07), which is generally protective for sleep, and has low recreational drug use. Alcohol use is present at a modest weekly level (beer 1–2×/week, Z ≈ 1.01), which can negatively affect sleep continuity even if total duration remains adequate. Daily social and recreational habits (1–2 hours socializing, modest screen and media time) do not suggest extreme evening screen exposure, but the late sleep timing suggests either evening activities or chronobiological preference driving sleep timing. The overall behavioral footprint therefore contains both sleep-supportive elements (regular exercise, low naps) and risk factors for poorer subjective sleep (late schedule, moderate alcohol use, elevated mood/anxiety symptoms).

Weighing the evidence for PSQI placement: indicators supportive of relatively good/average PSQI include objectively adequate median sleep duration (≈7 h 12 m), low napping, and regular exercise; these features would tend to lower PSQI scores. Countervailing evidence favoring poorer PSQI includes elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (strongest psychosocial correlates with PSQI in the sample), late habitual sleep timing (median start ≈ 2:40 AM) with substantial night-to-night timing variability, low interdaily stability of circadian measures, modestly elevated resting HR and MESOR, and weekly alcohol use. Given the relatively strong association of depressive symptoms with worse PSQI in this cohort (CES-D r ≈ 0.49) together with the circadian/timing irregularities (late and variable sleep timing and low interdaily stability), the preponderance of risk-relevant features suggests the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of the PSQI distribution.

67709,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and self-report profile: The participant reports elevated depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 29; Z = +1.63) and moderately elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z = +0.46), alongside higher-than-average perceived stress (Z = +1.19). Self-esteem is below the sample mean (RSES Z = -0.73). Together, these affective indicators point to a heightened internal burden during the semester; relevant correlations in the study show depressive symptoms and trait anxiety have the strongest positive associations with poorer PSQI scores (CES-D r ≈ 0.50; STAI r ≈ 0.40). At the same time, the participant reports relatively low substance use and reasonable physical-health satisfaction, which may afford some protective effects, but the overall psychological profile favors risk for subjectively poorer sleep.

Sleep timing and duration (self-report + wearable): Wearable-derived median nightly sleep duration is relatively long at 8 hours 16 minutes (Z = +1.34), but night-to-night duration is highly variable (SD ≈ 173 minutes; Z = +1.65). Bedtime timing is markedly delayed, with a median sleep start time near 03:45 AM and moderate night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 98 minutes; Z = +0.33). The combination of a very late sleep schedule and large variability in both duration and timing suggests irregular sleep opportunity: while aggregate duration is long, the inconsistency and delayed phase are features commonly associated with reports of poorer sleep quality and daytime dysfunction (and nightly variability here correlates positively with PSQI, r ≈ 0.20).

Circadian and heart-rate physiology: Circadian summary metrics indicate a relatively low mesor (mean heart rate; 67.9 bpm, Z = -0.83) and a modest amplitude (11.6, Z = +0.27). Interdaily stability is slightly below the sample mean (0.38, Z = -0.24) and the 24-hour autocorrelation is notably low (0.19, Z = -1.12), indicating weaker day-to-day regularity of heart-rate rhythms across the recording period. Intradaily variability is lower than average (0.46, Z = -0.60), suggesting limited high-frequency fragmentation of the rhythm, but the low autocorrelation and the late median sleep time together support the interpretation of an irregular schedule rather than well-entrained, stable timing.

Hourly cardiovascular pattern and physiological arousal: Aggregated hourly deviations from the participant’s mesor show expected nocturnal declines (largest negative deviations across the early morning hours) but strikingly large positive deviations in the evening, most prominently a very large elevation at 5–6 PM (deviation +29.45, Z = +2.76) and sustained elevations into late evening (10–11 PM deviation +13.37, Z = +1.09). There is relatively little morning heart-rate elevation. This pattern is consistent with concentrated physiological activation in the late afternoon/evening and elevated autonomic arousal late in the evening, which could contribute to delayed sleep onset and subjective sleep difficulties despite long overall sleep time.

Behavioral context and likely contributors to sleep quality: Behavioral measures show minimal alcohol or recreational drug use (Z-scores strongly negative), frequent exercise with others (Z ≈ +1.23), and sustained leisure use of the internet and music (internet Z ≈ +1.52, music Z ≈ +1.13). Elevated evening physiological arousal combined with high evening/night leisure screen and audio use and a markedly delayed sleep schedule suggests a behavioral milieu that supports late sleep timing and irregular sleep opportunity. The high depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress amplify the risk that sleep is experienced as poor even when cumulative duration is long.

Integrated interpretation and PSQI grouping: Weighing the multimodal evidence, there are multiple converging signals associated with poorer subjective sleep quality: elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (strongly correlated with PSQI in this sample), high night-to-night variability in sleep duration and delayed/irregular bedtimes, low day-to-day circadian regularity (low 24-hr autocorrelation), and pronounced evening physiological arousal. Protective signs (long median sleep duration, low substance use, regular group exercise) are present but are counterbalanced by the magnitude of affective symptoms and the degree of timing irregularity. Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates the participant is more likely to fall in the higher-PSQI (worse sleep quality) half of the study population.

36552,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Sleep behavior and objective sleep metrics: The participant’s wearable-derived sleep profile indicates relatively short nocturnal sleep and a late, consistent sleep timing. Median nightly sleep duration was 6 hours 23 minutes (Z = -1.00 versus the study sample), which places total sleep time below the study median and likely below normative recommendations for young adults. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration was low (SD = 49 minutes, Z = -1.17) and sleep start times were consistently late (median start 01:28:30 AM) with relatively low variability in sleep onset (SD Z = -0.75). The participant did not take recorded naps (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Taken together, these data describe a stable but late sleep schedule with shorter-than-average nocturnal sleep.

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology: Heart-rate based circadian features show reduced amplitude and reduced day-to-day rhythm stability alongside elevated within-day fragmentation. Amplitude (7.46) is lower than the cohort average (Z = -1.07), and interdaily stability is low (0.29, Z = -0.99), while intradaily variability is elevated (0.72, Z = 1.23). These patterns indicate a circadian rhythm that has weaker day–night contrast and greater fragmentation within days. The fitted cosinor acrophase at about 4:02 PM and an aggregated hourly profile with large daytime peaks (notably a 3–4 PM deviation of +19.9 bpm, Z = 1.99) and substantial nighttime troughs (largest negative deviations ~ -12 to -14 bpm between 2:00–6:00 AM) are consistent with a discernible daytime autonomic activation and deep nocturnal heart-rate suppression. Resting heart rate is somewhat elevated relative to the sample (64.3 bpm, Z = 0.73). Overall, the circadian/physiological signature suggests preserved day–night heart-rate cycling but with reduced amplitude and poorer day-to-day regularity, and modestly elevated cardiovascular arousal at baseline.

Psychological traits and lifestyle behaviors relevant to sleep: Self-report measures show modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 44, Z = 0.27) and perceived stress (score 24, Z = 0.65), with depressive symptoms low-to-moderate (CES-D = 10, Z = -0.34) and self-esteem at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26). Health satisfaction is above average (score 5, Z = 0.55). The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times/week or more, Z = 1.07) and minimal substance or recreational drug use. Daily recreational patterns show moderate screen time (TV/internet ~31 minutes per hour) and limited socializing. These psychosocial and behavioral features present a mixed picture: protective behaviors (regular exercise, low substance use, high self-esteem, no naps) coexist with higher stress/anxiety and evening-oriented activity patterns that may be compatible with late bedtimes.

Integrated interpretation for sleep quality (PSQI-relevant inference): Several convergent indicators suggest a propensity toward poorer sleep quality. The objectively shorter median sleep duration and delayed sleep timing increase risk for sleep-related complaints and daytime dysfunction. Reduced circadian amplitude, low interdaily stability and elevated intradaily variability point to a weakened and more fragmented circadian organization—features that are commonly associated with impaired subjective sleep quality. Elevated resting heart rate and modestly higher stress/anxiety provide additional physiological and psychological context that typically correlate with worse sleep. Offsetting factors that could mitigate poor PSQI scores include regularity of night-to-night timing (low sleep start SD), frequent exercise, low substance use, and good self-rated health and self-esteem; however, these appear insufficient to fully counterbalance the combination of late, short sleep and circadian fragmentation. The pattern of associations and the magnitudes of z-scores (notably negative amplitude and interdaily stability and positive intradaily variability and resting HR) collectively indicate greater likelihood of elevated PSQI scores compared with the study median.

PSQI group assignment: Considering the balance of objective wearable metrics (short sleep, late timing, low amplitude, low interdaily stability, high intradaily variability, elevated resting HR) together with psychosocial correlates (higher stress/anxiety), the overall evidence favors placement in the worse-sleep half of the sample distribution (higher PSQI score, top 50%).

16654,6.0,0.387434554973822,"The self-report data indicate a psychological profile that generally favors healthy sleep. The participant reports negligible depressive symptoms (CES-D = 0, Z = -1.38) and below-average trait anxiety (STAI = 34, Z = -0.72). Self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z = 0.11) and satisfaction with physical health is elevated (Health Satisfaction Z = 1.3). Stress and happiness scores are near or slightly below the cohort mean (Stress Z = -0.44; Happy Z = -0.53), and academic performance is strong. Leisure and social habits show frequent socializing (2–3 hours daily, Z = 0.95) and regular exercise including group activity (exercising with others three times a week or more, Z = 1.23). Alcohol use is moderate (beer/wine/liquor 1–2 times/week), with no recreational or non-prescribed drug use reported. Collectively, these trait and lifestyle indicators are most consistent with adequate sleep-promoting psychosocial conditions rather than clear risk for poor sleep.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian metrics support the inference of physiologically consolidated and regular sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 46 minutes (Z = 0.73), placing total sleep time above the cohort median. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively low (SD = 55 minutes, Z = -1.04), and sleep start time is consistent across days (start time SD = 30 minutes, Z = -1.17). The participant records essentially no naps. Circadian measures derived from heart rate show above-average interdaily stability (0.54, Z = 1.08) and a relatively high amplitude in the cosinor fit (15.22, Z = 1.44), indicating a robust and regular daily rhythm. Resting heart rate is normal-to-low (59.7 bpm, Z = 0.18), and the aggregated hourly heart rate deviations show a clear nocturnal trough (largest deviations ≈ -20 to -25 bpm between ~3–7 AM) and elevated daytime deviations peaking in early afternoon—together consistent with good nocturnal physiological downregulation and daytime activation.

Integrating subjective and objective data yields a coherent behavioral-physiological picture: the participant obtains adequate total sleep time with low variability and displays stable, high-amplitude circadian organization and clear nocturnal cardiovascular quiescence—features that are typically associated with better sleep quality. The principal countervailing feature is the late habitual sleep timing (median sleep start ≈ 1:37 AM). A late schedule can be associated with poorer subjective sleep quality or social/chronobiological misalignment in some contexts; however, here the low variability in timing, absence of naps, robust amplitude and interdaily stability, and favorable psychosocial profile reduce the likelihood that late timing alone produces high global PSQI scores. Correlations provided in the dataset between several of these metrics and PSQI are small and do not outweigh the convergent evidence for consolidated, regular sleep.

Weighing all evidence—objective sleep duration above average, low night-to-night variability, strong circadian regularity and amplitude, clear nocturnal heart rate decline, low depressive and anxious symptoms, and generally health-promoting behaviors—the balance favors relatively good overall sleep quality compared with the study sample. Although the late sleep onset is a noteworthy caveat, the preponderance of multimodal indicators suggests the participant would fall in the lower (better) half of the PSQI distribution.

29134,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"Psychological and lifestyle profile: Self-report data indicate broadly favorable psychological functioning and health-related behaviors. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 12, Z ≈ -0.14) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z ≈ -0.33) are below the sample mean and classified as not depressed / not anxious. Self-esteem is high (RSES = 39, Z ≈ 0.11), and reports of happiness and health satisfaction are above average (happiness Z ≈ 0.55; health satisfaction Z ≈ 0.55). The participant reports regular, frequent exercise (team/with others and sports reported three times per week or more; Z-scores 1.23 and 1.58), low recreational drug use, and modest alcohol consumption (beer and wine 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 0.9–1.0). These survey indicators—especially low affective symptoms, high activity levels, and positive health satisfaction—are typically associated with more favorable subjective sleep and daytime functioning in student samples.

Sleep timing and variability: Wearable-derived sleep statistics reveal a pattern of relatively late but sufficiently long nocturnal sleep combined with high night-to-night variability. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 40 minutes (Z = 0.6), indicating longer-than-average sleep quantity. However, variability in sleep duration (SD = 159 minutes, Z = 1.33) and especially variability in sleep start time (SD = 183 minutes, Z = 2.20) are substantially elevated relative to the study sample. The median sleep start time itself is late (approximately 01:13 AM). Elevated variability in timing and duration is a salient feature because greater irregularity is associated here with higher PSQI scores (positive correlations around 0.16–0.19) and can increase subjective sleep fragmentation and daytime dysfunction despite adequate average duration.

Circadian and heart-rate derived measures: Circadian summaries from heart-rate cosinor and non-parametric features show a generally regular but lower-amplitude rhythm. Interdaily stability (0.41) is at the sample mean (Z = 0.0), suggesting reasonable day-to-day regularity in the heart-rate rhythm overall. Intradaily variability is slightly lower than average (Z ≈ -0.18), which reflects modestly reduced fragmentation during the day. MESOR and amplitude are both somewhat below the sample means (MESOR Z ≈ -0.56; amplitude Z ≈ -0.51), indicating a lower average heart-rate level and a reduced peak-to-trough range across the day; lower amplitude showed a small negative correlation with sleep quality in the sample. Resting heart rate is relatively low (55.4 bpm, Z ≈ -0.33), consistent with fitness and fewer autonomic arousal-related sleep complaints. Hourly aggregated deviations show the expected large reductions in heart rate overnight (largest negative deviations around 3–6 AM) and afternoon/evening positive deviations; there is no evidence of atypical nocturnal elevations in heart rate that would indicate frequent nocturnal arousal.

Integration and interpretation for sleep quality: The participant presents a mixed profile for predictors of PSQI-measured sleep quality. Objective and behavioral indicators supportive of better or average sleep include above-average median nightly duration (≈7 h 40 m), low resting heart rate, frequent exercise, and favorable affective functioning. These elements would predict a PSQI in the lower half of the sample distribution (better sleep). Conversely, pronounced irregularity in sleep timing and substantial night-to-night variability in duration—both with elevated Z-scores and positive correlations with PSQI in the sample—are risk factors for worse subjective sleep quality and daytime impairment. Circadian amplitude is also modestly reduced, another factor that can relate to lower sleep consolidation. Weighing these signals, the impact of very large variability in sleep timing is notable, but it co-occurs with otherwise strong protective features (sufficient mean sleep time, robust daytime functioning, high physical activity, and low resting heart rate). On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports relatively good to average sleep quality overall rather than poor sleep quality.

24029,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports elevated affective and stress-related symptoms alongside low self-esteem. CES-D (score = 21, Z = 0.8) and trait anxiety (STAI = 50, Z = 0.86) are above the study mean and both show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.5, STAI r ≈ 0.4), indicating that higher depressive and anxiety symptoms are linked to worse subjective sleep in this cohort. Perceived stress is markedly high (score = 30, Z = 2.28), which also tends to relate to sleep complaints (r ≈ 0.2). Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 29, Z = −1.29), a variable that correlates negatively with poor sleep (r ≈ −0.36), so its low value here is consistent with vulnerability to worse subjective sleep. Health behaviors include regular exercise (frequent solitary and group exercise and sports; Z-scores > 1), minimal substance and drug use, and generally good academic performance. However, the participant reports relatively high engagement with screen- and audio-based leisure (video games Z = 2.47; listening to music Z = 2.06; sedentary hobbies Z = 2.01), which can be contemporaneous with evening wakefulness or arousal and has the potential to affect sleep timing or perceived sleep quality.

Subjective and wearable sleep measures:
Objective sleep duration is modestly below the study mean: median nightly sleep is 6 h 46 min (Z ≈ −0.52). Night-to-night variability in duration (SD ≈ 102 min, Z ≈ 0.02) and sleep start time variability (SD ≈ 99 min, Z ≈ 0.36) are near the sample average, indicating some inconsistency but not extreme instability. The median sleep start time (~22:45) is not unusually late. The participant reports essentially no regular napping (mean daily naps = 0, Z ≈ −0.86). Taken together, wearable sleep metrics indicate slightly short but not severely curtailed nocturnal sleep and modest variability; however, objective measures alone are only weakly correlated with PSQI in the sample (sleep duration r ≈ 0.05), so they may underrepresent subjective sleep disturbance.

Circadian and physiological patterns:
Heart rate–derived circadian features are largely within or close to the sample mean: mesor ≈ 72.9 bpm (Z ≈ −0.15) and amplitude ≈ 11.5 (Z ≈ 0.23), with an acrophase around mid-afternoon (≈ 2:19 PM), consistent with a typical daytime activity peak. Resting heart rate is relatively low (54.6 bpm, Z ≈ −0.42), suggesting good cardiovascular fitness. Nonparametric rhythm metrics show some fragmentation: intradaily variability is moderately elevated (IV = 0.7, Z ≈ 1.09), while interdaily stability is near average (0.42, Z ≈ 0.09). The hourly aggregated deviations from the mesor reveal a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate trough (large negative deviations around midnight–3 AM) followed by a very steep morning rise (notably 6–7 AM deviation Z ≈ 4.77). This pattern indicates a clear night-day cardiovascular separation and a consistent morning activation, but elevated intradaily variability implies more abrupt or frequent transitions between rest and activity within days. These circadian characteristics produce a physiologically salient day–night contrast but also some within-day instability that can be experienced as fragmented or irregular activity and potentially relate to sleep complaints.

Integrated interpretation with respect to sleep quality (PSQI):
Objective sleep metrics (slightly short sleep duration, modest variability, clear nocturnal heart-rate trough and robust morning rise) do not, by themselves, strongly indicate severe sleep disturbance; several physiological markers (low resting heart rate, clear circadian amplitude) are consistent with generally consolidated nocturnal rest. However, the participant’s elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and particularly high perceived stress are each moderately associated with worse PSQI scores in the sample, and these psychosocial factors often drive subjective reports of poor sleep quality. Additionally, behavioral factors—high evening-oriented leisure (video games, prolonged music listening) and increased intradaily variability—are plausible contributors to perceived or transient sleep problems. Because PSQI is a subjective index and correlates fairly strongly with mood measures in this cohort (especially CES-D and STAI), the balance of evidence (psychological distress + some behavioral patterns consistent with evening activation, despite only modest objective sleep deficits) favors the participant reporting worse-than-average sleep quality. On that basis, the participant is more likely to fall in the higher (worse) half of the PSQI distribution in this study.

35361,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The self-report battery indicates generally low affective symptom burden and favorable psychosocial functioning. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7; Z = -0.66) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38; Z = -0.33) are both below the study mean, and self-esteem is at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40; Z = 0.26). Self-rated happiness and health satisfaction are above average (happiness Z = 0.55; health satisfaction Z = 0.55). The participant reports little to no use of alcohol or recreational/non-prescribed drugs and engages in regular exercise (exercising alone three times/week or more; Z = 1.07). Together, these survey-based indicators point toward a profile of relatively low psychological distress, positive self-evaluation, and health-promoting behaviors that are typically associated with better sleep quality.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular patterns:
Fitbit-derived circadian metrics show clear and relatively robust daily organization. Interdaily stability (0.59; Z = 1.49) is high, indicating consistent day-to-day timing of the heart rate rhythm, while intradaily variability (0.37; Z = -1.24) is low, indicating low within-day fragmentation of the rhythm. Cosinor-derived amplitude is moderately elevated (13.48; Z = 0.87) with an acrophase in the late afternoon (around 4:28 PM), and mesor is slightly below average (67.8 bpm; Z = -0.84). Resting heart rate is low (49.8 bpm; Z = -0.99), consistent with cardiovascular fitness. Hourly aggregate deviations from the mesor show pronounced nocturnal decreases (largest negative deviations between ~2:00–6:00 AM) and daytime elevations centered in the early-to-mid afternoon (peaking roughly 11 AM–3 PM). Overall, these physiological patterns denote a well-entrained circadian profile with clear day-night separation and low rhythm fragmentation—features that generally support efficient sleep.

Sleep timing and duration:
Device-recorded sleep shows a median nightly duration just under seven hours (6 h 56 min; Z = -0.31) with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ~61 min; Z = -0.91), and a median sleep start time near 00:57 (about 1:00 AM) with a standard deviation of ~73 minutes (Z = -0.21). Napping is essentially absent (mean daily naps = 0; Z = -0.86). These indicators suggest relatively consistent sleep timing and limited compensatory daytime sleep, although the typical sleep onset is somewhat late relative to conventional earlier bedtimes. The modestly shorter-than-7-hour median sleep could be relevant if chronic, but variability is not elevated and nocturnal physiological quiescence (heart rate reductions at night) is strong.

Integration and implications for sleep quality (PSQI):
Multiple converging signals point toward relatively good-to-average sleep quality in this participant. Protective factors include low depressive and anxiety symptomatology, regular exercise, minimal substance use, high interdaily stability and low intradaily variability of heart-rate rhythms, low resting heart rate, and consistent night-to-night sleep timing with virtually no napping. The primary potential concern is a habitual late sleep onset (~1:00 AM) with median nightly sleep just under seven hours, which could reduce total sleep opportunity if morning obligations demand earlier rising; however, there is no evidence here of high sleep fragmentation or large variability that would commonly accompany poor PSQI scores. Correlations between the provided metrics and PSQI in this dataset are small in magnitude and do not indicate large risk factors present for poor sleep quality.

PSQI group classification:
Weighing the behavioral, self-report, and wearable-derived physiological evidence together, the balance favors relatively good-to-average sleep quality compared with the study sample (i.e., a PSQI in the lower half of the distribution). The consistency of circadian rhythms, low psychological symptom burden, health-supporting behaviors, and limited night-to-night variability outweigh the modestly late sleep timing and slightly short median duration.

Academic performance is strong (GPAs in the high 3s), and general health satisfaction is modestly below the sample mean. Stress is slightly elevated relative to peers (score = 23, Z = 0.38) but not extreme. Social engagement and sedentary leisure (socializing 2–3 hours daily; elevated sedentary hobby time) are notable, while regular exercise is conspicuously low (exercise indices substantially below the sample mean). Alcohol consumption is moderate (wine/liquor 1–2 times/week); recreational and non-prescribed drug use are absent. Taken together, the psychological profile is largely protective with low mood/anxiety liability, but lifestyle features—low physical activity and relatively sedentary leisure—represent potential contributors to less-robust sleep regulation.

Observed sleep habits (self-report + wearable): Sleep timing is markedly delayed, with a median sleep start time at approximately 02:19 AM. Despite the late sleep onset, median nightly sleep duration is about 7 hours 18 minutes (Z = 0.15), indicating that total sleep time is, on median, within a normative or slightly favorable range. However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively high (SD ≈ 107 minutes, Z = 0.13) and sleep onset timing is moderately variable (start time SD ≈ 78 minutes). Daytime napping is negligible. These patterns suggest a late chronotype with adequate total sleep on many nights but with substantial variability across nights, which can contribute to inconsistent subjective sleep quality and daytime functioning even when average duration appears sufficient.

Physiological and circadian indicators from heart rate: Resting heart rate is low-to-average for the sample (≈56.3 bpm, Z = -0.22; MESOR ~69.5 bpm, Z = -0.61) and circadian amplitude of heart rate is reduced relative to the cohort (amplitude ≈9.0, Z = -0.57), while interdaily stability and intradaily variability are close to the sample mean (both small negative Zs). The cosinor acrophase at ~5:43 PM is within an evening/afternoon range, and autocorrelation at 24 h is modestly positive (Z = 0.39), indicating some day-to-day regularity. Hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show an unexpected relative elevation around midnight (12–1 AM deviation +9.8, Z = 1.66) followed by pronounced negative deviations during the core sleep window (roughly 2–7 AM), consistent with lower nocturnal heart rate during sleep. The midnight elevation in heart rate relative to the mesor may reflect physiological arousal or activity proximate to the participant’s late bedtime, aligning with the late sleep onset observed in the sleep statistics.

Integrated interpretation and implications for sleep quality: The strongest sleep-promoting signals in the multimodal data are very low depressive and anxiety symptoms, adequate median sleep duration, minimal daytime napping, and a relatively low resting heart rate — each of which is generally associated with better subjective sleep. Countervailing signals include a markedly delayed sleep schedule (median start ~02:20 AM), substantial night-to-night variability in sleep duration and timing, low levels of exercise, reduced circadian amplitude, and an elevated midnight heart-rate deviation suggesting physiological activation at or near the delayed bedtime. These latter features are commonly associated with increased sleep fragmentation, longer sleep latency, or worse subjective sleep quality in some individuals. Correlations provided in the dataset indicate only modest relationships between many of these measures and PSQI in the broader sample; here, the low mood/anxiety and sufficient median sleep duration likely exert stronger influence than the late timing and variability. On balance, the totality of evidence points toward generally adequate or average sleep quality rather than pronounced disturbance: the participant appears to obtain sufficient median sleep and does not show the psychological risk profile that typically accompanies high PSQI scores, although the delayed, irregular schedule and low physical activity may pose vulnerabilities for periodic or domain-specific sleep problems (e.g., sleep latency, daytime dysfunction).

95490,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological profile: The participant reports modest levels of affective symptoms and stress that are plausibly relevant to sleep. CES-D score (14) is near the sample mean (Z = 0.07) and is classified as not depressed, but the CES-D has a relatively strong positive correlation with PSQI in this sample (r = 0.49), indicating that even subclinical depressive symptoms are informative for sleep disturbance risk. Trait anxiety (STAI = 47, Z = 0.56) is elevated relative to peers and is also positively correlated with PSQI (r = 0.40), suggesting a meaningful relationship between anxiety proneness and poorer sleep in this cohort. Self-esteem and current happiness are below the sample mean (RSES Z = -0.59; happiness Z = -0.53) and stress is modestly elevated (Z = 0.38); these psychosocial features together point toward increased vulnerability to sleep disruption even though no categorical mood disorder is indicated.

Behavioral and lifestyle factors: The participant engages in regular solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07), which is a protective behavior for sleep, and reports minimal napping (mean daily naps 0.07, Z = -0.08). Alcohol use is moderate (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z ≈ 1.0), which can acutely and cumulatively degrade sleep continuity for some individuals. Socializing and listening to music are above average (socializing Z = 0.95; music Z = 0.67), while many sedentary hobbies and internet use are in the mid-range. Overall, the behavioral profile shows both protective elements (regular exercise, low napping) and risk elements (weekly alcohol, high social/evening activity) that could influence sleep timing and continuity.

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiovascular markers: Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate reduced rhythm regularity and reduced amplitude. Interdaily stability (value 0.23, Z = -1.48) and autocorrelation at 24 hours (value 0.19, Z = -1.12) are low, consistent with an irregular day-to-day schedule. Amplitude is lower than average (8.34, Z = -0.79), while MESOR and resting heart rate are slightly above average (MESOR Z = 0.43; resting HR 61.4 bpm, Z = 0.39). Intradaily variability is mildly elevated (0.60, Z = 0.39), indicating more pronounced within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology. The hourly aggregated deviations show a clear nocturnal heart-rate nadir (large negative deviations between ~1–7 AM) and a strong late-afternoon peak (notably 4–6 PM with high positive deviations), implying preserved nocturnal cardiovascular decline but a blunted overall circadian amplitude and reduced day-to-day consistency. Collectively these features suggest a physiologic profile of circadian irregularity and moderate sympathetic arousal that can be associated with poorer subjective sleep quality.

Wearable sleep statistics and sleep timing: Objective sleep quantity is close to seven hours (median 6 h 56 m, Z = -0.30), so total duration alone does not indicate pronounced short sleep. However, sleep timing is late and inconsistent: median sleep start is about 01:11 AM with a large night-to-night start-time standard deviation (~101 minutes, Z = 0.40). Nightly sleep duration variability is substantial (SD 103 minutes, Z ≈ 0.04) and correlates positively with PSQI (r = 0.20), indicating that inconsistent sleep length and timing are associated with worse sleep quality in this cohort. Low nap frequency means daytime compensation via naps is unlikely; the main timing issue appears to be late and variable bedtimes rather than chronic short total sleep time.

Integrated interpretation and implication for PSQI placement: The profile combines several signals that typically relate to poorer PSQI scores: elevated trait anxiety (STAI), modest depressive symptoms (CES-D) with strong sample-level correlations to PSQI, late and highly variable sleep timing, and objective indicators of low interdaily stability and reduced circadian amplitude. Protective factors—near-recommended median sleep duration and frequent exercise—are present but do not fully offset the risks posed by irregular timing and psychosocial stressors. Given the relatively large z-deviation for interdaily stability (≈ -1.48), elevated anxiety, and the documented relationship of timing irregularity and variable sleep duration with higher PSQI in this sample, the balance of evidence favors classification in the poorer-sleep half of the population distribution.

90079,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Sleep timing and duration patterns indicate constrained and irregular nocturnal sleep. Fitbit-derived sleep statistics show a median nightly sleep duration of 5 hours 54 minutes (Z = -1.59), substantially shorter than the study mean and below the sample median; nightly sleep timing is late, with a median sleep start near 01:53 AM and a moderately large night-to-night variability in sleep onset (SD ≈ 104 minutes, Z = 0.46). Nightly sleep duration also exhibits substantial variability (SD ≈ 138 minutes, Z = 0.84). These objective sleep features—short average duration combined with high intra-individual variability and late bedtimes—are classically associated with poorer subjective and objective sleep outcomes and are likely to contribute to higher global PSQI scores.

Circadian and cardiovascular rhythm measures further emphasize a pattern of circadian irregularity and dampened rhythmicity. Nonparametric circadian metrics show low interdaily stability (value 0.21, Z = -1.65) and elevated intradaily variability (value 0.75, Z = 1.44), consistent with weak day-to-day regularity and greater within-day fragmentation of activity/physiology. Parametric cosinor features show a reduced amplitude (6.53, Z = -1.37) with a mesor of 76.93 bpm (Z = 0.41) and a resting heart rate of 65.6 bpm (Z = 0.89). The hourly aggregate heart-rate deviations show pronounced overnight reductions relative to the mesor (largest negative deviations ~ -10 to -13 bpm between 1–5 AM) and afternoon–evening elevations (positive deviations peaking in the early evening), consistent with a preserved nocturnal dip but an overall elevated baseline (mesor and resting HR). Collectively, these circadian features (low stability, high fragmentation, and reduced amplitude) are typically related to disrupted sleep consolidation and lower sleep quality.

Self-report psychological and behavioral context provides mixed but generally non-protective information. Scores on depressive symptoms (CES-D = 14, Z ≈ 0.07) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) are near sample norms and do not strongly indicate clinical affective disturbance, while perceived stress is modestly elevated (score 24, Z = 0.65). The participant reports lower-than-average happiness and trust and slightly lower health satisfaction. Lifestyle factors that often protect sleep—low alcohol and recreational drug use and low nap frequency—are present; exercise frequency is modest (1–2 times per week). These behavioral factors may mitigate some sleep risk, but the objective short sleep duration, late and variable timing, and circadian irregularity are stronger determinants of poor sleep quality than the modest protective behaviors.

Integrating the multimodal evidence, the balance of indicators favors poorer overall sleep quality relative to the study population. The most salient contributors are objectively short median sleep (<6 hours), late and variable sleep onset, elevated night-to-night variability in sleep duration, and circadian metrics showing low interdaily stability and high intradaily variability. Although self-reports show only modest mood symptoms and minimal substance use (which can be protective), these do not outweigh the objective markers that are commonly associated with higher PSQI scores. On net, the data are most consistent with a PSQI placement in the upper half of the study distribution (i.e., comparatively poorer sleep quality).

22842,10.0,0.9136125654450262,"Participant sleep behavior as captured by the wearable shows a relatively long median nightly sleep duration (7 h 51 m; Z = 0.83) but substantial instability in timing and quantity. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is elevated (SD ≈ 133 minutes; Z = 0.73) and sleep start time is very late on average (median start ≈ 02:56 AM) with large variability (start-time SD Z = 1.79). Daytime compensatory sleep is present (mean daily naps = 0.28; Z = 2.4), consistent with fragmented or misaligned nocturnal sleep. Taken together, these features indicate that although total sleep time is often adequate, its temporal organization is irregular and shifted well into the late night/early morning, which is commonly associated with subjective sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness.

Circadian and cardiac indices further support a de-synchronized pattern. Nonparametric rhythms show low interdaily stability (0.30; Z = -0.9) and relatively low intraday variability (0.46; Z = -0.6), indicating weak day-to-day regularity of activity and a blunted pattern of within-day transitions. Parametric circadian features show reduced amplitude (8.7; Z = -0.67) and a lower MESOR (69.34 bpm; Z = -0.63), while the acrophase is late in the evening (~6:03 PM). Hourly heart-rate deviations from the mesor reveal modest elevations around midnight–2 AM and a pronounced trough through the early morning (3–7 AM), then renewed elevations in the afternoon and early evening. The overall pattern is compatible with a late chronotype and diminished circadian robustness, which can contribute to perceived poor sleep quality even when gross sleep duration appears sufficient.

Psychological trait measures indicate elevated affective symptoms that are relevant for sleep evaluation. Depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 20; Z ≈ 0.7) and trait anxiety (STAI = 46; Z ≈ 0.46) are above the cohort mean, while self-reported happiness and self-esteem are lower than average. These affective measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the study (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), implying that the participant’s elevated symptoms are likely to co-occur with poorer subjective sleep quality. Protective behavioral factors are present (regular solitary exercise frequency high; low use of alcohol and drugs; low resting heart rate), which may buffer sleep problems to some degree, but they do not fully counterbalance the combination of late timing, irregular schedules, and elevated affective symptoms.

Weighing objective and subjective indicators: evidence for relatively good or average sleep quality includes adequate median sleep duration, regular exercise, low substance use, and a comparatively low resting heart rate. Evidence favoring relatively poor sleep quality includes very late and highly variable sleep timing, frequent naps, reduced interdaily stability and circadian amplitude, and moderately elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms (which show the strongest correlations with PSQI in this dataset). On balance, the convergence of timing irregularity and affective distress—which are both known to have substantial influence on global PSQI—suggests this participant is more likely to report poorer overall sleep quality than the cohort median.

14279,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The survey data indicate a generally low affective symptom burden and a favorable cognitive-affective profile for sleep. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 5, Z = -0.86) and trait anxiety (STAI = 38, Z = -0.33) are both below the study mean, and perceived stress is also below average (Z = -0.44). Self-esteem is at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40) and academic performance is strong (GPAs consistently ≈3.75–3.85). These trait-level indicators are typically protective for sleep continuity and daytime functioning. There are modestly lower scores on self-reported happiness (Z = -0.53) and interpersonal trust (Z = -1.74), which could reflect limited interpersonal resources but are not strongly tied to the core physiological sleep metrics in this dataset.

Circadian and cardiovascular rhythm summary:
Heart rate–based circadian features show a relatively robust and regular day–night structure. Mesor and resting heart rate are near or slightly above the sample mean (Mesor ≈ 76.9 bpm, RHR 59 bpm, both small positive Z-scores), while amplitude is elevated (Amplitude Z = 1.11), indicating a pronounced day–night difference in cardiovascular activation. Interdaily stability (Z = 0.58) and 24-hour autocorrelation (Z = 0.81) are above average, suggesting reasonably consistent daily timing across the recording period. Intradaily variability is modestly elevated (Z = 0.53), which can reflect some within-day fragmentation of activity, but the overall pattern—large negative overnight deviations from mesor (around -20 bpm in the 3–6 AM window) and strong positive deviations across midday/afternoon—is consistent with consolidated nocturnal quiescence and expected daytime arousal. The circadian acrophase at approximately 4:05 PM describes a typical late-afternoon peak in heart rate.

Wearable sleep behavior and sleep timing:
Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate relatively long and generally consistent nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration is 8 hours 11 minutes (Z = 1.24), placing the participant well above the study median for duration. Median sleep start time is around 00:18 with night-to-night onset variability of about 66 minutes (Z = -0.37), and overall sleep duration variability (SD ≈ 93 min) is not elevated relative to peers (Z = -0.19). Daytime napping is negligible. Collectively, these features point to sufficient sleep opportunity and relatively stable timing—both factors typically associated with better subjective and objective sleep quality.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
Objective and self-report indicators converge toward a profile of generally good sleep health. Protective signals include long median sleep duration, consolidated overnight physiological quiescence (sustained negative heart-rate deviation at night), elevated circadian amplitude, good interdaily regularity, low symptom burden (depression/anxiety/stress), and minimal naps. Potential minor countervailing elements are modest intraday variability in activity and a somewhat late median sleep onset (shortly after midnight), plus weekly wine consumption; none of these factors appear large in magnitude or uniquely predictive of poor sleep in this dataset. Correlational guidance provided in the dataset does not indicate strong relationships that would suggest major sleep disturbance for this participant.

PSQI group assignment (top vs bottom half):
Considering the combination of above-average sleep duration (Z = 1.24), consolidated nocturnal physiology, moderate-to-high circadian regularity and amplitude, low affective symptom burden, and minimal napping, the preponderance of evidence is consistent with relatively good or at least average sleep quality compared with the study population. Although there are small indicators of within-day variability and a slightly later bedtime, these do not outweigh the larger protective signals. On balance, the participant is more likely to fall in the lower half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality, below the study median).

28327,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Psychological and self-report profile:
The participant reports markedly elevated affective symptomatology: a CES-D score of 33 (Z = 2.05) and an STAI–Trait score of 58 (Z = 1.65), indicating substantially higher depressive and trait-anxiety symptom burden relative to the study sample. Self-esteem is relatively low (RSES = 26, Z = -1.71), and single-item indices of current happiness and health satisfaction are also below sample means (happiness Z = -1.61; health satisfaction Z = -1.86). These psychological features have moderate positive correlations with higher PSQI scores in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40; self-esteem r ≈ -0.35), implying that the participant’s elevated mood and anxiety symptoms are likely to be associated with poorer subjective sleep quality even when objective sleep metrics may appear adequate.

Behavioral habits and lifestyle:
Reported lifestyle behaviors are mixed but not extreme. Alcohol use is at a modest weekly level (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times per week; Z-scores ≈ 0.9–1.0). The participant exercises infrequently (typically 1–2 times per week across solo and group activity; Z ≈ 0.3–0.9) and reports limited sedentary recreational activities (minimal TV or gaming; more time listening to music). Academic performance (GPA) is high. Napping is rare (mean daily naps ≈ 0.12, Z = 0.61). Overall, these behaviors suggest neither large protective nor strongly deleterious lifestyle effects on sleep; alcohol use is present but not heavy, and low exercise frequency could modestly contribute to subjective sleep complaints.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian physiology:
Fitbit-derived sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 7 h 37 min (Z = 0.54), relatively close to or slightly above the sample median, with moderate night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 88 minutes, Z = -0.29). Median sleep start time is late (~00:54) but with modest consistency (start-time SD ≈ 68 minutes, Z = -0.33). Heart-rate–based circadian features show a reasonably regular daily rhythm: interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.49, Z = 0.67), amplitude is relatively large (14.01, Z = 1.04), and resting heart rate is within typical bounds (60.2 bpm, Z = 0.24). Hourly aggregate deviations indicate clear nocturnal heart-rate dipping (largest negative deviations between ~2–7 AM, −16 to −21 bpm) and pronounced evening peaks (notably 6–8 PM with Z-scores >1.8–2.2). Intradaily variability is somewhat elevated (0.69, Z = 1.02), suggesting more fragmentation in activity/physiology across the day. Overall, wearables indicate objectively adequate sleep duration and a robust circadian amplitude with moderate fragmentation and a late but consistent sleep schedule.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality:
Objective wearable indicators (sufficient median sleep duration, substantial nocturnal heart-rate dipping, above-average circadian amplitude, and modest day-to-day regularity) point toward physiologically adequate sleep opportunities and circadian organization. However, the participant’s pronounced depressive and anxiety symptomatology, low self-esteem, and low subjective health/happiness are strongly associated with poorer PSQI scores in this sample and with subjective sleep complaints in general. Correlational weights in the dataset show the largest relationships with PSQI are mood and anxiety measures (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), whereas objective sleep duration and many circadian metrics show weak correlations with PSQI. Given that the PSQI is a self-report index sensitive to perceived sleep quality, the combination of high depressive and anxious symptom burden and low well-being is likely to inflate PSQI scores even in the context of reasonable objective sleep duration and nocturnal physiology.

PSQI group judgement:
Weighing the objective and subjective evidence holistically: physiological and wearable metrics are mixed-to-favorable, but the participant’s high depressive and anxiety symptoms—variables with the strongest sample correlations with PSQI—support a higher (worse) PSQI ranking relative to peers. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall into the higher PSQI group (worse sleep quality) relative to the study distribution.

52302,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report profile indicates generally low depressive symptoms (CES-D = 7; Z = -0.66) and above-average self-reported well-being (happiness Z = +0.55; self-esteem near the high end), with modest levels of trait anxiety (STAI = 43; Z = +0.17). Health and lifestyle behaviors are largely protective for sleep: minimal substance use, routine exercise (1–2 times per week alone and with others; sports participation Z ~ +0.91), and relatively high satisfaction with physical health. Social and recreational patterns show substantial evening/leisure engagement (watching videos, video games, socializing), which is consistent with later sleep timing but not necessarily with poorer sleep across other domains. Correlations included in the dataset indicate depressive symptoms and trait anxiety have the strongest positive associations with worse PSQI scores (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), but the participant’s low depressive burden offsets part of that risk; the slightly elevated anxiety represents only a moderate potential contributor to poorer subjective sleep.

Circadian and cardiovascular indicators from the wearable:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics show a coherent, moderate-amplitude rhythm (amplitude Z ≈ +0.5) with a mesor slightly below average (mesor Z ≈ -0.28) and an acrophase in the late afternoon (≈ 5:17 PM), consistent with a daytime activity peak. Resting heart rate is relatively low (52.5 bpm; Z ≈ -0.67), which typically reflects good cardiovascular fitness and is generally associated with better physiological recovery overnight. Interdaily stability is modestly below average (Z ≈ -0.33), suggesting some day-to-day variability in the timing/strength of the rhythm, while intradaily variability is relatively low (Z ≈ -0.95), indicating fewer rapid fluctuations in activity within a day. The aggregated hourly deviations show a robust nocturnal heart-rate nadir between about 2–7 AM (deviations from mesor of roughly -14 to -22 bpm), which is consistent with consolidated physiological sleep and nighttime cardiovascular quiescence; there is a smaller positive deviation around midnight–1 AM, compatible with later sleep onset/greater evening arousal in this individual. Overall, the wearable physiology portrays a generally robust circadian amplitude and healthy nocturnal cardiovascular dipping, tempered by some irregularity in daily timing.

Overnight sleep behavior and variability:
Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate a relatively long median nightly sleep duration (8 hours 6 minutes; Z ≈ +1.14), few naps (mean daily naps ~0.13; Z ≈ +0.7), and a late median sleep onset time (~01:08 AM) with moderate night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 123 minutes, sleep start SD ≈ 103 minutes; Z-scores ≈ +0.5 and +0.43 respectively). The combination of long average total sleep time and substantial variability/late timing suggests that while total nocturnal sleep quantity is ample on aggregate, the irregular and delayed timing of sleep episodes is a salient behavioral feature. The dataset’s correlations show that greater night-to-night variability in duration and timing is modestly associated with higher (worse) PSQI scores (r ≈ 0.20 and r ≈ 0.18 respectively), implying that variability and late timing could increase subjective sleep complaints even when average duration is high.

Integrated interpretation and implications for sleep quality (PSQI):
Weighing multimodal evidence, several indicators point toward relatively good physiological and restorative sleep: long median sleep duration, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate dipping, low resting heart rate, minimal depressive symptoms, low substance use, and regular exercise. Countervailing factors that can increase subjective or domain-specific sleep problems are the late median sleep onset (~1:08 AM), appreciable night-to-night variability in both duration and start time, and a modest elevation in trait anxiety. The provided variable–PSQI correlations show the strongest relationships for depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (which here are low-to-moderate), while many wearable circadian features have small or negligible correlations with PSQI in this sample. Taken holistically, the balance of evidence favors a profile of physiologically restorative sleep with behavioral timing irregularity that may produce occasional subjective complaints but not a broadly severe PSQI burden.

PSQI group classification:
Considering the participant’s strong objective indicators of restorative sleep (long median nightly duration and robust nocturnal HR nadir), generally low depression and minimal substance use, against moderate risk factors (late and somewhat irregular sleep timing, modest trait anxiety), the overall pattern is more consistent with PSQI scores at or below the population median rather than in the upper (poorer) half. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the study distribution (better/average sleep quality).

46418,11.0,0.9581151832460733,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The self-report data indicate a mixed psychological profile. The participant reports a moderately elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D = 18; Z ≈ 0.49) while trait anxiety is below the sample mean (STAI = 38; Z ≈ -0.33). Self-esteem is near the sample mean (RSES = 38; Z ≈ -0.03). Current happiness is slightly above average (self-rating = 4; Z ≈ 0.55), and reported stress is near average (22; Z ≈ 0.1). Health satisfaction is relatively low (2.67 on a 1–7 scale; Z ≈ -1.2). Lifestyle behaviors include regular social and team exercise (frequent sports and exercising with others; Z-scores 1.23–1.58), moderate weekly alcohol use (beer and wine/liquor 1–2 times/week; Z ≈ 0.9–1.0), and limited daytime napping. These characteristics suggest some affective symptom burden (notably depressive symptoms) concurrent with active social and physical routines that are typically sleep-protective.

Sleep timing and wearable sleep statistics:
Objectively-recorded sleep duration and stability are relatively favorable. Median nightly sleep duration was 7 hours 44 minutes (Z ≈ 0.69), with low night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 64 minutes, Z ≈ -0.84) and minimal daytime napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z ≈ -0.86). Sleep onset timing is late (median sleep start ≈ 01:49:45), but sleep-start variability is modest (SD ≈ 52 minutes, Z ≈ -0.68). Taken together, the participant tends to obtain an adequate total sleep amount with consistent nightly durations, but with a delayed sleep schedule (habitual late bedtimes).

Circadian and physiological indicators:
Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a well-structured rhythm. Interdaily stability is high (0.53; Z ≈ 1.0) and intradaily variability is low (0.30; Z ≈ -1.73), indicating a regular, minimally fragmented 24-hour pattern. Cosinor-derived amplitude is relatively large (15.07; Z ≈ 1.39) with a MESOR of 78.2 (Z ≈ 0.58), and the acrophase centers in the early evening (≈5:55 PM). Resting heart rate is low–normal (57.8 bpm; Z ≈ -0.04). Hourly deviations from the MESOR show clear nocturnal troughs (heart rate well below mesor overnight, reaching −19 to −23 units in the early morning) and pronounced evening elevations (large positive deviations, especially ~5–6 PM). Overall these wearable signals are consistent with a consolidated nocturnal sleep period and robust circadian organization.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
Objective wearable indicators (sufficient median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability, absence of naps, high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, and clear nocturnal heart-rate decline) point toward relatively good sleep quantity and circadian regularity. Countervailing signals that can be associated with poorer subjective sleep quality include the participant’s late habitual bedtime (median ~1:50 AM) and moderately elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D), both of which are correlated with worse PSQI in the sample (CES-D correlation with PSQI ≈ 0.49; STAI correlation ≈ 0.40). Weekly alcohol use and some evening media use (watching TV/videos 1–2 hours; Z ≈ 1.28) are additional behavioral factors that can degrade subjective sleep quality in some individuals. However, the objective profile (adequate duration, regular timing variability, stable circadian metrics) and healthful indices (frequent exercise, low resting heart rate) outweigh these risk factors in terms of expected overall sleep functioning.

Overall PSQI group assessment:
Balancing objective wearable data, behavioral patterns, and self-report affective indices, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the study’s PSQI distribution (i.e., better/average sleep quality). The participant’s objective sleep quantity and circadian regularity are more consistent with comparatively lower PSQI scores, while the main reasons for possible elevation in PSQI would be the late sleep timing and modest depressive symptoms. On balance, the combination of adequate and regular sleep recorded by the wearable, minimal naps, and strong circadian amplitude/interdaily stability suggests a PSQI more likely in the bottom 50% (better/average sleep) of the study population.

93002,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant’s self-report profile shows generally low-to-average affective symptoms with some indicators of reduced subjective well-being. Depressive symptom burden on the CES-D is near the study mean (score = 14; Z ≈ 0.07) and is classified as “not depressed,” and trait anxiety is close to average (STAI = 40; Z ≈ -0.13). Self-esteem is lower than average (RSES score = 32; Z ≈ -0.87) and current happiness and health satisfaction are below the sample mean (happiness Z ≈ -0.53; health satisfaction Z ≈ -0.78). Reported stress is only slightly above average (score = 22; Z ≈ 0.1). Substance use is minimal and academic performance (GPAs reported) is solid. Taken together, these data indicate modest reductions in subjective well-being (especially self-esteem and health satisfaction) but an overall affective profile that is not markedly elevated for depression or trait anxiety.

Daily activities and lifestyle:
Lifestyle reports indicate limited solitary exercise (1–2 times/month) but more frequent exercise with others (1–2 times/week). The participant reports little to no use of TV, video games, or sedentary hobbies, but moderate internet use (2–3 hours; Z ≈ 0.85). Socializing is present at typical levels (1–2 hours). Recreational substance use is negligible. These behaviors suggest a relatively low substance and media burden, modest social engagement, and somewhat irregular personal activity patterns (limited solo exercise, some group activity).

Sleep behavior derived from wearables and self-report:
Objective sleep metrics show a median nightly sleep duration of 6 hours 28 minutes (Z ≈ -0.88), below 7 hours and shorter than the study mean, with substantial night-to-night variability (sleep duration SD ≈ 120 minutes; Z ≈ 0.43). Median sleep onset is late at 01:16 AM with a large variability in sleep start time (SD ≈ 103 minutes; Z ≈ 0.43). Napping occurs but infrequently (mean daily naps ≈ 0.18; Z ≈ 1.21). These wearable-derived features point to a pattern of late bedtimes, shorter-than-recommended total sleep, and moderate inconsistency in timing and duration across nights—factors generally linked to decreased sleep continuity and subjective sleep quality. Correlations provided in the dataset show modest positive associations of sleep-timing variability and nap frequency with higher PSQI (worse sleep), which supports concern for less optimal sleep quality.

Circadian and physiological profile:
Heart rate-based circadian metrics reflect a relatively structured daily rhythm. Interdaily stability (value = 0.49; Z ≈ 0.67) and autocorrelation at 24 h (Z ≈ 0.81) are above average, indicating consistent day-to-day timing of cardiovascular activity across the recording period. Intradaily variability is near average (Z ≈ 0.24), and cosinor amplitude is modest (Z ≈ 0.30). Resting heart rate and mesor are both relatively low (RHR = 48.25 bpm, mesor = 64.89; Zs ≈ -1.18 and -1.24), suggesting low basal cardiovascular arousal or relatively high aerobic fitness. Aggregated hourly deviations show large negative departures from the mesor overnight (largest negative deviations between ~3–6 AM) and pronounced positive deviation in the early evening, particularly 7–8 PM (value ≈ +23.9; Z ≈ 2.16), which could reflect evening behavioral arousal or activity. Overall, the physiological record is consistent with a stable circadian timing structure and low resting autonomic tone despite the late habitual bedtime.

Synthesis and likely PSQI grouping:
Evidence relevant to PSQI is mixed but leans toward an elevated PSQI (poorer sleep quality relative to the sample). Indicators favoring a higher (worse) PSQI include objectively short median sleep duration (~6.5 hours, Z ≈ -0.88), late median sleep onset (~1:16 AM) with moderately high variability in bedtime and duration (both Z ≈ 0.43), and above-average tendency to nap (Z ≈ 1.21). Several behavioral and self-report features that modestly correlate with higher PSQI—lower self-esteem (Z ≈ -0.87), lower health satisfaction (Z ≈ -0.78), and variability in sleep timing—are present. In contrast, features that would predict relatively better PSQI include near-mean depressive and anxiety symptoms, minimal substance use, and relatively high interdaily stability and low resting heart rate (both Zs < 0), which are associated with more stable rhythms and typically lower subjective sleep disturbance. Given the stronger and more direct links between short sleep duration, late and variable sleep timing, increased napping, and poorer subjective sleep, the balance of multimodal evidence suggests this participant is more likely to fall in the top half of the study distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively poorer sleep quality).

56543,9.0,0.8507853403141361,"Psychological and trait profile: The participant reports elevated affective distress and anxiety relative to the study sample. The CES-D score is 18 (Z ≈ 0.5), above common screening cutoffs and indicating increased depressive symptom burden over the prior week; trait anxiety (STAI) is high at 50 (Z ≈ 0.9). Self-esteem is below average (Rosenberg = 33, Z ≈ −0.7) and perceived stress is elevated (score = 25, Z ≈ 0.9). At the same time, self-rated health satisfaction is relatively high (5.44 on a 1–7 scale, Z ≈ 0.9). Taken together, affective indicators (depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress) point toward greater psychological risk factors that are commonly associated with impaired sleep, while some aspects of perceived physical health are comparatively favorable.

Sleep timing and duration (wearable + self-report): Objective sleep timing from the wearable shows a markedly delayed median sleep start time of approximately 02:22 AM with a standard deviation of ~60 minutes, indicating a late and somewhat consistent sleep schedule. Median nocturnal sleep duration is about 6 hours 26 minutes (Z ≈ −0.94), shorter than the study mean and below recommended nightly sleep for most young adults. Night-to-night variability in duration is moderate but slightly lower than average (SD ≈ 71 minutes, Z ≈ −0.67), and napping is minimal (mean daily naps = 0.1). The pattern is therefore one of habitual late bedtimes with relatively constrained, but short, nocturnal sleep opportunity.

Physiological arousal and circadian structure: Heart-rate–based circadian measures show a raised central tendency (mesor ≈ 82.3 bpm, Z ≈ 1.1) and elevated resting heart rate (68 bpm, Z ≈ 1.2), suggesting higher baseline cardiovascular activation than average in this cohort. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is near the sample mean (amplitude Z ≈ 0.02), and interdaily stability is modestly higher than average (0.49, Z ≈ 0.67), indicating a reasonably consistent daily rhythm across days. Of particular note are large positive deviations from the mesor during late evening hours (notably 9–11 PM and especially 10–11 PM where deviations are pronounced, Z ≈ 5.9), implying substantial physiological arousal or activity in the late-evening window immediately before the participant’s habitual sleep onset. Overnight hourly deviations show the expected reduction in heart rate, but the late-evening spike is a salient physiological marker that can interfere with sleep onset and subjective sleep quality.

Lifestyle and behavioral contributors: The participant reports heavy internet use (>4 hours/day, Z ≈ 2.2) and substantial reading time (2–3 hours/day, Z ≈ 4.2), with low reported recreational substance use and minimal napping. Exercise frequency alone is relatively high (three times/week or more, Z ≈ 1.1). These behaviors are mixed in their likely impact: regular solitary exercise may support sleep, and low substance and nap burden reduce common disruptors; however, extensive late-day/evening screen time and the pronounced late-evening physiological activation observed in the wearable data are likely to counteract these protective elements and contribute to delayed sleep onset and reduced sleep opportunity.

Synthesis and likely impact on PSQI: Multiple converging signals predict poorer sleep quality. Elevated depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and self-reported stress are each positively associated with worse PSQI scores in the sample (correlations in the data are moderate for CES-D and STAI). Objectively, habitual late sleep timing (median start ≈ 02:22 AM), shortened nocturnal sleep (≈6 h 26 m), and a marked late-evening elevation in heart rate together indicate both behavioral and physiological barriers to sleep initiation and maintenance. Offsetting features that could favor average or good sleep—regularity across days (interdaily stability > mean), low napping, and frequent exercise—appear insufficient to counterbalance the late timing, elevated evening arousal, and affective distress. On balance, the weight of evidence favors a relatively poorer sleep profile compared with the study population.

Final classification: Given the assembled behavioral, physiological, and psychological indicators that align with poorer sleep quality (late habitual sleep onset, short nocturnal sleep duration, late-evening physiological arousal, and elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms), the participant is more consistent with the upper half of the PSQI distribution (worse sleep quality).

89142,4.0,0.06282722513089005,"Wearable-recorded sleep behavior indicates a pattern of short and late nocturnal sleep. Median nightly sleep duration was 5 hours 50 minutes (Z = -1.68), substantially shorter than the study population mean and consistent with clinically meaningful sleep restriction. Bedtimes are late on average, with a median sleep start time near 01:02 AM and moderate night-to-night variability in duration (SD = 123 minutes, Z = 0.51). Daytime compensatory sleep is minimal (mean daily naps = 0.13, Z = 0.70). Collectively, these objective sleep timing and duration metrics suggest limited opportunity for consolidated nocturnal sleep and a schedule that is shifted later than typical for the cohort.

Circadian and cardiac metrics show a robust nocturnal heart rate decline and a generally well-structured daily rhythm. The cosinor-derived MESOR and resting heart rate are low relative to the population (MESOR = 60.11, Z = -1.89; resting HR = 45.6 bpm, Z = -1.49), and hourly aggregate deviations show pronounced negative deviations overnight (largest at ~3–5 AM) and clear daytime elevations peaking in the late morning and again early evening. Nonparametric features indicate modestly above-average interdaily stability (0.45, Z = 0.33) and lower intradaily variability (0.44, Z = -0.74), consistent with a relatively regular and consolidated circadian activity profile despite the late sleep timing. In sum, physiology reflects a strong day–night contrast even though sleep timing is delayed.

Self-report and behavioral measures provide a mixed psychological context. Depressive symptoms were low–moderate (CES-D = 12, classified as not depressed; Z = -0.14), but trait anxiety is elevated (STAI = 48, Z = 0.66). Self-esteem is below average (RSES = 32, Z = -0.87) and overall health satisfaction is notably low (score = 1 on a 1–7 scale, Z = -2.45). The participant reports essentially no perceived stress on the survey (score = 0, Z = -5.88), minimal substance use, and very low engagement in exercise. Recreational behaviors include above-average time with reading and video games. Elevated trait anxiety combined with late bedtimes and short sleep duration is a pattern frequently associated with increased sleep complaints or sleep disturbance, even when objective circadian consolidation remains intact.

Integrative interpretation and implications for PSQI placement: objective indicators that typically contribute to higher PSQI scores are present — specifically restricted total sleep time (median <6 hours), late sleep onset, and notable night-to-night variability in duration. Psychological correlates that tend to co-occur with poorer subjective sleep (elevated trait anxiety, low self-esteem, low health satisfaction) are also present. Countervailing signals that might reduce perceived sleep disturbance include low self-reported stress and physiologic markers of consolidated circadian organization (low intradaily variability and clear nighttime heart rate decline). However, the magnitude of objective sleep restriction and late timing is strong and commonly elevates global PSQI scores. Considering the balance of evidence, the pattern is more consistent with relatively poorer sleep quality within this study cohort.

Conclusion — likely PSQI distribution placement: top_50 (worse sleep quality).

24898,6.0,0.387434554973822,"The self-report profile indicates a mix of risk and protective factors for subjective sleep quality. The participant reports modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) and a borderline-elevated depressive symptom score (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07); both measures have moderate positive correlations with PSQI in this sample (r ≈ 0.40 and 0.49, respectively). Stress is also somewhat above average (Z = 0.65), and self-esteem is lower than average (RSES Z = -1.01). These psychological characteristics—particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms—tend to be associated with worse self-reported sleep in this dataset and therefore increase the likelihood of a higher PSQI score. Conversely, the participant reports healthful behavioral patterns that generally protect sleep: frequent exercise (regular exercise Z-scores >1.0), minimal substance and drug use, and no daytime napping; these behaviors are associated with better sleep outcomes in the population-level correlations (small negative correlations with PSQI).

Wearable-derived circadian and physiological data are consistent with a robust and regular daily rhythm. Interdaily stability is high (0.65, Z = 1.99), intradaily variability is low (0.34, Z = -1.45), and cosinor amplitude is relatively large (15.84, Z = 1.64). Resting heart rate is low (49.4 bpm, Z = -1.04), and the aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal trough (around -30 bpm from mesor between ~2–5 AM, Z ≈ -2.2 to -2.4) with clear daytime elevations and an acrophase in the late afternoon (4:05 PM). These features indicate strong day–night consolidation of physiology and relatively consistent timing of activity and rest—characteristics that are typically associated with more consolidated, higher-quality sleep and lower sleep fragmentation.

Objective sleep timing and duration present a mixed picture. Median nightly sleep duration is about 6 hours 14 minutes (Z = -1.18), which is shorter than the study average, and the median sleep start time is late (00:54) but with low night-to-night variability (sleep start SD ≈ 34 minutes, Z = -1.07). Sleep-duration variability is modest (SD 62 minutes, Z = -0.88). Shorter sleep duration and a late habitual bedtime can contribute to poorer subjective sleep quality, but the participant’s consistent timing and low variability reduce the likelihood of highly fragmented or irregular sleep patterns. In this sample, sleep duration alone shows little direct correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.05), whereas mood/anxiety measures show stronger relationships with PSQI.

Integrative interpretation and PSQI-group assessment: Psychological risk indicators (moderate trait anxiety, modest depressive symptoms, and elevated stress) point toward a higher PSQI (worse subjective sleep), and these measures have the strongest sample-level correlations with PSQI. By contrast, objective wearable indicators—high interdaily stability, low intradaily variability, pronounced nocturnal heart-rate decline, high rhythm amplitude, low resting heart rate, regular sleep timing, frequent exercise, and minimal substance use—are protective and align with better sleep consolidation and lower fragmentation. The participant’s relatively short total sleep time and late bedtime are potential detractors but are counterbalanced by strong circadian regularity and healthful behaviors. On balance, because affective measures (which are more predictive of subjective sleep in this dataset) are elevated while sleep duration is below average, the overall pattern is more consistent with somewhat poorer subjective sleep relative to the broader student sample. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the higher PSQI half of the study distribution (worse sleep quality), though not at an extreme level.

74413,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: The participant’s self-report measures indicate relatively low affective symptom burden and generally healthy lifestyle behaviors. Depressive symptom scores (CES-D = 6, Z = -0.76) and trait anxiety (STAI = 31, Z = -1.02) are below the sample mean, and reported stress is also low (Z = -0.98). The participant reports frequent solitary exercise (three times per week or more; Z = 1.07) and minimal substance use across beer, wine/liquor, and recreational/non-prescribed drugs (Z-scores all negative and well below sample averages). Social and recreational screen time are low (internet, video games, TV all marked as “do not do” or minimal), while reading time is relatively elevated (Z = 1.3). Health satisfaction is somewhat lower than average (Z = -1.20), but overall the self-report pattern suggests a stable, low-symptom psychological profile and health behaviors that are more consistent with preserved sleep-promoting habits than with behaviors that typically degrade sleep.

Wearable-derived sleep behavior: Objective sleep metrics from the wearable indicate sleep quantity and stability that are at or above the study average. Median nightly sleep duration is 7 hours 34 minutes (Z = 0.47), and night-to-night variability in duration is relatively low (SD = 42 minutes, Z = -1.34), reflecting consistent total sleep time across the recording period. Median sleep start time is shortly after midnight (00:31) with modest night-to-night variability in start time (SD = 67 minutes, Z = -0.35). Daytime napping is negligible (mean daily naps 0.08, Z = 0.12). These objective sleep features — adequate nightly duration and low variability — are typically associated with better subjective sleep quality and would tend to predict a lower PSQI score rather than greater sleep disturbance.

Circadian and heart rate patterns: Heart-rate–derived circadian metrics show a mixed picture of regularity. Parametric metrics (MESOR ≈ 75 bpm, amplitude ≈ 11 bpm, acrophase ≈ 6:27 PM) are near sample averages, while non-parametric measures indicate somewhat reduced day-to-day regularity (interdaily stability = 0.36, Z = -0.41) combined with increased intraday fragmentation (intradaily variability = 0.76, Z = 1.51). The participant’s resting heart rate is low (55.4 bpm, Z = -0.33), consistent with relatively good cardiovascular conditioning. Aggregated hourly deviations from the mesor show the expected large nocturnal reductions in heart rate (largest negative deviations between ~3–7 AM), but also a pronounced positive deviation in the late evening (10–11 PM deviation = +22.05 bpm, Z = 2.46) and elevated values around midnight–1 AM. This pattern suggests elevated physiological arousal or activity in the late-evening window prior to sleep onset for this cohort. The combination of increased intraday variability and late-evening heart rate elevation could reflect evening activity patterns or transient physiological arousal that fragment rest-activity structure, even though the major overnight period shows the expected heart-rate nadir.

Integration and interpretation for sleep quality: Weighing multimodal evidence, the strongest indicators favor relatively good objective sleep quantity and stability: above-average median sleep duration, low night-to-night variability in duration, consistent sleep start times, and minimal napping. Self-report measures (low depressive symptoms, low anxiety, low stress, regular exercise, little substance use) further support conditions that typically correspond with better subjective sleep. Countervailing signals that could elevate reported sleep disturbance include elevated intradaily variability (suggesting fragmented rest-activity patterns) and marked late-evening heart rate elevations (suggesting pre-sleep physiological arousal). However, these circadian/physiological deviations are moderate in scope relative to the robust signals of adequate and regular sleep duration and healthy psychosocial functioning. Correlations between many wearable or survey metrics and PSQI in this dataset are generally small, and the objective sleep values that most directly predict poorer PSQI (e.g., short sleep duration, high variability) are not present here. On balance, the preponderance of evidence supports placement in the lower half of the sample distribution for PSQI (i.e., relatively good or average sleep quality).

77789,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Multimodal psychological profile: Self-report measures indicate elevated depressive symptomatology (CES-D = 20, Z = 0.7, classified “Depressed”) and modestly elevated trait anxiety (STAI = 43, Z = 0.17). These trait-level affective signals are accompanied by slightly lower-than-average self-esteem (RSES = 36, Z = -0.31) and reduced satisfaction with physical health (health satisfaction Z = -0.86). Correlations provided in the dataset show moderate positive associations between these affective measures and PSQI (CES-D correlation with PSQI = 0.50; STAI correlation = 0.40), indicating that the participant’s elevated mood symptoms and anxious tendencies are likely to contribute substantially to worse subjective sleep quality.

Behavioral and lifestyle patterns: The participant reports minimal substance use (alcohol use infrequent, no recreational or non-prescribed drug use) and essentially no napping (mean daily naps = 0.0, Z = -0.86). Physical activity is low (exercise alone 1–2×/month, exercise with others and sports “not at all”), and social/leisure activities are minimal. Reading is an outlier (16–30 minutes, Z = 1.3) but overall the behavioral profile reflects low engagement in structured daytime physical and social activities. Low daytime activity combined with elevated BMI (27.45) and lower health satisfaction may be relevant to sleep physiology and perceived sleep quality.

Objective circadian and cardiovascular signals: Wearable-derived circadian metrics show a raised overall heart-rate level (Mesor = 83.16 bpm, Z = 1.26; Resting HR = 68.7 bpm, Z = 1.25) together with reduced circadian amplitude (Amplitude = 7.73, Z = -0.99). Interdaily stability is modestly above average (0.49, Z = 0.67) while intradaily variability is relatively low (0.49, Z = -0.39), suggesting reasonably consistent day-to-day timing but a blunted day–night heart-rate contrast. The combination of elevated baseline cardiovascular tone and low amplitude of circadian variation is consistent with a profile of increased physiological arousal or sympathetic predominance across the recording period, a pattern often associated with poorer sleep quality and with the provided small positive correlation between resting HR and PSQI (r ≈ 0.12).

Hourly heart-rate deviations and sleep timing: Aggregated hourly deviations show the expected overnight reduction of heart rate (large negative deviations −13 to −17 bpm across ~2–7 AM) and a pronounced morning positive deviation peak (8–9 AM = +12.3 bpm, Z = 1.71). These hourly patterns indicate preserved nocturnal HR decline in absolute terms, but because the mesor and resting HR are elevated and the amplitude is reduced, the relative day–night contrast is diminished. Sleep timing derived from the wearable indicates a late median sleep onset (01:19 AM) and a median sleep duration of 6 hours 32 minutes (Z = -0.8), with highly variable nightly durations (sleep duration SD = 166 minutes, Z = 1.49). The high night-to-night variability in sleep length is notable given its positive correlation with PSQI (r ≈ 0.20) and is likely to degrade perceived and objective sleep continuity and restorative function.

Integrated interpretation regarding sleep quality: Multiple convergent signals point toward relatively poorer sleep quality. Psychologically, elevated depressive symptoms and trait anxiety (both moderately correlated with PSQI) create a substantial liability for greater subjective sleep disturbances. Behaviorally, late sleep timing, short median sleep duration (~6.5 hours), and high night-to-night variability (SD ≈ 166 minutes) are sleep-pattern features that typically relate to worse PSQI scores. Physiologically, an elevated resting HR and mesor with reduced circadian amplitude indicate a blunted autonomic day–night differentiation, which is commonly associated with impaired sleep consolidation and lower sleep quality. Some mitigating signs exist (no daily naps, low intradaily variability, and modest interdaily stability), but these are outweighed by the combination of affective burden, late and irregular sleep timing, and elevated baseline cardiovascular tone.

Overall PSQI group assessment: On balance, the preponderance of evidence — elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety (strong PSQI correlations), late average sleep onset, below-average median sleep duration, pronounced night-to-night variability in sleep duration, and an elevated resting HR with reduced circadian amplitude — supports classification in the worse-sleep (higher PSQI) half of the study sample distribution.

88882,6.0,0.387434554973822,"Psychological and behavioral profile: Self-report instruments indicate generally favorable psychological functioning and lifestyle habits. Scores on measures of depressive symptoms (CES-D = 2) and trait anxiety (STAI = 28) are well below the study mean (Z-scores ≈ -1.2 and -1.3, respectively), and measures of happiness and self-esteem are above average (happy Z = 1.64; self-esteem Z = 1.1). Stress is below the sample mean (Z ≈ -0.98). The participant reports regular exercise (exercised alone three or more times weekly) and minimal recreational drug use; alcohol use is modest (beer 1–2 times/week). Resting physiological indices consistent with good cardiovascular fitness (resting heart rate ≈ 47 bpm, Z ≈ -1.28) further align with a generally healthy psychosocial and physical profile that would tend to protect sleep quality.

Observed sleep timing and duration (wearable + self-report): Wearable-derived sleep metrics show a habitual late sleep timing and short nightly sleep. Median sleep start time is late (02:34 AM) and median nightly sleep duration is roughly 5 hours 57 minutes (Z ≈ -1.53), placing the participant well below the sample mean for sleep length. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration and in sleep start time is not elevated (sleep duration SD ≈ 68 minutes, sleep start SD ≈ 40 minutes; both Z-scores indicate less variability than many peers), indicating that although the participant goes to bed late and sleeps less, those features are relatively consistent across days. Napping is minimal. Taken together, the dominant behavioral sleep signature is compressed, late-night sleep that is regularly scheduled rather than erratic.

Circadian structure and hourly physiology: Heart-rate–based circadian features present a mixed picture. Mesor and resting heart rate are lower than average (mesor ≈ 65 bpm, Z ≈ -1.22; resting HR ≈ 47 bpm, Z ≈ -1.28), consistent with high cardiovascular fitness. Amplitude is near the cohort mean while acrophase centers in the early evening (≈ 6:01 PM), indicating an evening metabolic/physiological peak. Non-parametric circadian metrics show reduced interdaily stability (value = 0.34, Z ≈ -0.57) and slightly elevated intradaily variability (value = 0.63, Z ≈ 0.60). This pattern suggests the participant’s within-day heart rate fluctuations are somewhat fragmented and that the day-to-day regularity of the cardiac rhythm is below average, even though bedtime timing itself is fairly consistent. Aggregated hourly heart-rate deviations highlight notable elevation in the hour around 1–2 AM (deviation +14.11; Z ≈ 3.10) followed by substantial suppression across the 2–7 AM window (deviations −10 to −25). Given the late median sleep onset (~2:34 AM), the 1–2 AM HR elevation likely indexes a physiologically active or aroused pre‑sleep period (or late-evening activity), with a pronounced nocturnal decline once sleep is attained.

Integration and implications for sleep quality: The strongest signals relevant to global sleep quality are the short median sleep duration (≈6 hours, substantially below the sample mean) and the late habitual sleep timing. Short sleep duration is a primary driver of poorer scores on the PSQI sleep-duration and overall component scores, and late bedtime may contribute to impaired daytime functioning or subjective sleep complaints even when timing is consistent. Physiological markers (elevated HR at 1–2 AM, elevated intradaily variability, and reduced interdaily stability) suggest some degree of within-day fragmentation and weaker day-to-day circadian regularity, which could amplify subjective sleep disruptions. Countervailing influences include very low depressive and anxiety symptomatology, high subjective happiness and self-esteem, good fitness, minimal napping, and relatively stable bedtimes; these factors are associated with better subjective sleep quality. Overall, however, the magnitude of the short sleep duration and the late timing—both salient PSQI-relevant features—are likely to produce a PSQI profile that is worse than average in this cohort.

PSQI group judgment: weighing the relatively large deviation in nightly sleep duration (Z ≈ -1.53), late median sleep timing (≈2:34 AM), the physiological signature of late-night arousal (1–2 AM HR elevation), and evidence of modest circadian fragmentation, the balance of evidence favors placement in the poorer-sleep half of the sample distribution.

19245,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological and behavioral profile:
The participant reports elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D = 26; Z = 1.32) and trait anxiety (STAI = 55; Z = 1.35), alongside elevated perceived stress (Score = 27; Z = 1.47). Self-esteem is modestly below the sample mean (RSES = 35; Z = -0.45), and self-reported happiness and trust of others are both comparatively low (happiness Z = -1.61; trust Z = -2.07). Academic performance is strong (GPAs 3.73–4.0), and the participant engages in regular exercise (exercised alone ≥3×/week; Z = 1.07). Substance use is present at low-to-moderate levels (beer 1–2×/week; recreational drug use low but relatively elevated versus peers, Z = 1.61). The pattern of elevated mood symptom scores and stress is relevant because these measures show moderate positive correlations with PSQI in the sample (CES-D r ≈ 0.49; STAI r ≈ 0.40), indicating they are likely to co-occur with worse subjective sleep quality.

Sleep timing, duration, and variability:
Objective sleep from the wearable shows a late and highly variable sleep schedule. Median sleep onset is very late (02:38 AM) with high night-to-night variability in start time (SD ≈ 125 minutes; Z = 0.92). Median nightly sleep duration is relatively long (8 h 6 min; Z = 1.14) but also highly variable across nights (sleep duration SD ≈ 155 minutes; Z = 1.23). The participant also naps with above-average frequency (mean daily naps = 0.27; Z = 2.27). These features—late average sleep timing, substantial variability in both onset and duration, and frequent napping—are behaviorally consistent with an evening/irregular schedule and are plausibly contributors to sleep disturbance and daytime dysfunction; variability and nap frequency show small-to-moderate positive associations with PSQI in the sample (duration SD r ≈ 0.20; naps r ≈ 0.17).

Circadian and cardiovascular physiology:
Heart-rate–based circadian metrics indicate a relatively low mesor and low resting heart rate (Mesor = 66.42, Z = -1.03; resting HR = 49.6 bpm, Z = -1.02), which is consistent with good baseline cardiovascular fitness. Amplitude of the fitted rhythm is small (Amplitude = 10.08; Z = -0.23) and interdaily stability is below average (0.31; Z = -0.82), implying modest day-to-day regularity of circadian heart rate patterns. Hourly aggregated deviations reveal elevated relative heart rate in late evening/early night hours (notably 10–11 PM and 11–12 AM with high positive Z-scores of 2.25 and 1.98, respectively) and pronounced reductions during typical sleep hours (large negative deviations across 2–8 AM). The late-evening heart rate elevations suggest physiological arousal or activity around typical bedtimes for many peers, which, together with the delayed sleep onset, is consistent with a delayed/shifted sleep schedule and may interfere with sleep initiation or subjective sleep quality.

Integration regarding sleep quality (PSQI-relevant evidence):
Several converging indicators point toward relatively poorer sleep quality: (1) psychological symptom burden (depressive and anxiety symptoms) that are moderately correlated with worse PSQI in the sample; (2) very late median sleep onset with substantial night-to-night variability in timing and duration; (3) frequent napping; and (4) physiological signs of elevated arousal in the late evening (elevated HR deviations before midnight). Countervailing evidence includes objectively long median nightly sleep duration (≈8 h) and a low resting heart rate, which might mitigate some aspects of daytime impairment. However, the combination of elevated affective symptoms, irregular and delayed sleep timing, and evening physiological activation more strongly aligns with factors that tend to increase PSQI scores (poorer global sleep quality) than with uniformly good sleep. Sample correlations provided in the dataset further support this interpretation (e.g., CES-D r = 0.49; STAI r = 0.40; sleep variability and naps with smaller positive correlations).

Overall PSQI group assessment:
Weighing the pattern of elevated mood symptoms and stress, delayed and irregular sleep timing, frequent napping, and late-evening physiological activation—despite adequate median sleep duration—the evidence more strongly supports that this participant would fall in the higher (worse) half of the PSQI distribution in this study population.

The participant’s survey profile shows generally favorable psychological and lifestyle characteristics. Scores indicate low depressive symptom burden (CES-D = 9) and low trait anxiety (STAI = 24), alongside elevated self-reported happiness and self-esteem (high Z-scores). Health satisfaction is above average and substance use is minimal. The participant reports frequent physical activity (exercise and sports three times per week or more), and academic performance is solid. One notable lifestyle feature is limited time spent socializing, which is well below the sample mean; otherwise recreational screen time and other sedentary hobbies are minimal. Taken together, these self-report data point to relatively good psychological well-being, active physical habits, and generally health-promoting behaviors—all factors typically associated with better subjective sleep quality.

Wearable-derived sleep and circadian characteristics:
Fitbit-derived sleep statistics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of approximately 6 hours 54 minutes (slightly below the study mean; Z ≈ -0.35) with little night-to-night variability in sleep onset (median start time ~00:20 and sleep start SD ≈ 41 minutes, Z ≈ -0.93). The participant reports essentially no naps. Circadian summary metrics show modestly reduced inter-daily stability (0.37, Z ≈ -0.33) and a small elevation in intradaily variability (0.56, Z ≈ 0.10), with a low autocorrelation at 24 hours (0.22, Z ≈ -0.87). These combined signals suggest that while sleep timing is relatively consistent for this individual, the heart-rate–based circadian rhythm displays somewhat weakened day-to-day regularity and modest within-day fragmentation compared with the sample average.

Cardiovascular patterning and timing:
Aggregate hourly heart-rate deviations relative to the mesor reflect a pronounced diurnal contrast with expected nocturnal troughs (largest negative deviations between ~2–6 AM, down ≈ -16 to -23 bpm) and marked afternoon/evening peaks (notably 5–7 PM with deviations +22 to +28 bpm). Resting heart rate and mesor are lower than average (resting HR ≈ 55 bpm, mesor ≈ 69 bpm), consistent with higher aerobic fitness and the participant’s frequent exercise. Of particular note is an unusually large positive deviation at the 11 PM–12 AM hour (≈ +27 bpm; Z ≈ +3.51), while the 12–1 AM hour immediately afterward shows a negative deviation. This pattern may reflect transient late-evening arousal or activity (e.g., brief vigorous activity, emotional or cognitive activation) prior to the participant’s typical sleep onset near 00:20, or it could reflect measurement variability. Overall, the heart-rate profile is consistent with an athletic individual who is physiologically quiescent overnight but shows occasional strong evening autonomic activation.

Integration and implications for sleep quality:
Multiple lines of evidence point toward relatively adequate sleep quality for this participant. Sleep duration is near 7 hours and sleep onset timing is consistent across nights; subjective mental health and daytime functioning indices are favorable (low depressive and anxiety symptoms, high happiness and self-esteem), and there is little substance use. Frequent exercise and low resting heart rate typically support sleep consolidation. Countervailing signals include modestly reduced circadian stability and a pronounced late-evening heart-rate spike (11–12 PM), which could indicate episodic pre-sleep arousal for some nights; sleep duration is slightly below the sample mean and there is modest within-day variability in heart rate. Correlations between many wearable/circadian features and PSQI in this dataset are small in magnitude, suggesting no strong objective indicator of poor sleep.

PSQI group judgment:
Weighing the evidence holistically, the balance of indicators (near-7-hour median sleep, stable sleep onset timing, low mood/anxiety symptoms, frequent exercise, low substance use, and overall favorable self-reports) favors relatively good or average sleep quality compared with the study population. Although there are minor concerns regarding reduced circadian stability and occasional late-evening physiological activation, these do not outweigh the preponderance of favorable markers. Therefore the participant is more likely to fall in the bottom half of the PSQI distribution (i.e., lower PSQI scores indicating relatively better/average sleep quality).

63347,7.0,0.6047120418848168,"Psychological traits and lifestyle behaviors
Self-report measures indicate a mixed profile of psychological functioning and health behaviors. Depressive symptoms (CES-D = 14, Z = 0.07) are close to the study mean and classified as “not depressed,” while trait anxiety (STAI = 45, Z = 0.37) is elevated relative to peers and has a modest positive correlation with worse PSQI scores in this sample (r ≈ 0.40). Self-esteem is at the high end of the scale (RSES = 40, Z = 0.26) and subjective happiness is above average (score = 4.0, Z = 0.55), both factors that correlate weakly in the expected direction with better sleep. The participant reports low physical activity (multiple exercise items Z-scores ≈ -1.6 to -1.9), limited socializing and recreational screen time, and minimal substance use. Body mass index is elevated (BMI = 28.7) and self-rated health satisfaction is lower than average (score = 3.22, Z = -0.78). In sum, the psychological and lifestyle profile shows some risk factors for poorer sleep (elevated trait anxiety, low exercise, higher BMI, lower health satisfaction) alongside protective factors (high self-esteem, low substance use, moderate happiness).

Wearable-derived circadian and cardiac physiology
Folded heart-rate features indicate a relatively strong and regular circadian rhythm. Parametric circadian measures are pronounced: mesor (mean level) is elevated relative to the study sample (82.2 bpm, Z = 1.13) and amplitude is substantially higher than peers (16.02 bpm, Z = 1.69), while acrophase is in the early evening (≈ 5:43 PM). Non-parametric rhythm metrics show above-average interdaily stability (0.48, Z = 0.58) and low intradaily variability (0.35, Z = -1.38), and autocorrelation at 24 hours is high (0.44, Z = 0.98). Together these indicate consistent day-to-day timing of activity/physiology and relatively low fragmentation of the circadian signal—features that are generally associated with better objective sleep consolidation. Resting heart rate is modestly low (56.9 bpm, Z = -0.15). Hourly aggregate deviations show a pronounced nocturnal heart-rate nadir (largest negative deviations of ~ -25 bpm between ~3–7 AM) and a prominent evening peak (largest positive deviation ~24.7 bpm at 7–8 PM, Z = 2.29), implying clear day–night separation in autonomic tone but also relatively elevated evening arousal.

Objective and self-reported sleep behavior
Wearable sleep metrics indicate a median nightly sleep duration of about 6 hours 49 minutes (Z = -0.46), placing the participant below the study median for duration but not extremely so. Night-to-night variability in sleep duration is relatively high (SD ≈ 151 minutes, Z = 1.14), indicating inconsistent total sleep time across nights; sleep start time is late on average (median ≈ 01:28 AM) with a moderate spread (start SD ≈ 80 minutes, Z ≈ -0.06). Napping is rare. These sleep timing and variability features are relevant because later sleep onset and greater variability in sleep duration are both correlated with higher PSQI scores in this dataset (sleep variability r ≈ 0.20; timing variability r ≈ 0.18). At the same time, the low intradaily variability and high interdaily stability from the wearable data argue for a relatively structured daily rhythm, which can mitigate some consequences of late timing.

Integrative interpretation regarding sleep quality (PSQI)
Evidence for poorer sleep quality: the participant has a late habitual sleep onset (~1:28 AM), a median nightly duration below 7 hours, and elevated night-to-night variability in sleep length; trait anxiety is above average and correlates positively with PSQI in this sample. These features (late timing, short median duration, high variability, and higher anxiety) are each associated with higher PSQI scores and could contribute to greater subjective sleep disturbance. Evidence for comparatively better sleep: robust circadian structure (high interdaily stability, low intradaily fragmentation, high 24-hour autocorrelation), low resting heart rate, minimal naps, and limited substance use are all indicators that favor objectively consolidated sleep and lower disturbance. Balancing these data, the most salient risks for poorer PSQI in this participant are the late bedtimes and the sizable night-to-night variability combined with elevated trait anxiety and low physical activity. The circadian regularity appears to moderate risk but does not fully offset the impact of late timing and inconsistent sleep duration, both of which tend to influence the components of the PSQI (latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances). Therefore, when integrating self-report and wearable signals with their known associations to PSQI in this sample, the overall pattern is more consistent with a PSQI score in the higher half of the study distribution.
