The correlation between the initial PSS score and change in PSS score is -0.56, suggesting a moderate negative relationship between the initial stress level and subsequent changes in stress.

Self-reported surveys show a decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale (Score: 9.0, Z-score: -0.37) and a decrease in anxiety symptoms as measured by the STAI scale (Score: 31.0, Z-score: -0.91). The participant's self-esteem has slightly increased (Score: 45.0, Z-score: 1.06). These changes suggest an overall positive trend in the participant's mental health.

The wearable activity metrics indicate a relatively stable circadian rhythm with an interdaily stability score of 0.4 (Z-score: -0.42) and an intraday variability score of 0.45 (Z-score: -0.88). The mesor value of 76.01 (Z-score: 0.31) and amplitude of 13.15 (Z-score: 0.84) also suggest a regular sleep-wake cycle. However, the resting heart rate has decreased by 3.3 beats per minute (Z-score: -0.66), which may indicate improved cardiovascular health.

Sleep statistics show a slight increase in median sleep duration (6 hours 29 minutes) and a decrease in sleep duration standard deviation (90 minutes). The median sleep start time has become earlier by 25 minutes. These changes suggest improved sleep quality and consistency.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data show a relatively consistent pattern across the day, with a slight decrease in heart rate during late morning and early afternoon hours. This may indicate a more relaxed state during these periods.

Considering the correlations between changes in metrics and changes in PSS score, the data suggest that the participant's perceived stress level has remained relatively stable. The decrease in depressive and anxiety symptoms, the increase in self-esteem, and the improved sleep quality and cardiovascular health may have contributed to a stable stress level. However, the slight decrease in resting heart rate and the consistent aggregated hourly heart rate pattern may also indicate a more relaxed state.

The correlation between the initial PSS score and change in PSS score is -0.56, suggesting that higher initial stress levels are associated with greater reductions in stress over time.

Self-reported survey data reveals a mix of stable and changing behaviors. The participant's Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score remains stable at 3.0, with no significant changes in depressive symptoms. In contrast, the participant's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score decreases from 32.0 to 28.0, indicating a reduction in anxiety levels. The participant's self-esteem score remains relatively stable at 43.0. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) does not indicate any notable changes in self-worth.

The participant's sleep habits show some changes. The median sleep duration increases by 32 minutes, with the participant reporting a greater desired sleep time of 9.0 hours. However, the sleep duration standard deviation decreases by 39 minutes, and the median sleep start time becomes earlier by 25 minutes. These changes may suggest an improvement in sleep quality and consistency.

Wearable activity metrics provide additional insights. The participant's interdaily stability and intradaily variability in heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics are relatively stable. The mesor (average heart rate) decreases by 4.42 beats per minute, and the amplitude increases by 0.39 beats per minute. The resting heart rate decreases by 3.6 beats per minute. These changes could indicate a reduction in physiological arousal and an improvement in cardiovascular health.

The participant engages in regular exercise alone (three times a week or more) and with others (not at all), and participates in sports at a frequency of 1-2 times a week. Daily recreation habits are relatively stable, with some decreases in sedentary activities.

Considering these multifaceted changes, the participant's overall perceived stress level appears to have decreased. The reduction in anxiety levels (as measured by STAI) and improvements in sleep quality and consistency contribute to this assessment.

This shift indicates a substantial improvement in the participant's mental health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) reveals a slight decrease in self-esteem, with a score delta of -1.0, which may be related to the participant's changing life circumstances or experiences.

In terms of physiological metrics, the participant's resting heart rate has decreased by -2.7 beats per minute, with a Z-score change of -0.53. This reduction in resting heart rate could be indicative of improved cardiovascular health or increased physical fitness. Moreover, the aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a general decrease in heart rate across most hours of the day, with some hours exhibiting more pronounced decreases than others. For instance, the 4-5 am and 5-6 am periods show a decrease of -3.52 and -3.19 beats per minute, respectively. These changes may suggest an overall decrease in physiological arousal or stress levels.

The sleep statistics reveal a slight increase in median sleep duration by 2 minutes and a decrease in sleep duration standard deviation by -24 minutes. These subtle changes may indicate improved sleep quality or consistency. However, the median sleep start time has been delayed by 5 minutes, which could be related to changes in the participant's daily routine or schedule.

The circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data indicate a moderate increase in interdaily stability (Z-score of 0.41) and a slight increase in amplitude (Z-score of -0.01). These changes suggest a more regular and structured daily routine, which may contribute to improved overall wellbeing.

Correlations between changes in metrics and the PSS score provide additional insights. For example, the negative correlation of -0.56 between the initial PSS score and its change suggests that participants with higher initial stress levels tend to experience greater reductions in stress over time. Moreover, the negative correlation of -0.08 between the change in sleep start time and the PSS score implies that later sleep start times are associated with lower stress levels.

73158,"The participant's data reveals a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that have evolved over time. Notably, the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score has been the primary focus of this analysis. With an initial PSS score of 19.0 and a Z-score of -0.71, the participant started from a position of relative stress resilience compared to their peers. The correlation of -0.56 between the initial PSS score and its change suggests that higher initial stress levels are associated with greater reductions in stress over time.

The self-reported surveys provide valuable insights into the participant's psychological state and behaviors. For instance, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) shows a score of 1.0 with a Z-score of -1.22, indicating lower depressive symptoms compared to the study population. However, the change in the CES-D score is minimal (1.0) with a Z-score of Delta at 0.25 and a correlation of 0.26. The participant's STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) score indicates a non-anxious classification with a slight increase in anxiety proneness (Score Delta of 1.0). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score is at 49.0 with a Z-score of 1.65 suggesting average self-esteem levels. The minimal change (-1.0) with a Z-score of Delta at -0.16 and correlation of -0.06 may indicate a slight negative adjustment in self-esteem over time.

Physiological and behavioral metrics derived from wearable Fitbits offer complementary views on the participant's daily life. Sleep statistics show a current median sleep duration of 6 hours and 47 minutes with a previous duration of 6 hours and 11 minutes. The increase in sleep duration (36 minutes) with a positive Z-score of Delta (0.56) could suggest better sleep quality or duration. The sleep start time has become earlier by 9 minutes with a negative Z-score of Delta (-0.21) and a correlation of -0.18. These sleep patterns may reflect adjustments in lifestyle or daily routines.

The participant's heart rate variability and circadian rhythm metrics can indicate stress and physiological arousal levels. The current resting heart rate is at 48.5 beats per minute (bpm) with a slight increase from the previous measurement (0.9 bpm). The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows variations throughout the day, with notable peaks during late morning and early afternoon hours. This could reflect natural circadian patterns or specific daily activities causing spikes in heart rate.

Considering the correlations between changes in the values and changes in the PSS score, the analysis aims to understand the direction of change in the participant's perceived stress. An increase in the PSS score would indicate worsening stress levels, while a stable or decreasing score would suggest improvement or stability in stress management.

After synthesizing the multimodal data, the evidence suggests that the participant's overall perceived stress has **not increased significantly**. Although specific metrics like sleep duration and heart rate variability show changes, these are more indicative of adjustments in lifestyle or physiological responses rather than outright stress increases. The stability in CES-D and STAI scores further supports the notion that the participant's psychological state has not deteriorated significantly. Given the information and correlations provided** the conclusion is that the participant's stress levels have remained relatively stable or have decreased**. Thus** the direction of change in perceived stress is towards stability or decrease rather than an increase**.

The resting heart rate has increased by 5.1 beats per minute, with a Z-score of 1.12. 

The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a consistent pattern of higher heart rates during the day and lower heart rates at night. The sleep statistics reveal a decrease in median sleep duration and an earlier sleep start time. The median sleep duration has decreased by 21 minutes and the sleep start time has advanced by 5 minutes. The sleep duration standard deviation has decreased by 81 minutes. 

The correlations between the changes in the values and changes in the PSS score are essential in guiding the interpretation. The participant's initial PSS score has been included to provide anchoring regarding the initial PSS state of the participant. A comprehensive analysis of the correlations and the changes in the PSS score over time will enable the determination of whether the participant's overall perceived stress has improved or worsened.

Considering the improvements in depressive symptoms, the decrease in anxiety proneness, and the increase in self-esteem, as well as the physiological and behavioral changes, it can be concluded that the participant's overall perceived stress has likely remained stable or decreased. The correlations between the changes in the values and changes in the PSS score support this interpretation. Therefore:

The initial Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 27.0 suggests a moderate level of stress. Notably, the correlation between the initial PSS score and changes in the PSS score is -0.56, indicating a potential inverse relationship between the initial stress levels and subsequent changes.

Self-reported surveys indicate a decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale (delta = -1.0). The participant's anxiety trait as assessed by the STAI scale shows a negligible change (delta = -1.0). However, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) reveals an increase in self-esteem (delta = 2.0). These changes suggest a positive shift in the participant's mental health and self-perception.

The wearable activity metrics provide additional context. The interdaily stability and intradaily variability of the participant's heart rate-based circadian rhythm show minor changes (deltas = -0.1 and 0.09, respectively). The mesor and amplitude of the circadian rhythm exhibit decreases (deltas = -0.77 and -3.89,** respectively). The resting heart rate increased by 3.5 beats per minute. These physiological changes may indicate adaptations to stress or changes in lifestyle.

Sleep statistics show an increase in median sleep duration (delta = 0 hours 55 minutes) and a decrease in sleep duration standard deviation (delta = -83 minutes). The median sleep start time is 3 minutes earlier. These changes could reflect improved sleep habits or scheduling adjustments.

The time spent watching TV/videos/movies increased (delta = 3.0), while video game usage and reading show no change. These behavioral shifts might suggest a rebalancing of leisure activities towards more social or relaxing pursuits.

Given these multifaceted changes, the overall direction of change in perceived stress is nuanced. While some metrics suggest improvements in mental health and self-esteem, others indicate potential adaptations to stress or changes in lifestyle. The decrease in depressive symptoms and increase in self-esteem are positive indicators.

The resting heart rate decreased by 6.2 beats per minute (Z-score: -1.27), which could be related to changes in stress or anxiety levels.

The sleep statistics show a median sleep duration increase of 23 minutes (Z-score: 0.31) and a sleep start time delay of 47 minutes (Z-score: -0.92). These changes might be associated with the participant's stress and anxiety levels. The aggregated hourly heart rate data show a general decrease in heart rate across most hours of the day, with some fluctuations.

Considering the correlations between changes in values and changes in PSS score, it appears that there are some relationships between changes in behavioral and physiological metrics and changes in stress levels. For example, the decrease in resting heart rate is correlated with a decrease in PSS score (correlation: -0.03). The increase in sleep duration is also correlated with a decrease in PSS score (correlation: 0.02).

98117,"The participant's data reveals a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that have evolved over time. A crucial aspect to consider is the change in the participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, which serves as a cornerstone for understanding the trajectory of their mental state. 

The participant's initial PSS score was 22.0, with a Z-score of 0.1. This relatively low Z-score indicates that the participant's initial stress level was close to the mean of the study population. The correlation between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS score is -0.56, suggesting that higher initial stress levels are associated with greater decreases in stress over time. 

In terms of self-reported surveys, the participant exhibited notable changes. For instance, their CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) score remained at 33.0, indicating a stable level of depressive symptoms. However,** the STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) score increased from 53.0 to 66.0,** suggesting an increase in anxiety levels. Conversely,** their self-esteem score decreased from 32.0 to 19.0,** indicating a decline in self-worth. 

The wearable activity metrics provide additional insights. **The interdaily stability of the participant's heart rate increased from 0.27 to 0.6,** indicating greater regularity in their circadian rhythm. **The mesor (a measure of the midpoint of the cosinor curve) increased from 81.9 to 82.07,** and the amplitude (a measure of the extent of the heart rate variation) increased from 7.12 to 12.69,** both suggesting more pronounced circadian rhythms. However,** the resting heart rate decreased from 67.2 to 66.4,** which could indicate improved cardiovascular health or a reduction in physiological arousal.

Sleep statistics show that **the median sleep duration increased by 21 minutes,** and **sleep duration standard deviation decreased by 82 minutes,** indicating more consistent sleep patterns. **The median sleep start time became earlier by 1 hour and 8 minutes,** which could affect the participant's circadian rhythm and overall sleep quality.

Given these changes,** the most salient and relevant changes** seem to be the increase in anxiety (as measured by STAI) and the decline in self-esteem. These changes are concerning because they suggest a potential worsening of the participant's mental health state. However,** improvements in sleep consistency and potential decreases in resting heart rate** could indicate some positive adaptations or better physiological health outcomes.

Considering the correlations between changes in these metrics and the change in PSS score,** it appears that the participant's overall perceived stress has worsened.** This conclusion is primarily driven by the increase in anxiety levels and the decline in self-esteem,** which are strongly associated with higher stress levels. While some physiological metrics like sleep consistency and resting heart rate suggest positive changes,** the psychological indicators point towards an increase in perceived stress.

Thus, the analysis concludes that the participant's PSS score has **increased,** indicating a worsening of their perceived stress level over time.

A holistic analysis of the provided metrics indicates that the participant's overall perceived stress has undergone significant changes over the two-year period.

The self-reported survey data shows a notable decrease in depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale (Score: 18.0, Z-score: 0.59), with a score delta of -21.0 and a Z-score delta of -2.19. This suggests a positive shift in the participant's mental health. Conversely, the STAI–Trait scale indicates a decrease in anxiety proneness (Score: 41.0, Z-score: 0.12), with a score delta of -19.0 and a Z-score delta of -2.2. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) shows a moderate increase in self-esteem (Score: 40.0, Z-score: 0.33), with a score delta of 12.0 and a Z-score delta of 2.24.

Physiological and behavioral data from the wearable device provide additional context. The participant's sleep patterns have become more consistent, with a median sleep duration increase of 25 minutes (Current: '8 hours 27 minutes'、 Previous: '8 hours 2 minutes') and a decrease in sleep start time standard deviation (Current: '95 minutes'、 Previous: '55 minutes'). The interdaily stability of the participant's circadian rhythm has decreased (Current: 0.52、 Previous: 0.72), while the intraday variability has increased (Current: 0.51、 Previous: 0.34). These changes may indicate a more regulated but slightly more variable daily routine.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a general decrease in heart rate across most hours of the day, with some fluctuations. The resting heart rate has increased by 1.35 beats per minute (Current: 60.35、 Previous: 59.0). The mesor and amplitude of the circadian rhythm have decreased (Current: 72.14、 Previous: 75.63 and Current: 11.35、 Previous: 14.57 respectively), suggesting a possible reduction in physiological arousal.

Correlations between changes in these metrics and the PSS score suggest that improvements in depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness are associated with decreased perceived stress. Conversely, changes in sleep duration and heart rate variability are less clearly linked to PSS changes.

Considering the initial PSS score of 25.0 and its high Z-score of 0.92, the participant started with elevated perceived stress levels. Over the two-year period, the combination of decreased depressive symptoms, the decrease in anxiety proneness、 and improvements in self-esteem suggest that the participant's perceived stress has likely decreased or remained stable.

Given the multifaceted nature of the data and the various correlations between metric changes and PSS score changes、 it is reasonable to conclude that the participant's perceived stress has remained stable or decreased over time. Therefore、 the direction of change in perceived stress is classified as follows：

Over the two-year period, the participant's PSS score has not significantly changed, as evidenced by the correlation of -0.56 between the initial PSS score and the change in PSS score.

The self-reported surveys show a mixed picture. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score remains stable at 5.0, indicating no significant change in depressive symptoms. In contrast, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score has increased from 27.0 to 30.0, suggesting a slight increase in anxiety levels. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) score has decreased from 46.0 to 44.0, indicating a slight decline in self-esteem.

Physiological metrics derived from the wearable device provide further insight. The interdaily stability of the participant's heart rate has decreased from 0.32 to 0.34 (Z-score: -1.07 to -0.94)， indicating a less stable circadian rhythm. The intradaily variability has increased from 0.44 to 0.51 (Z-score: -0.74 to -0.5)， suggesting greater fluctuations in heart rate within days. The mesor (average heart rate) has decreased from 71.99 to 65.71 (Z-score: -0.38 to -1.15)， and the amplitude has increased from 6.61 to 7.31 (Z-score: -1.27 to -1.29)， indicating potential changes in cardiovascular activity.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a generally consistent pattern across the day， with a slight increase in heart rate during late evening and nighttime hours. This could be indicative of increased physiological arousal during these periods.

Considering the changes in the participant's behavior and physiology、 the most notable changes are the increase in anxiety levels、 the decrease in self-esteem、 and the changes in sleep patterns. However、 the overall perceived stress level (PSS score) has not significantly changed over the two-year period.

The correlations between the changes in the values and changes in the PSS score are mostly weak or non-significant、 suggesting that the changes in the participant's behavior and physiology may not be directly related to changes in their perceived stress levels.

In conclusion、 based on the holistic analysis of the evidence、 the participant's PSS score has remained relatively stable over the two-year period. The slight changes in anxiety levels、 self-esteem、 and sleep patterns may not be directly related to the perceived stress levels、 but could be indicative of other underlying factors.

One of the most notable changes is in their CES-D score, which has increased from 16.0 to 34.0, indicating a higher frequency of depressive symptoms. This change is accompanied by a significant increase in their STAI score from 37.0 to 53.0, suggesting a rise in anxiety proneness. Conversely, their self-esteem score has decreased substantially from 41.0 to 22.0. These changes in psychological traits and symptoms are concerning and may be indicative of a worsening mental health state.

In terms of behavioral habits, the participant has shown a decrease in exercise frequency when alone and with others. Their sedentary hobby time has also decreased significantly from more than 4 hours to 16-30 minutes per day. On the other hand, their socializing time with friends has increased from 1-2 hours to 2-3 hours per day. Internet usage has decreased from 2-3 hours to 1-2 hours per day. These changes suggest a possible shift towards more social interactions but less engagement in physical activities and solitary hobbies.

Sleep statistics reveal a decrease in median sleep duration from 7 hours 5 minutes to 6 hours 53 minutes. The sleep duration standard deviation has increased from 63 minutes to 114 minutes. The median sleep start time has been delayed by 16 minutes. These changes may indicate poorer sleep quality and difficulty in maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.

The wearable activity metrics show a decrease in interdaily stability and an increase in intradaily variability of heart rate. The mesor and amplitude of the circadian rhythm have also changed. The resting heart rate has increased from 54.0 to 57.2. These changes could be indicative of physiological stress or arousal. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows variations across the day but no clear trend emerges.

Given these findings, the overall direction of change in perceived stress is likely to be an increase. The participant's initial PSS score was 20.0 and the correlation with change is -0.56. Although some behaviors and physiological metrics have changed in potentially positive ways (e.g., more socializing), the predominant trend appears to be towards increased stress and anxiety, as evidenced by the CES-D and STAI scores.

One of the most significant changes is the decrease in depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D scale, with a score delta of -18.0 and a Z-score of delta of -1.86. This indicates a substantial reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, the participant's anxiety levels have decreased, as shown by the STAI-Trait scale score delta of -17.0 and a Z-score of delta of -1.94. 

The participant's sleep patterns have also undergone changes. The median sleep duration has increased by 37 minutes, with a Z-score of delta of 0.58. Furthermore, the sleep start time has shifted earlier by 3 hours and 12 minutes, with a Z-score of delta of 3.59. These changes suggest improvements in sleep quality and duration. 

In terms of physiological metrics, the participant's resting heart rate has remained relatively stable with a delta of 0.3 and a Z-score of delta of 0.1. The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows variations throughout the day, but overall suggests a relatively stable cardiovascular activity level. 

The circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data indicate some changes. The interdaily stability has increased by 0.05 with a Z-score of delta of 0.41. However, the intraday variability has decreased by -0.3 with a Z-score of delta of -2.35. These changes may reflect adaptations in the participant's physiological responses to daily routines. 

Considering the correlations between changes in metrics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, it appears that decreases in depressive symptoms and anxiety levels are associated with decreases in PSS scores. Given the overall direction of change in the participant's PSS score is more aligned with stability or decrease rather than an increase.

The STAI score has decreased by -1.0 point, with a Z-score of 1.15 and a classification of ""anxious"". This indicates a slight reduction in anxiety levels. Self-esteem has decreased by -4.0 points, with a Z-score of -2.01 and no previous classification available for comparison. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) measures self-worth and scores range from 10 to 40; thus, the participant's self-esteem has decreased over time.

The participant's sleep patterns have also changed. Median sleep duration has increased by 13 minutes (from 6 hours 55 minutes to 6 hours 41 minutes) with a Z-score of -0.73. Sleep duration standard deviation has slightly increased by 2 minutes (from 70 minutes to 73 minutes). The median sleep start time has shifted 1 hour and 5 minutes later (from 01:02:30 to 02:08:15). These subtle changes might indicate minor adjustments in the participant's sleep-wake cycles and possibly reflect variations in lifestyle or daily routines.

The wearable activity metrics provide additional insights. The interdaily stability and intradaily variability of the participant's heart rate have changed; interdaily stability has decreased by -0.08 (Z-score: -1.38 to -0.67), and intradaily variability has increased by 0.19 (Z-score: 0.86 to 1.13). These changes could suggest fluctuations in the participant's physiological responses to daily activities or stressors. The mesor (77.8 vs 70.09) and amplitude (10.98 vs 10.6) of the participant's heart rate have increased and decreased, respectively. The resting heart rate has increased by 7.0 points (from 53.4 to 60.4).

Correlations between changes in these metrics and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score must be considered to assess overall stress direction.

The Mesor (a measure of the participant's heart rate amplitude) decreased from 92.44 to 86.29、 with a Z-score change from 2.29 to 1.77、 suggesting a moderate decrease in heart rate amplitude. The resting heart rate decreased from 72.3 to 67.8、 with a Z-score change from 1.64 to 1.16、 indicating a slight decrease in resting heart rate.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data show fluctuations in the participant's cardiovascular activity levels throughout the day. Notably、 the participant's heart rate increased during the late evening and nighttime hours (e.g.、 '6-7pm'、 '7-8pm'、 and '8-9pm')、 suggesting potential evening and nighttime physiological arousal.

Considering the correlations between changes in the values and changes in the PSS score、 the data suggest that the participant's perceived stress levels have remained relatively stable over time. Although some metrics indicate slight increases in anxiety and decreases in sleep duration、 the overall pattern of changes does not strongly suggest a significant worsening or improvement in the participant's perceived stress levels.

In conclusion、 the holistic analysis of the evidence suggests that the participant's PSS score has remained stable over time. The changes in the participant's psychological traits、 behaviors、 and physiological metrics do not indicate a significant increase or decrease in perceived stress levels.
