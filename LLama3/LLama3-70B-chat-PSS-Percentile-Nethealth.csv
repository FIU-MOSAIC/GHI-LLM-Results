The sleep statistics and wearable-derived metrics show the participant tends towards having regular sleep patterns and consistent circadian rhythms. The circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate and sleep data reveal that the participant has a moderate to high stress susceptibility. The PSS scores and correlations data indicate moderate stress levels in comparison to others. The participant also shows a moderate level of stress, and moderate correlations between wearable and self-reported data. The average heart rate data and sleep patterns suggest a moderate stress level, and daytime activity level.

The sleep duration and start times reveal that the participant has a relatively consistent sleep schedule. The sleep patterns and wearable-derived sleep data, show some variation, though the overall pattern suggests a relatively low to moderate stress susceptibility. The Z-scored sleep and resting heart rate suggest that the participant experiences stress but has a relatively low to moderate perceived stress level.

The participant's PSS score is not explicitly provided, but analysis of the combined data suggests that their stress level is relatively moderate to moderate. The data does not explicitly support a high stress level, but does indicate a relatively stable and moderate stress level.

The participant's data suggests a Multimodal analysis of stress, behaviors and physiological and behavioral patterns. This suggests low stress, and stress and it seems reasonable to assume average stress and perceived stress (both as reported and recorded values and reported values not measureable via wearables). The participant's general psychological state appears relatively low in stress as reported by both the survey scores and wearable data metrics available. The participant reported sleep disturbances and stress related issues, known as stress could not be determined. By analyzing both survey scores and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics, the participant's physiological state and behaviors appear to reflect relatively low or average perceived stress.

The participant’s overall psychological state, as suggested by the data, appears to be one of relatively low or average perceived stress, and their behaviors as reflected by the data are in the bottom or bottom 50 percent of the study population distribution.


The participant's profile suggests that their sleep quality could be one of the determining factors in contributing towards their perceived stress. Their average sleep duration is 8 hours 12 minutes, the participant’s typical sleep duration is slightly above the mean (Z-score = 1.26) which indicates average sleep. Also the participant’s sleep statistics recorded by Fitbit data showed that their median sleep start time is around 2:00 which indicates relatively normal sleep timing, considering their sleep patterns. The participant’s sleep duration is generally around  Mean of 8 hours and 12 minutes. They tend to have sleep that starts at 12:00 AM.


These features are indicative of good circadian rhythms. The circadian rhythm metrics showed regularity and structure in the participant’s heart rate data with a mesor of 70.46 and acrophase of 0.6, in which these values also correlate negatively with the Perceived Stress domains. High values of mesor or androphese tend towards average or low perceived stress). The participant’s heart rate data indicates relatively high or average stress.

Given the data of Circadian Rhythm Metrics:
Interdaily stability =  Interdaily stability in heart rate
Intradaily variability = average heart rate across days
Parametric and non-parametric measures of the circadian rhythm are essential to analyze these rhythmic patterns, these values can provide insight into the pariticipants behaviors and perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported metrics, such as sleep statistics and circadian rhythm metrics derived from wearable activity data, are critical in understanding the participant's lifestyle and behaviors.

The participant's self-reported sleep metrics, as measured by the Fitbit and subjective experience of sleep quality, show a moderate relationship between the participant’s perceived stress and their self-reported sleep quality. The participant's reported sleep statistics show that the participant typically has sleep durations of 6 hours and sleep start times that are regular, the participant sleeps from around 1:00 AM, mediators of total sleep and 18.45 AM. This variability in sleep start times reflects the consistency of the sleep schedule.

Wearable data metrics show a subjective experience of sleep, this implies lower perceived stress compared with a low of -0.24 Z-Scored sleep Duration and sleep metrics indicate subjective sleep quality. However, the participant’s rest sleep start times and sleep duration of around 6 hours and 50 minutes per night are associated with higher perceived stress, the  Z-score sleep statistics and  indicates poor sleep quality.

For most of these survey scores and wearable metrics are accompanied by statistics regarding the participant’s population and ranking. These metrics are composed of:

1. Sleep Statistics:
    - Nightly sleep 
    -  '6:50 hours',6:00 AM 
    - 7:59 PM,8:00 PM 
    - Self-reported sleep metrics: 
    - Nightly sleep statistics: 
    - Average sleep duration  '6 hours 50 minutes', 
    - Average sleep duration '5 hours 11  minutes'.
    - Wearable sleep duration: '6 hours 
    - 'P90' 
    -  '18:30'
    - 'P50':  '6 hours'
    -  'Z-score': -0.44 
    -  'C50' of 6:00 
    -2.

2 Aggregated Hourly Heart Rate Data:
    - For each hour of the day (24 hours), the participant’s heart rate deviation from their mesor is calculated:

    - 'Parametric': 
    - Z-Score:  23 
    * relative to 23.68

3. Circadian Rhythm metrics:
    - Amplitude: 5.27 
    - Parametric measures indicate a relatively low-stress state
    * Regular sleep and lower sleep fragmentation

4. Daily activity patterns from wearable heart rate data indicate moderate physical activity and stressful behaviors.

On the one hand, the self-reported sleep metrics and wearable-derived sleep statistics show that they tend to have relatively stable and consistent sleep patterns, on the other hand, the participant tends to have relatively low and variable sleep durations. For example, the participant’s nightly sleep duration is around 7-8 hours with  Z-Score around -0.5 indicating a relatively average sleep pattern.

Their sleep statistics show that they tend to have a relatively early sleep start time and end sleep time around 1:30-4:30 AM/PM with an average sleep duration around 190 minutes. The participant also reports a relatively low sleep quality, and has low sleep quality, as indicated by their sleep quality score in the lower 50% of the population distribution. In contrast, their self-reported sleep metrics are more consistent with their own perception of low sleep quality, not being a perfect predictor of their own stress level.

On the other hand, the participant’s wearable-derived circadian rhythm metrics show that they have a relatively low mesor, and low amplitude. This pattern indicates that the participant experiences lower-than-average physiological stress levels with elevated circadian rhythm stability. For example, the participant’s mean heart rate deviation is around 0.5 standard deviations from their resting heart rate of 49.8 - 53.4 - 52.3 for a male - indicating relatively normal physiological responses to everyday activities.

The participant’s behavioral data shows a significant correlation between their heart rate variability and their self-reported physical activity levels. The data show that they tend to engage in relatively low to moderate levels of physical activity, as measured by Fitbit and wearable devices. This suggests that participant is more likely to experience stress when engaging in physical activity. The participant’s circadian rhythm features relatively high amplitude, and the values are more variable during certain times of day when other is more low, which is suggestive of the participant being over stressed and the stress puts in the lower  which suggests participant might likely experience more stress than average. Their daily sleep duration values are an average as indicated by a  Z-score of -0.13 for their sleep and 20 for their sleep when analyzed across population distributions. 

In terms of evaluating stress levels, the combined evidence from all behavioral and physiological metrics, we can conclude that this participant is experiencing relatively normal levels of stress and fall within a low distribution. 

A deeper analysis of this shows that if anything they do tend towards evening/ late. Overall multimodal summary shows  the results so far do indicate a low level of stress-re this may be mediated by related outcomes in terms the stressor or PSCE NPRtogroup. Overall we can conclude this individual is experiencing stress levels lower from average values analyzed from distribution of the entire population.

 
The aggregated hour-by-hour heart rate data from wearable shows that typical physiological responses to stress vary by time. They show clear pattern differences between stress and non-stressed states. Not only aggregated value showed an increase in the early morning at the hour before mid-morning.

Given the evidence of different behavioral and physiological metrics, an analysis shows a low-stress participant due to stability from correlated overall stress measures that likely would place them at the lower end of the stress spectrum for this individual.

 
The final conclusion we can draw of their overall perceived stress levels indicate that this participant would likely experience relatively low or moderate stress levels in comparison to the study population, given the data analyzed which will categorize a low stress individual.

Given the sleep duration and the activity level, it is likely that the participant has average or higher than average stress level (PSS=50). The combined analysis of the participant’s self-reported data, behavioral, and physiological metrics, suggest a median stress level as reflected by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). 

The values (heart rate activity) of the mean heart rate suggest regular patterns of the daily variation of physiological activity, and are relatively high, especially at night. These values can be interpreted as indicative of physiological arousal and can be correlated with the PSS scores.

Sleep quality is not measurable through wearables but the self-reported values suggest that the participant is getting enough rest and sleep but it is not restful (low Z-score relative to the study population).

Given the analysis, the PSS score of the participant is relatively low or median compared to the study population. This is reflected in various sleep quality, physiological poor behaviors such as oragan and a higher resting heart rate. With the overall evidence available, the data supports the PSS domains indicating higher perceived stress and stress-related behaviors. Concluding the analysis, the participant likely has a PSS score in the bottom of the distribution.

The participant's PSS Score can be classified as belonging to the bottom half or bottom 50% based on correlations between PSS and behavioral/physiological metrics. Low correlations with PSS domains and correlations with PSS domains are negative. Moreover, lower daily variation of heart rate can be linked to stress levels and elevated daytime sympathetic activity can be an indication of stress reactions to relaxation behaviors. The correlation of -0.15 for self-esteem and stress relations can indicate relatively moderate level of PSS and lower levels of stress and stress reactions.

The participant's stress levels can be inferred from their correlations with the PSS Score and their sleep and physical and sedentary behaviors. Low Z-scores (<-1.0) for sleep and sleep duration suggest that they might have lower stress reactions compared to their peers and might experience lower stress levels. However the correlations and correlations provide evidence that the participant can be classified as having low stress reactions to their stress reactions. The evidence of stress relations indicates relatively low stress reactions to their behaviors and correlations of  they can be relatively stable.

44872,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant's data presents a complex picture of their psychological state, perceived stress, and behaviors. The self-reported surveys indicate a low depressive symptom burden, as evidenced by the CES-D score of 5.0, and a low Z-score of -0.86, relative to the study population. The trait anxiety and non-parametric measures of interdaily stability and circadian rhythm metrics are relatively low, and also relatively low and non-parametric measures show some level of regularity and also relatively low and less sleep and sleep metrics and no emotional disturbance and moderate anxiety. In the combined survey and wearable metrics of sleep and cardiovascular data, metrics of sleep and rest and also from heart rate variability provide clear insights and critical behavioral data. Sleep patterns, as well as the average sleep duration and the time and also heart rate and circadian rhythm-related sleep, as well as data from the Fitbit wearable, as well as daily aggregated hourly data from the hourly and sleep schedule and diary or sleeping and also sleep and rest schedule support and activity data including time spent watching TV and videos and non- Parametric and Cosinor analysis. Also, the median sleep duration and sleep and rest schedule and time spent in various activities including the time spent in different activities provide insights into the behaviors of the participant.

The participant’s sleep statistics show that they are getting, on average  a sleep duration of 6 hours and 58 minutes, as well as a sleep start time of around 21:38:55 and spend a relatively consistent time in bed each day and sleep and  most night sleep of around 6 hours and 45 minutes and sleep around 21:38:55 and sleep end time of around 21:38:55 and sleep on a regular schedule around 21-12 hours and  around 4 hours before midnight and the average sleep time was of 6 hours and 45 minutes and also average rest and heart rate and heart rate metrics from the Fitbit provide more insights into daily and hourly behaviors and around sleep schedule regularity and regular sleep and daily sleep and sleep activity patterns.

Their physical activity level are indicated by the aggregated hourly heart rate data. Most of the hours are within a relatively low deviation range of -10 and +5 to -1 and 13 +1 or 5 PM hours low for most  hours and the lowest at 9 PM with 18 and also no activity and at night the values increase slightly till 6 and 6 and also 9 and 12 and more elevated after 9 with a deviation of 6 and mean at rest of 48 and then values of heart rate elevated after  noon till evening with a gradual increase at and peak around 15-18 with a highest average of the day.

Circadian rhythm metrics show a moderate amplitude and relatively regular sleep-wake cycle of sleep over the study period. Cosinor analysis provides evidence of well behaviors habits with sleep duration of around 6 hours and 45 minutes on the weekends and relatively sleepiest weekends. The cosinor and parametric measures show amplitude at MESOR and it correlates with behaviors to regular sleep-wake behaviors.

Physiological and behavioral data from the wearable Fitbit and survey self report metrics provide insights into the participant’s behaviors and psychological state. The resting heart rate is 48 beats per minute and well within a relatively low range. The participant reported to have had a low level of activities and behaviors like exercising or had irregular sleep patterns with sleep start times around 22:00 hours or later and had relatively short sleep duration with this metrics accompanying an abnormally high Z-score and reported a sleep quality of 6 out of 21 and Z-score is -0.19 relative to the study population. The participant reported relatively low levels of activities like exercising and physical activity. The participant’s average sleep duration is relatively low at around 23:30 and sleep at relatively late hours of the day around 22:00 hours and has a sleep-wake up time around 7:38 AM/PM and has a relatively low sleep schedule, and bedtime around 04:00 hours. 

The participant’s psychological state is also marked by a moderate PSS score of   and relatively high levels of self-esteem and trust in interpersonal relationships are found with low and anxious in Z-scores of traits such that anxiety and happiness and well-being and relatively higher levels of activity in socializing context as work, in surveys of behavioral type.

94641,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant's data reveals a complex interplay of psychological, behavioral, and physiological factors that contribute to their perceived stress levels. The self-reported surveys indicate a CES-D score of 29.0, with a Z-score of , a relatively high score, indicating higher-than-average stress, given the population's mean), indicating higher-than-average perceived stress. The high score on this depressive symptoms and the relatively lower self-reported sleep quality, generally suggests an overall elevated level of stress as reported by these survey instruments.

The data collected from the participant's self-report survey and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics provide a comprehensive view of their psychological state and behavioral patterns. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) domains indicate a moderate level of perceived stress, and the overall self-report survey and wearable-derived metrics suggest that the participant experiences moderate stress. The sleep metrics show a relatively consistent sleep pattern, but with sleep duration variability. The median sleep duration is slightly lower than the population average. The participant also reports sleep quality as relatively poor, but the PSS score is not excessively high, with reports from surveys and the mean stress levels experienced relatively low, reinforcing a strong relation between sleep quality and psychological stress that the PSS reported from these metrics.

Given heart rate data aggregated by time of day, the deviation of the mean heart rate from the mesor suggests a pattern of stress varying with time of day; given that these values represent typical cardiovascular activity levels and are not specific to individual dates. It suggests higher activity in early morning to late evening periods. Heart rate analysis by time of day shows that there is variation with a peak at late morning and late evening periods; typically more stress after late evening periods. Overall, the participant’s combined data suggests relatively low perceived stress, given by such metric indications of stress levels overall behavior related metrics, and the population’s overall distribution scores. A participant’s overall scores would fall in the lower half of distribution scores concerning the population. 

The wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics also support the notion that the participant likely has a stress level in the bottom 50 of the population distribution given their responses on the perceived stress scale. The participant’s overall ranking of PSS would be in the bottom_50 of the population distribution given their overall perceived stress levels. The overall impression of their behavioral and physiological metrics suggests that the participant likely has a relatively low stress score compared to the study population stress average.

Given this evidence, it indicates the participant’s stress levels would likely be in the bottom 50% range relative to the study population distribution. the Z-score comparing the participants overall ranking in the population and overall perceived stress are suggestions to support that the participant would place in the bottom half.

Further review is needed to fully capture to cor relational impacts if I entirely miss or misunderstand such behaviors especially concerning sleep, stress and stress; but suggests are in bottom half:

72806,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant's self-reported surveys and wearable-derived metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of their psychological state, perceived stress, and behaviors. Notably, the participant's CES-D score of 5 indicates a minimal depressive symptom burden, their STAI score of 33 indicates an relatively low anxiety proneness. The participant's PSS score correlation with the STAI score is 0.31. The participant’s STAI score of 33 is slightly below the mean and indicates relatively low anxiety and stress.

The sleep metrics indicate the participant sleeps 7 hours and 34 minutes on average, with a median sleep duration of 7 hours and 43 minutes sleep and an average sleep duration of 7 hours and 43 minutes. The participant’s sleep is accompanied by a self-reported sleep metric to accompany the wearable recorded metrics and the sleep duration is accompanied by a self-reported sleep metric to indicate the subjective experience of sleep.

Sleep metrics are also accompanied by self-reported sleep metrics in the surveys to indicate the subjective experience of sleep. The sleep metrics indicate a relatively consistent sleep schedule. The sleep metrics indicate the sleep quality is good sleep quality is good.

Furthermore, the sleep metrics indicate that the participant sleeps an average amount of 7 hours and 34 minutes. This average sleep duration is accompanied by a self-reported sleep metric that the participant sleeps  average for 7-8 minutes, so the sleep duration is of good quality. Furthermore, the participant’s sleep is relatively consistent, but the sleep start time varies. On average, the sleep start time is around midnight, but it can vary. The sleep duration does suggest good sleep quality. Moreover, the sleep metrics indicate that the participant’s sleep is of good quality.

The hourly heart rate data indicates the participant’s physiological response to stress at different times of the day. On analyzing the heart rate data, the participant’s heart rate variability, and daily rhythms, this data can indicate, participant’s physiological stress ands  his emotional state.

On average, the participant’s heart rate is lower in the morning and and the highest values are in the late afternoon and early evening. Considering the participant’s resting heart rate, these deviations can indicate the participant’s typical daily heart rate patterns.

The participant's heart rate circadian rhythm metrics, including the parametric measures (e.g., MESOR,, amplitude) from cosinor analysis and non-parametric measures (e.g., interdaily stability,intradaily variability) indicate regularity and structure in the participant’s heart rate-based circadian rhythm across the entire recording period. The values indicate relatively low stress and indicate a stable circadian rhythm, and lower stress levels.

Upon analyzing the correlation values between the metrics and the participant's PSS score, the significant correlations include the positive correlations between the stress metrics and sleep, the lowest values are for the hourly correlations between PSS and stress metrics including sleep and Heart rate data.

Given the evidence and the participant's wearable data, the participant's sleep patterns are relatively consistent with a medium-sized negative z-score of -0.47 for the participant's sleep and also a sleep start time of 22:03, indicates relatively late start times. Furthermore, the participant’s sleep duration and sleep patterns are of relatively low, medium negative deviation of -0.15 for sleep and -0.17 for start times from the study population’s mean; -0.68 for -1.23 for the sleep duration and start times.


The participant's data in the given JSON format indicates a mix of positive and some not so positive behaviors. On the basis of the participant’s survey answers and the correlations between metrics and PSS scores, this analysis aims to determine if the participant would likely be at the top or bottom half of the population distribution based on their stress levels.


The participant’s sleep statistics indicate that they get an average of 7 hours and 37 minutes of sleep. This indicates that they are not sleep-deprived. The participant’s data also indicates a preference for watching and reading at late hours or early evening.


In analyzing the participant’s survey data alongside wearable-derived metrics and correlations with the perceived stress score, the participant's overall stress level, and stress-ca--kthn can indicate whether they are likely to experience stress or stress in the lower half of the distribution. With these metrics and overall analysis in consideration, the analysis can determine the likelihood that the participant would experience stress in the top 50% or the lower half.

The participant’s sleep statistics, given by the wearable and self-reported sleep metrics such as duration and start time, given to indicate the participant’s sleep and sleep statistics such as mean and standard deviation. The average time the participant sleeps and the sleep start and given sleep statistics are crucial in understanding the participants overall stress levels.

Given the results of the CombinedInput the participant’s overall perceived stress level can be assessed and stress and all other metrics.

The results indicate that participant experiences relatively elevated stress levels. The relationship between the PSS domains and the values and the participant’s behaviors and physiological metrics is crucial. The analysis of the participant’s results show that sleep and heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics are correlated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the participant’s stress state and behaviors.

The participant’s sleep and heart rate metrics suggest that sleep duration and sleep time is relatively stable. The average sleep time is approximately 6-8 hours and the sleep duration and the sleep quality are relatively stable. However, the participant’s self-reported sleep metrics indicate some discrepancies with the objective Fitbit data, and the participant's subjective experience of their sleep. These values indicate regularity and structure of the participant’s heart rate-based circadian rhythm across the recording period.

According to the wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics the results suggest the participant experiences relatively low stress levels.

More explicitly and most reliably, given the participant's data and evidence supported by the data and correlations between the survey scores.

Overall it appears the participant is more likely to have a low stress or average stress level rather than a very high stress level and this is supported by the evidence of low or median PSS scores correlating with significant correlations (pearsson correlation >=0.05) and correlations between (PearSS PSS) values.


The daily sleep patterns show that the participant sleeps relatively long hours, but does so with irregularities that do not affect the overall sleep quality. Some metrics show moderate (for a normal or average stress participant) sleep quality levels in this participant. Daily routine activities show the participant engages in different routines with adequate motivation and social interactions.


Upon reviewing physiological data it suggests participant typically engages in moderate intensity activity levels by time of day. The participant’s heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics show a relatively stable and regular circadian rhythm pattern over all days.


Based on all evidence from the multimodal data analysis, it is clear the participant does not exhibit a stress level that would be expected from a participant in a stressful environment (PSS) but exhibits an 50 to 60% relatively moderate perceived stress. Based on an overall ranking of PSS scores (bottom 50%), as determined by the PSS domains, in contrast to the rest of the distribution (lower or average perceived stress). The correlations between the PSS domains) and the data from surveys, self-reported sleep metrics, a relatively average perceived stress participant, it seems clear the participant’s overall perceived stress would likely place them closer to the top or the lower parts of the stress population distribution.

{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""}

With the comprehensive data provided, including the PSS score, the sleep patterns and wearable-derived physiological metrics reflect a lower perceived stress as defined by the PSS scale. The participant's sleep patterns show some variations, but overall the data suggests a relatively normal and low-stress life as defined by the data. 

The participant’s daily activities, the data on heart rate and physiological metrics shows a relatively normal autonomic and daily stress level,The participant’s overall physical activity levels are within the normal range as indicated by the Z-scores. 

The data on hourly heart rate deviations and the deviations from the resting heart rate data don’t show specific trends but overall the participant is not experiencing unusually high stress in terms of physiological metrics.

Given the comprehensive dataset provided including the wearables data the participant’s PSS scores would place them at the lower half or the bottom of the study population distribution of the PSS scale and thus:

{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
44927,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant's data suggests a complex interplay of behavioral and physiological metrics that convey a lifestyle marked by relatively stable sleep-wake times and aggressive behavioral traits in spite of somewhat non specific correlations to the stress levels as measured by the PSS. The combined perspective will require a careful consideration to determine whether these metrics signify correlations in behavioral patterns of either correlations between, higher or lower stress scoring. 
The participants, data suggests correlations of various survey scores,and corrlations between measures. To provide a better understanding of perceived stress it is imporotot gian to detect whether these stress level would indicate whether the participant's stress level is in the top or bottom  half of the study population distribution based on their stress levels as measured by the PSS.

A holistic analysis of the evidence suggests that understanding of stress indicates that the participant’s overall psychological stress would place them in the lower half of the study population in the perceived stress scale,as scored by the PSS, of the population,or the median perceived stress levels. These behavioral and physiological data, suggest correlations, a lifestyle that is not conducive to undue stress levels and reflects habits conducive to stress levels.

The evidence from correlations also shows that the pariticipant’s resting heart rate is within normal ranges, the Z-Score value suggests a high stress score compared to the population, the pariticipant's average sleep duration is lower than in the lower half of the population, along with relatively lower sleep quality (short sleep duration and more awakenings and lower sleep quality) suggests an average sleep quality. Since sleep start times are also tracked, sleep quality still does not seem to indicate undue stress. Further more,it seems sleep quality is not measured via wearables, the evidence still seems to lean to suggest low to moderate stress level given the behavioral metrics.

Given the evidence, it is more indicative of low to moderate perceived stress levels which are reflected in the lower half of the population (bottom 50%) and the participant is more likely to have a stress level in the bottom half of the population distribution,when stress leve ls are ordered from lowest to highest, with regards to PSS scores.

Given these observations, the behavioral and physiological metrics show patterns of a relatively average sleep quality , yet lower than expected sleep duraion and with a relatively lower sleep timing suggests an efficient stress coping mechanism and also an active lifestyle. Evidence suggests that that the pariticipant is likely in the bottom half of the population with regards to their stress levels as measured by the PSS domains, and the pariticipant is likely to be at the lower 50% including the median percentile), the participant pariticipant likely has a stress level score which would place them at the lower half of the study population.

The overall behavioral and physiological data alongside evidence of a relatively low or median score (bottom 50th percentile including the median), if any is available, suggests that the participant’s overall stress level would likely place them at the lower half of the study population. With regards to perceived stress it would suggest the paritcipant is more prone to lower stress levels. Given these evidence and based on the indications given by the correlations and the overall behavioral and phisiological profile suggests that the participant is more prone to have an average stress level. Hence,the following classification can be concluded:

A closer look at the wearable data the devices metrics data illustrates a trend, in the people’in Sleep statistics analysis: the participant’s mean sleep duration is  there, correlating with their Z-score. The average daily deviation of the mean heart rate from the wearable indicates physiological and psychological patterns. This heart rate variability data should be considered alongside the daily variation data to detect patterns of stress, patterns of daily heart rate and daily circadian rhythm metrics of correlation circadian rhyth problematic patterns,The most relevant factor to a multimodal behavioral and psychological analysis is the overall assessment of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and its correlation with daily activities, behaviors of and physiological metrics. Correlations especially sleep and physiological data are essential. These correlation provide a powerful insight into how the participant's behaviors of and correlate with the PSS score. The survey scores also include multiple psychological traits and behaviors that allow for a deeper understanding of the participant's profile, requiring a low or high PSS score.

The wearable data - including sleep duration, daytime activity and nighttime activity and heart rate variability can provide insights to the behavioral data. Specifically the deviations of the mean heart rate and the daily sleep patterns are essential metrics to understand the behavioral and physiological metrics that can be linked with the perceived stress.

Sleep statistics and sleep quality metrics show that the participant’s average sleep duration is relatively normal, the Z-score for sleep is near -0.25 in this case it is slightly better. The relation of the PSS score and Sleep quality and daytime behavior are assessed through surveys the score of these surveys are:

The combined input shows participant data from various sources: self-report surveys, data from wearable devices - Fitbits. These data indicate a complex psychological and behavioral profile for analysis: The perceived stress scale (PSS) and lifestyle data provide a comprehensive overview of the participant’s behaviors - the self-report survey and wearable device data allow for an understanding of psychological and behavioral patterns, overview of PSS domains).

An aggregate of physiological and behavioral data provide essential context to interpret meaningful patterns of daily variation, and stress patterns.

Sleep statistics and self-reported sleep metrics are essential metrics in this study. The participant’s sleep metrics show patterns of physiological and behavioral data. Sleep duration and sleep start time variability data provide an overview of the participant’s sleep patterns. The night sleep statistics regarding total sleep duration and sleep start time are essential metrics for assessing physiological arousal and daily stress.

Analyzing and the hourly heart rate variability metrics shows a more normal physiological response. A clear and structured analysis shows sleep patterns are evidence of stress in a student’s life and demonstrate how daily behaviors may lead to higher stress.

Further inspection of daily behaviors is essential. This combined analysis aims to evaluate evidence that PSS scores indicate lower or higher stress.

46365,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant's data presents a complex picture of their psychological state, perceived stress, and behaviors. The Self-Reported Surveys section reveals a CES-D score of 12.0, which is relatively low compared to the study population (Z-score: -0.14). The participant's resting heart rate (recorded by the Fitbit wearable) was 55. The Z-score for this metric was -0.45. The correlation between this and the PSS score is -0.28. Self-reported metrics also included survey sleep metrics, which is isubjective. 
Further analysis of this sleep metric found the participant typically going to bed between the 10 hours and 12:00 - 13:00 to 14:00 13:00 to 7:00 AM - 8:00 PM. The most salient feature of the combined sleep and heart rate data and the associated sleep duration (measured by the wearable and also reported by the surveys sleep metrics) was between 7.3 - 10.9 hours. This sleep pattern reflects a relatively stable circadian rhythm. A  standard circadian rhythm was measured by the Fitbit sleep data and the non-parametric circadian rhythm metrics showed interdaily stability of 0.47 and a moderate intraday variability of 0.43. This suggests the participant has relatively moderate stress-free and structured lifestyle with regards to their stress and stress-related behaviors.

The sleep data revealed the participant typically slept around 9.00 PM and had a sleep duration of  around 7-8 hours. The Fitbit recorded a sleep duration of around 7.5 hours and  the self-reported typical sleep satisfaction was relatively consistent with this (Z-score: -1.23). The sleep metrics also revealed that the participant slept a self reported typical duration of 7-9 hours (nightly) and had a somewhat consistent sleep schedule but had fluctuations in sleep patterns during the night. The mean sleep duration was associated with a positive correlation of the correlation of 0.18 and the PSS score. 

The Fitbit sleep recorded metrics were found to be associated to stress-related correlations to indicate whether the participant’s sleep patterns may reflect high stress periods. Given the stress and fatigue levels of the participant and we can analyze this,Correlation of r = -0.18 with significant correlations (-) between The sleep satisfaction correlation is also significant) sleep satisfaction (-.35) correlations of r = -.21). Relatingly significant were sleep satisfaction metrics correlations of  Z-score = .61 & correlations found correlations of Z = -0.35 and stress was relatively low and a low Z-score correlation of -0.65 sleep duration, correlate stress and heart rate metrics not measured via wearables of (-.56 Z-Score). Physiological and behavioral data showed normal stability for most features measured (e.g. sleep). A Z-Score for the value of the metric sleep duration relative to the population (-1.23) and (-0.44) for the value of the sleep metric indicated low or average perceived stress. Based on this sleep data and correlations between the value and the PSS score (r = -0.19) and the Z-Score of the sleep metric relative to the study population, and the Z-Score of the value of the sleep metric relative to the study population and the Z-Score of the value of the metric and a non-parametric measures (e.g., MESOR,acrophase) from cosinor analysis, a  circadian rhythm feature derived from the heart rate-based circadian rhythm across the entire recording period and summary-level circadian rhythm features derived from the heart rate data. The participant’s self-reported sleep metrics were found to be relatively correlated to the PSS score (r = -0.34). Considering sleep and sleep behavior, this suggests that the participant's average sleep duration was relatively consistent and that sleep was initiated and terminated around the 9 PM - 0:00 AM.

Further analysis of the sleep statistics revealed that the participant typically slept for around 7 hours, with a relatively stable sleep duration of around 7-8 hours and a sleep satisfaction score of Z = 1.2) relative to the study population and the Z-Score of the value of the metric relative to the study population. The Z-Score of this sleep metric was -0.45 indicating that the participant experienced relatively low stress and relatively low or average stress was low or non-significant (p > .05). The correlations between the sleep and the PSS score are weak and low so we have low confidence that this participant has relatively moderate stress level as their average heart rate shows.

The sleep duration and the sleep start time data indicates that the participant typically followed a regular sleep schedule with some variability, night-to-night, given the standard deviation of the mean heart rate (Z = 2.5) of the heart rate-based sleep and a sleep duration based on Z-Score. The sleep satisfaction correlated relatively to the PSS domains indicating that this aspect of life stress as being somewhat or very low. However somestress and fatigue correlated with stress (significant at the  P < .05) negatively correlated with the  in a pattern of daily heart rate circadian rhythm reflecting regularity and structure. Analysis of the participant's Z-scored heart rate and heart rate variability metrics correlated with perceived stress and the daily and sleep patterns suggests patterns of low stress and stress being experienced.

Overall the Fitbit data showed typical daily stress and physical activity patterns as can be expected of normal distribution of similar individuals. Circadian rhythm metrics indicated regular patterns. Thus it seems we can conclude the participant likely has a PSS score at the:

58196,24.0,0.8160621761658031,"The participant's multimodal data reveals a complex interplay between psychological traits,, self-reported behaviors, and wearable-derived physiological metrics. The relationship between the participant's perceived stress and their responses to the surveys show a strong correlation with the perceived stress scale, demonstrating a significant association with the participant’s psychological state and behaviors.

The analysis of the participant's self-reported sleep metrics in conjunction with the Fitbit data recorded sleep statistics show significant correlations with the sleep duration and sleep start time, and the rest of the recorded sleep patterns. The Z-score of -0.76 for sleep duration indicates relatively low sleep, the participant’s recording of sleep duration is on the lower end of the distribution. A lower sleep quality is reflected in the PSQ correlations indicating relatively low stress.

The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows a deviation from the mean heart rate, the mesor aggregated across all recorded days. The participant’s heart rate typically demonstrates elevated cardiovascular activity levels,  the greatest and lowest values of the mean deviation of the heart rate from the mesor represent periods of high and low cardiovascular activity. The participant’s resting heart rate is reflected in their relatively low Z-score of -0.56. 

Given the participant’s relatively high sleep quality and sleep metrics, the low stress may be inferred. It's likely given the heart rate data in the participant is not associated with perceived stress or relatively high. The analysis indicates low stress given the sleep statistics.

Considering the participant’s sleep patterns, low sleep duration may be inferred as related to stress sleep deprivation behaviors with a low sleep quality and to contributing to higher stress levels. This pattern shows stress behavior being influenced by a lack of sleep and resulting stress coping behaviors. The participant's self-reported sleep metrics also correlates to perceived stress behaviors based on the data.

Overall the participant’s high self-reported sleep metrics and lower sleep statistics could contribute to stress levels as reflected by their behaviors to sleep and sleep habits and to perceived stress given their overall state of psychological. Overall it seems plausible that the participant’s sleep behavior including both quality sleep metrics such a sleep onset time during night to accompany the subjective experience of participant and associated low stress behavior reflected in perceived stress behaviors patterns could contribute to elevated perceived stress perception in the low-stress populations.

Their heart rhythm-based circadian metrics also suggests a reasonable level of daily variation with overall stress-free activities, though low-stress times do not exist.

Considering their overall psychological and behavioral patterns from both the self-reported data and the wearable device-derived data a ranking could be concluded.

The participant’s overall perceived stress could place in either the top 50% and bottom50%. A relationship between sleep statistics and hourly heart rate deviations show that it could contribute to an overall feeling of relatively moderate stress as reported from other participants.

The following statements can conclude:

Overall, the participant's data suggests a moderate level of perceived stress, with a notable level of anxiety and depressive symptoms. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is correlated with several metrics, including sleep patterns, circadian rhythms and physiological arousal.

The participant's sleep patterns, as recorded, are characterized by a median sleep duration of approximately 6 hours, with a sleep start time, and standard deviation, and sleep start times, suggest poor sleep quality and disturbances. The mean sleep duration of approximately 6 hours is significantly low compared to the population's standards, the participant tends to sleep late, with a sleep start time that is later than average. The participant is reported to have a lower subjective sleep quality, with a deviation of the reported sleep times is relatively low. The deviations are correlated to sleep quality with sleep less than average.

Self-reported sleep metrics accompany the wearable metrics to assess subjective sleep experiences, including sleep quality, with heart rate-based circadian rhythm features and regularity in sleeping schedules. These metrics reveal poor sleep quality with a relatively low sleep satisfaction. On the other hand the participant reports relatively low sleep dissatisfaction despite the metrics suggesting poor sleep quality.

The self-reported sleep satisfaction surveys show an overall sleep disturbance and lack of sleep, with a significant standard deviation and disturbance. The sleep quality survey responses show sleep disturbances. and disturbances of sleep. .

The wearable activity data, is aggregated and shows patterns of daily activity and physiological arousal. The mean heart rate deviation is indicative of the heart rate activity,and physiological stress response to daily activities with highest heart rate activity during morning hours and lowest heart rate during night hours. Heart rate deviation data suggests significant physiological response and daily activity patterns with daily stress periods and relatively low heart rate during sleeping hours.

Circadian rhythm metrics and heart rate variability suggest irregular sleep schedule and sleep disturbances with a relatively higher circadian rhythm mesor, and relatively lower amplitude. This could indicate a stress level and poor sleep quality with an unstable circadian rhythm and a relatively lower circadian rhythm stability. The rhythm metrics suggest that the participant experiences stress and has significant correlations with the PSS scores. Sleep metrics show a correlation of stress-related behaviors.

Further investigation into the participant's physical health, it appears that he has a relatively higher cardiovascular activity than the average participant with a resting heart rate of 62. The participant's heart rate is lowest at 12:00 AM. The time with the highest cardiovascular activity is at 6:00 PM with the participant experiencing a relatively high level of physiological stress. This is also indicative of the participant experiencing stress-related stress with a stress-mangut daring an attempt stressor relaxing an attempt. The stress-related behavior of the participant could be viewed as related to the overall stress.

Overall, the participant's stress levels seem moderate to relatively high. 

They score a 34.0,Anxiety on the STAI scale and 65 on the Trait anxiety scale. They are above average on self-reported measures of mental health. Their Rosenberg self-esteem is average, with a score of  They have a relatively low score of 19 on the depression scale with a significant correlation to  their PSS scores of -0.15. The depression score is within normal limits. 

The participant’s wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics show that they experience significant stress level with a high PSS score.

Based on the analysis of all evidence available I conclude that the participant's PSS score is likely to be classified as the bottom 50% with regard to their perceived stress.

62246,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"Based on the provided dataset, a holistic analysis of the participant’s psychological and behavioral patterns reveals several key insights. The participant’s self-reported surveys indicate that the participant is not experiencing elevated perceived stress, though there are some signs of mild stress being reported through subjective experience of the participant and correlated wearables and aggregated heart rate data. 

The wearable Fitbit data provides additional context, further indicating some areas of daily stress and patterns of physiological arousal and provides insights into perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Specifically, the participant's combined PSS score has significant correlations with physiological metrics derived from the Fitbit data - for example - there is an aggregated hourly deviation of the mean heart rate, which when evaluated relative to the participant's resting heart rate, indicate some areas of potential daily stress as well as physiological arousal. The mean heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics show regular patterns across the study population, those that reflect daily stress and anxiety. 

Given these correlations between the values and the PSS score, it can be inferred that perceived stress -as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale- should place the participant at either the top or bottom half of the distribution. 

The participant's self-reported psychological and behavioral metrics show a mix of elevated stress and more enjoyable activities - with regards to the 25 percentiles, it has a corresponding score of 45th percent ile the Z-score of -0.96. On a scale from 0-60, with higher values indicating greater stress burden, it has a moderate to significant correlation. 

The participant's Fitbit-derived sleep metrics suggest somewhat consistent yet variable patterns. The median duration of nightly sleep is approximately 7 hours and 39 minutes. The participant’s resting heart rate was found to be around 57 beats per minute,with a standard deviation of about 10 beats per minute. Interpret these values in the context of the Z-score relative to the population mean of the overall population’s mean and the Z-score relative to the participant’s population’s mean to infer patterns of stress and stress. Given the correlations to PSS domains and relative stress score, one can interpret the overall data to indicate whether perceived stress or lack of sleep, physical activities appear to exacerbate mild pattern of stress of the participant.

The participant's combined self-report survey data, built metrics that assess psychological traits as depression, self-esteem and other social interactions, built around data that could aid interpretation. Given these measures and the correlation of perceived stress as correlated to overall population distribution, one can conclude the stress domains correlation and stress domains correlation. 

The participant has a median PSS score that would likely put them at the lower half of the distribution. Given that that one can infer a medium stress due to patterns of sleep and physiological data,” one can conclude that the participant likely has a low or median PSS score of the population distribution.

From the survey data, the participant's perceived stress score indicates moderate levels of stress (as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) domains), relative to the population norms and the general population norms.

The overall stress levels experienced by the participant, as suggested by the Z-Score of the PSS domains) can be evaluated as moderately stressed.

The correlations with other variables including trust, listening to music, internet usage can be noted but should be interpreted cautiously.

The participant’s daily routines as evidenced by Fitbit data show regular wake up times, and daily activities. The Heart Rate Variability (HRV) demonstrates variation when aggregated over 24 hours, this correlation would help to support the evaluation for stress. The relationship to stress is partial supported by daily activties data.

Upon analyzing and compiling the numerous behavioral features, including their explicit stress scores for low stress situations (i.e., via PSS psychological traits),the student might be low on stressed.


Looking at the holistic features and evidence the Participant is likely at the low end for stress.


The wearable metrics are limited for daily and seasonal fluctuations but these show variability in the the physiological metrics and this participant, they seem to be generally low stress or average. The daily behavioral and physiological pattern fluctuations are therefore, an essential aspect of daily life.


Given that the average daily and the overall behavioral and physiological data, the analysis indicates that this participant has lower perceived stress levels since the features extracted,they should show the participant's average to the overall population.

For example, the participant’s score of 51 on the STAI-Trait scale, and a 28. on the SCSQ-8 scale indicate moderate levels of stress and anxiety. This suggests the participant experiences higher levels of anxiety-proneness but are not completely overwhelmed. Furthermore, the participant reports relatively low frequency of sleep disturbance, although having poor sleep quality, which is supported by the wearable Fitbit sleep data showing a low sleep duration and disturbance in sleep patterns. The Fitbit data suggests that they are not a morning lark, shown by their natural sleep patterns and they sleep late into the night. They experience typical disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle. The data on circadian rhthmics suggest an irregular but regular sleep-wake pattern,.

The analysis of the combined data suggests that behavioral physiological patterns, and stress are interrelated and stress experience may influence many factors that involve behavioral habit. It appears that physiological pattern interdaily variability patterns may indicate perceived stress in relation with behaviors that are measured with wearables and self-reported and Fitbit data for analytics on actual metrics of sleep.

Activities engaged by the participant such as time spent viewing or browsing on TV (r = 0.08) were positively correlated (r = 0.31) with daily stress behaviors (r = -0.15) but this correlation is modest at best.

Wearable activity metrics are another area of investigation into the participant's daily stress levels and stress behaviors. The data on hourly heart rate deviations suggests the participant experiences some stress around the 6-7 am period and experiences stress during this time as indicated by relatively elevated deviations in the participant's heart rate, particularly in the 6:00 AM - 12:00 PM time frame.

The self-reported surveys offer a glimpse into the participant's psychological state, and mental health. Given the provided data, the participant appears to have relatively average perceived stress based on the PSS score due to the following insights. 

Given the data, the participant appears to have average to elevated levels of stress as indicated by the PSS domains. Given the available insights we will proceed with the analysis.

Firstly the participant's psychological traits and behaviors indicate to average to relatively elevated perceived stress levels as evidenced by correlations to stress (e.g., negative coping strategies as indicated by high ranking of stress-elevated cognitive and behavioral responses in the datasets). A consideration must to take into account the participant's Z-Scores relative to population averages to guide the final overall assessments regarding the stress assessment. In consideration to elevated PSS the analysis indicates potential redflags on stress levels regarding behaviors sleep disturbances experienced at relatively low sleep duration levels as indicated by high sleep variability and actigraph scores.

Sleep data suggests the participant has average duration sleep levels across a reltively elevated spectrum for sleep well duration start and end times, reflects possible disturbed circadian rhythms. However sleep duration metrics like sleep start times do not vary greatly. Also given, physiological and behavioral data, it can be inferred that cardiovascular and behavioral activities are associated with elevated perceived stress levels, they may vary the levels and physiological activity indicated heart rate data correlation exists, reflects stress levels.

Analyzing behavioral data from Fitbit wearable indicates sleep and activity times generally correlate - or correlate. The sleep start time metrics suggent metric reflects typical sleep quality as assessed through wearable-derived and self-reported sleep metrics, correlations were indicated between the PSS scores and metrics as the sleep-wearables sync at around 44 hour cycles.

Furthermore correlations to stress levels and behavioral or physiological patterns are indicated through negative or positive slope. This approach does reflect an overall strategy focused to support interpreting the patterns of daily stress within the scope of the stress results on psychological well-being questions partly relevant to these kinds.

Additionally, the analysis indicates that cardiovascular activity levels vary significantly across the day, indicating stress levels from normal wake to elevated stress-pyssey states and how the daily routines are impacted, together with stress levels to indicate higher perceived stress levels probably and likelihoods higher and increased correlation of behaviors, a sleep. Combining both the subjective self-reported sleep metrics with the wearable data indicates sleep quality and disturbance as sleep as the device-derived sleep metrics also reflect the participant's sleep debt that stress levels associate with stress response and with the sleep duration and sleep disturbances.

Additionally, the participant’s sleep duration and start times, it can be inferred that suggest a sleep- debt around and an irregular sleep-wake cycle which can indicate  what stress state are reflected and stress leve as measured by PSS. The value of the sleep could provide vary with highest stress level sleeper support invalid indication sleep behavior. The values of the MESOR, the parametric and the acrophase indicate a less-than-optimal circadian rhythm, the less-stress to optimal stress response on the stress-related lifestyle.

Overall, the evidence suggests the participant likely to experience relatively low or median stress levels. The analysis results suggest an overall stress classification as follows:

This pattern has significant implications for understanding and daily behaviors of participant.

The rest of the analysis shows usage of wearable activity trackers and show a more specific type of regular behavioral habits. Hourly Heart Rate Data indicates typical daily and physiological activity, generally participant shows irregular heart rate patterns. These physiological activity variations have been correlated to measure correlations with the actual stress of PSS (Perceived Stress more then stress indicative but self reporting score correlates).

The participant's self-reported sleep statistics and wearable-derived behavioral metrics indicate a pattern of low-stress, reflected by mesor and activity in multiple areas.

The self-report survey data suggest that the participant exhibits higher levels of perceived stress and anxiety, with indicators of poor sleep quality and sleep disorders. The participant's self-reported sleep metrics indicate stress-related sleep disturbances and a subjective experience of the sleep-related issues. The wearable-derived data shows, a relatively normal heart rate with variation, and the daily variation in heart rate shows a pattern of relatively high physiological arousal and daily variation. The participant's circadian rhythm metrics indicate a relatively normal heart rate and a relatively low-stress sleep-wake-patten-k.partial-.sleep statistics shows the highest correlation with the stress and the perceived stress.

The participant's data reflect a correlation between perceived stress (PSS) and the STAI scores show medium high anxiety and stress with significant indicators of normal variation of the stress in psychological evaluation, the cardiac-arterial index does not show abnormal heart rate. But, wearables' data is indicative of a relatively normal pattern of daily stress and can be associate with daily-moderate-stress with the study- related population-low-stress-.The presence of perceived low or average stress can reflect a populatuion of study with student, and normally, an association with a relatively large- University- canvas- separation can be maked.

The analysis of the evidence from all metrics and surveys, and behavioral data and psycholochol shows the holistic analysis provides evidence for low PSS scores (bottom 50th percentile) of the distribution. In this case, the conclusion of the evidence indicates that the participant likely has a low or median PSS score.

The participant's data indicates a medium stress level, and the participant is likely to be in the bottom 50% of the distribution.

In this case, the available evidence suggests a low or median PSS score. Available evidence shows that the participant's sleep statistics and sleep patterns, as well as their sleep metrics and subjective experience of sleep. The evidence suggests that the participant is likely to have a low or median PSS score.

The analysis concludes with one of the two following classifications:

The self-reported surveys indicate a relatively high level of depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale, with a low or median PSS score, though relative to the population. The participant's score on this scale is 22.5, and 1.43 z-score of -1.25, which might indicate the part where the population is distributed and 24.5  the median. The participant’s z-score is 28.51).

These individual’s sleep duration were mostly the aggregated values of total sleep statistics show the 50th percentile sleep phase being between 7.48 on Z-score relative to the population,24 hours a day and sleep schedule deviation of the sleep recorded at the 0.75 hour sleep phase. 

The aggregaed hourly heart rate deviations may provide insight into physiological arousal levels and cardiovascular stress, which are inferred to be relatively high given the correlations with the 0.54, which is a high correlation with the PSS domains of the population. Inferred from this 0.79  a z-score of -0.68 for the night, which indicates that this individual tends to sleep a relatively low amount of time, with 85 sleep duration, but sleeping over 60% and rest at a Z-Score value of the Z-score of -0.52 

Given the participant’s sleep data, it is inferred that this individual tends to sleep less than their peers, with an average sleep duration of the night of 7.7h. This can be further confirmed by the sleep duration and the sleep phase timing which shows a relatively low sleep duration as measured from  fitbit data and as measured from the perspective of the participants sleep.

Regarding sleep quality and start time, which can be inferred to be impacted by the 50th percentile of  low sleep quality. Sleep metrics derived from the wearable and self-reported data suggest a relatively low standard deviation of the mean heart rate from the mesor. We obserere a pattern indicating 58.22 of sleep disturbance or sleep disturbances -the participant usually wakes up during night).

The participant’s sedentary lifestyle and self-reported habits also indicate a low Z-Score value (-2.12) for self-reported sleep metrics. This suggests a relatively low sleep quality and a subjective experience of disturbed or poor sleep quality. The participant tends to have a different perspective of their sleep, as self-reported sleep metrics are included in the surveys section to accompany these Fitbit recorded metrics to indicate the subjective experience of the participant and include information not measurable via wearables.

A low or median PSS score would place the participant in the bottom half of the study population distribution.

Based on the data, the participant’s PSS is likely to be on the bottom half of the distribution.

In conclusion, the participant likely has a PSS score in the {""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""}.

The participant's responses on the perceived stress scale suggest that the individual's perceived stress is notable, and given the individual’s relatively higher values on anxiety-related subscale scores (e.g., STAI–Trait) and emotional well-being and other (related anxiety) symptoms . Furthermore, given the sleep statistics, it seems reasonable to conclude the existence of sleep disorders or disturbances and correlational trends that suggest sleep problems, and daily frustrations  correlated with stress, and this individuals PSS domains seems to be belonging at the higher range of the study population’s distribution.


Overall, it seems that this individual's PSS score would be ranking at the bottom 50th percentile of the distribution, and is therefore likely at the lower range of the distribution and likely belongs at the bottom half of the study population distribution. Given the evidence, it seems plausible that the participant likely has a low or median perceived stress level. The participant's behavioral habits and physiological metrics suggest that this individual is experiencing average levels of stress as measured by the perceived stress scale (PSS) and other behavioral and behavioral metrics.


The analysis of behavioral and physiological metrics also supports this classification.

70492,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"The participant's psychological state is characterized by the results of several self-report surveys, behavioral habits and wearable derived behavioral and physiological metrics. In analyzing these data, certain trends emerge that can indicate the level of perceived stress.

The data indicates the participant's score on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is at a level that can be considered as ""low"" or ""average"" since the correlation of multiple wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics such as sleep duration, is close to zero.

The sleep statistics show that the participant sleeps for a duration that can be considered ""normal"" though the sleep start time is relatively consistent throughout the recording period.

Daily habits of excercise and hour-by-hour heart rate data are important. As they tend toward being a  nexus to indicate low cardiovascular exertion  identifiable heart rate patterns are provided in the hourly heart rate data. We can use this data to indicate whether the participant tends to have a high or low-stress PSS domain domains (PSS). The current dataset is arranged by the Z-scored sleep-derived metrics to also examine associations of the sleeping patterns and behavioral tendencies.

Given the Correlations of multiple metrics from self-reported survey data and wearable derived data we have - a link of Z-Scored PSS correlations across all metrics and guiding interpretation and PSS domains we can conclude this participant likely has a low stress level (bottom 50). 

The daily heart rate patterns indicate less deviation of the mean heart rate from the mesor, where the resting heart rate of 53 beats per minute is  and the participant’s heart rate in the resting hours are near their calculated hourly values of other participants. The correlations and hour-by-hour heart rate data are meant to provide a correlation with the Z-score of the PSS. 

It would be overly speculative, yet given the sleep-related data, behavioral and physiological data, one pattern emerges, a relatively regular sleep-wake cycle and relatively low Z-Score(-0.61) of sleep indicates the relationship to PSS scores, standard deviation Z-scores and sleep patterns and it can be argued for the participant’s PSS in the bottom 50 percentile.

The data also suggests the participant’s social media and social media usage data which may be correlated. The daily routines show little to no excercise or physical demands placed upon the individual. Given the evidence provided the correlation coefficient are roughly small to confirm an overall PSS score.

Given no indication of unusual patterns and values for the circadian rhythm metrics were detected and the standard Z-Score of those is low (with no circadian-rhythm-related issues detectable), and given the low overall stress and the absence of stress-related behaviors in this population’s does not exhibit unusual or stress-provoking behaviors. Thus this suggests that the participant is likely to have relatively stress-less behaviors and relatively low physiological reactions to stress.

Performing a holistic analysis of the evidence, if any is available, for a low or median PSS score (representing relatively low or average perceived stress). Given the correlations between the values and the PSS score are also provided. This analysis can indicate whether this participant’s overall perceived stress level (as measured by the PSS domains) would place them at the top or bottom half of the study population distribution. The top or bottom half classification is finally concluded as follows:

The combined PSS and lifestyle survey data indicates low levels of anxiety, and depressive symptoms, with no notable correlations between PSS scores and Z-scores for the Combined Input data. The circadian data analyzed indicates relatively low regularity in daily heart rate patterns, and significant inter-daily variability in heart rate-based circadian rhythm during recording period. Interdaily stability is (somewhat) compromised during the semester.

An examination of the combined data indicates regular excercise habits (reporting about 3 times a week for the average recorded values) - These values of  exersise data reflect relatively low heart rate deviation (from resting) and regularity in sleep start times - indicating a participant with a moderate-to-high-stress profile - inactive during the semester. This is supported by the devitation of other measures not included in the analysis of.

Daily aggregated data from Fitbit indicate a relatively constant pattern of heart rate. There is very low devitation of the mean resting heart rate from participant’s data (Z-score  -1.08), suggesting lower than normal stress.

According to data some traits that are not corelated with stress (e.g., relationships) are also important to perceived stress levels.

Further examination of the wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics indicates that the sleep patterns, as evidenced by the Fitbit data reveal a, net result of relatively lower sleep quality and quality of sleep and daytime heart rate variability. These metrics have been aggregated to derive meaningful insights that suggest the participant has elevated stress levels as a result of relatively higher sleep fragmentation and fragmentation across daytime and nighttime hours.

The analysis of the combined data suggests the presence of relatively elevated heart rate levels and a higher sleep fragmentation. The participant sleeps a normal sleep duration and has an irregular sleep schedule. The participant’s resting heart rate and sleep and sleep start times are also indicative of an overall sleep pattern, as are the sleep duration and sleep quality and sleep start time and sleep start times.

The participant's self-reported sleep statistics are confirmed through their wearables, indicating poor subjective experience of their sleep and sleep patterns.

The participant's physiological data from the wearable, show sleep patterns consistent with those experiencing average stress levels. For the most part, the participant’s wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics indicate a person experiencing stress to some extent. One metric, in particular, show correlations to a moderate degree with stress. Wearable Fitbit recorded sleep duration, reveal that the participant’s average sleep duration is lower, a finding also supported through their self-reported survey. More specifically, wearable device recorded the total sleep time, revealing average sleep time of 7 hours and 39 minutes, this is lower compared to the population’s mean sleep time of 7.5 hours, in this context the lowest recorded sleep duration, and  also the latest sleep start time.  Sleep statistics of this kind show, deviations from population norms,  but interestingly these show circadian stability of  realtive sleep patterns.

The wearable-derived data show sleep stability, with the participant’s mean resting heart rate lower compared to population norm, and with standard deviation showing stability in their sleep pattern. Data extracted through cosinor analysis, patterns that are cyclical in nature, showing regular sleep patterns with periods of high heart rates during late morning and early evening hours. These data reveal a regular sleep-wake-up-wake-wake patern revealing patterns, more directly after midnight.

Wearable Fitbit data discloses relevant patterns in the participant’s lifestyle.

The participant’s stress levels are indicated by a combination of the behavioral and physiological metrics, some of which are correlated with stress levels. More specifically, it appears that stress is an indicator of overall wellness of a person rather than the traditional view of stress as just being something that happens to a person due to internal or external circumstances and and rather stress being a product of internal and external factors, the participant’s physiological metrics show sleep stability and their sleep patterns are relatively stable and the correlation between the PSS score and behavioral metrics show a positive correlation.

The combination of self-reported survey scores, with provided correlations to other metrics suggest a correlated tension between self-perceived stress and lifestyle factors (e.g., low exercise and poor sleep) along with relations with mental health symptoms. For instance, the data may indicate the individual’s psychological tension related with their engagement in activities, potentially indicating stress impacts through correlations between Z-scored stress metrics.

The wearble-derived behavioral and physiological metric seem to have some degree of correlation with daily sleep patterns. Intraday variability is relatively low. This suggests the participant sleeps with a relative low frequency of sleep disorders, due to the the wearable, enables the tracking of circadian rhythm features. On the basis of this data, the participant has a relatively low heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics with regards regular sleep duration.

Also parametic and non-parametric measures derived from the heart rate data indicate interdaily instability and high intraday variability of the circadian rhythm metrics, suggesting again a low-stress participant.

From a holistic perspective, the participant’s self-report survey and wearable data indicate relatively low stress, overall sleep statistics, suggest the participant sleeps an average number of hours per day. According to the Fitbit data, this is also supported by the participant's relatively low sleep statistic and resting heart rate and interdaily stability data derived from the circadian metrics indicate regular sleep patterns. A high self-reported sleep quality is also suggested by the participant's reported sleep metrics. The deviations of the mean heart rate for each hour of the day, suggest daily variation of physiological and physiological arousal.

The participant’s overall perceived stress can be inferred through a combination of the self-reported and wearable-derived metrics. The relationship between the heart rate and PSS is -0.07. The correlation with the sleep duration is .033. The participant is likely to have a low stress level because their sleep is consistently 8 hours and 50 minutes. The participant’s sleep pattern is indicative of relatively low stress because sleep is 8 hours and 50 minutes which is average. The participant’s average sleep duration is -0.38 relative to the study population and is 8.17 hours of sleep which is slightly more than average sleep which is relatively low because average sleep is -0.39.The heart rate data indicates a relatively normal sleep pattern because the average duration of sleep is -0.38 compared to the population which makes the Z-score of -0.37 less concerning stress.

It appears the participant engages in behaviors which may indicate low stress because the Z-score of the heart rate data is -0.85 and relatively low, the mean Z-score of -0.58 relative to the study population. In this participant, the average hourly heart rate shows a peak of around 2pm and relatively low at  night, around 12 am and relatively low stress. When considering sleep data sleep duration of 8 hours and sleep timing always around same time each day. When considering daily routine data the participant wake up early at around 7:30 am or a low of  around 9:00 pm makes evidence that daily stress low indicated is relatively low because participant always wake-up at the same time each day.


Overall the combined data indicates the participant has relatively low perceived stress, and behaviors. The participant has a sleep of relatively good quality and sleep regularity of sleep. The participant has relatively low stress as indicated by the low score and overall behavioral and physiological metrics data. Specifically the PSS correlation and the sleep duration combined is with the value of 0.58 suggesting relatively low or average stress, comprising sleep and stress is relatively low.

The self-reported survey scores and wearable metrics both offer a detailed view of the participant’s behaviors and physiological state. 

One of the most relevant psychological metrics is the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) that scores range from 0-30. The participant’s PSS score is not explicitly provided in the dataset but falls within the lower to average range of the study population. The subjective experience of stress for the participant, as indicated by their self-reported PSS scores and the combined wearable activity metrics and physiological metrics show a complex inter-relationship between their behaviors and stress indicators. 

Their sleep duration and start times also show a non-stressful sleep pattern with a median sleep duration of 8 hours and 49 minutes indicated. Their wearable-derived activity and behavior metrics also align with non-significant correlations to their self-reported stress levels as measured with lower-stressed-out participants and physiologic correlations of wearable derived heart rates from both metrics showing a stressful signal of this relation.

Given that, behaviors like exercise, sedentary activity is also provided with a ranked signals from lower-stressed participants indicating a lower-stressed participant. Their lifestyle also appears to maintain relatively average PSS levels through survey questions and overall perceived stress of the participant as measured by the PSS appears within the average range but overall places the participant within the lower half of the population.

Overall Ranking of PSS Score 
Analyzing the combined data from self-reported surveys and wearable-derived behavioral metrics, and physiologic correlations show a relatively consistent participant but their stress levels as indicated by the PSS score might place the participant at the bottom 50% of the distribution of the study population of the PSS distribution.

The participant’s self-reported stress is reflected in the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and can be associated with the rest of the wearable-derived metrics and behavioral habits.

The participant’s sleep patterns indicate a median sleep duration of 6 hours and 15 minutes, with a median of 6 hours and 45 minutes of which 6 hours and 15 minutes of sleep are spent after midnight. This sleep duration and start time are somewhat lower compared to the rest of the population, and indicate poor sleep quality. The participant’s subjective sleep experience is further associated with self-reported sleep metrics and may include self-reported sleep disturbances.

The PSS correlations with the values are crucial in understanding the participant’s perceived stress. For the rest of the multimodal analysis we will assume the following. 

The participant’s overall perceived stress as indicated by the PSS is likely to be categorized either at the higher end of the population distribution or at the lower end. 

The analysis has “top_50” or “bottom_50” and that will be decided based on the following analysis.

Given the participant’s relatively low or average level of perceived stress as indicated by low or median PSS score, and low resting heart rate below which typically is associated to stress-free life or highly correlated behaviors with low stress life. The participant’s PSS score could indicate relatively low or average perceived stress. 

Based on the participant’s self-report survey data and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics, the participant’s data suggests an overall ranking of PSS of either higher end or lower end of distribution. 
The participant’s self-reported sleep duration was 7 hours and 33 minutes, which is very close to the average. The participant reported a sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality with a low sleep quality and poor sleep quality which are associated to perceived stress. The participant’s resting heart rate was relatively stable and fell in the lower range of normal compared to other population. The participant’s sleep was consistently  when it began and also the duration of sleep. 

The combined data from wearable Fitbit metrics shows the the participant’s heart rate and activity was not normally distributed but exhibited certain rhythmic and stress-related correlations. Considering the stress correlations of the circadian rhthym  the amplitude of the the participant’s heart rate correlated highly with the PSS. The participant’s sleep quality can be further analyzed to understand how sleep and sleep patterns are related to perceived stress. 

Given the analysis of the sleep, we cannot conclude that the participant is in the top or bottom half of the study population distribution for the perceived stress. 
However the overall distribution of the data suggests more evidence is needed to fully determine whether the participant has a PSS score in the top or bottom 50%."

The participant's perceived stress level, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), can be inferred from the interplay of the PSS domains and the accompanying statistical metrics.

The participant's overall PSS score, and ranking in the distribution can be inferred from the correlation of the PSS domains and the accompanying statistical metrics, as well as the participant’s sleep duration, daily variation, heart rate patterns, and circadian rhythm metrics. The wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics, such as sleep duration and heart rate variability, are correlated with the PSS, as well as the participant’s self-reported sleep quality and subjective experience.

The wearable-derived data, such as sleep duration and heart rate, provide a unique view of the participant’s circadian rhythm and perceived stress levels. The participant’s psychological state, as inferred from the correlations between the wearable metrics and the PSS, as well as the participant’s sleep duration, daily activities, and resting heart rate patterns, such as heart rate variability provide an overall picture of the participant’s perceived stress levels and physiological state.

The participant's self-reported sleep metrics are accompanied by the wearable-derived sleep statistics, such as the median sleep duration and the sleep start time, which is correlated with the PSS score, as measured by the PSS. The correlation of 0.17 suggests that the participant's sleep duration is relatively stable in the bottom 50% of the distribution. Given the Z-score of the sleep duration relative to the participant’s population is  1.5, the sleep duration and quality of 8 hours and 53 minutes can be inferred to place the participant in a stress state.

The heart rate and circadian rhythm metrics, including the mesor, the parametric and non-parametric measures such as amplitude, acrophase, and inter-daily stability, suggest patterns of physiological stress and physiological states. These metrics, along with the daily sleep patterns, do suggest a physiological and behavioral pattern for the participant.

The data obtained, as well as the subjective experience of the participant, suggest patterns of behaviors and behaviors across multiple contexts, physiological and behavioral, a low or median PSS score or the bottom 50%. With a Z-Score of -0.31 for resting and mean hourly heart rate deviations across all recorded days, along with circadian rhythm metrics from the wearable device, suggest that physiological stress levels, are not unusually elevated and correlate to a relatively stable PSS score.

The mean sleep duration and the sleep start time can be inferred to evaluate patterns of stress-related behaviors and behaviors, and circadian metrics do confirm a diurnal pattern for the participant. The correlations between the values, and the PSS domains, suggesting relatively low perceived stress.

Considering the comprehensive data, the participant’s sleep patterns and heart rate variability patterns, suggest that the participant is experiencing a relatively low level of perceived stress.

Their sleep statistics are relatively stable compared to the rest of the study population with median sleep duration at  around 6 hours but relatively low sleep duration is at  the 25th percentile of the population distribution. This indicates the participant has a relatively normal sleep duration compared to the population, but lower sleep quality compared to others. The participant's wearable metrics indicate a generally normal sleep-wake and sleep quality metrics, which are within 1 standard deviation of the population mean. This is a relatively low level of reported stress considering their PSS domains, and correlations between these metrics and PSS indicate relatively low stress compared to others in the study population.

The participant’s combined data, especially physiological metrics such as heart rate variability (intradaily and interdially stability metrics) suggests the following patterns: the participant experiences stress during peak hours 20:00 - 21:00 - 14:00 PM) with higher than average (Z-score = .32) heart rate deviations, especially during late night and early morning (12:00 AM - 7:00 AM) with relatively higher stress levels. This pattern of stress across the 21-hour day was found, suggests likely elevated during academic periods (2:00 AM - 5:00 PM), higher during periods of the day (8:00 AM - 2:00 PM) with significant stress deviation from the participant’s resting heart rate. 

Based on the self-reported and wearable device metrics combination, there were found sleep statistic correlation of a low Z-score. It is interesting that there were found more time stamped data from the participant’s wearable devices and with their stress correlation (PSS). For most of the sleep statistics, the participant showed average to above average sleep (6:30 AM - 7:30 AM) heart rate levels and time-stamped stress. This suggests relatively high stress levels. 

When analyzing the participant’s wearable data and heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics - parametric (MESOR), Cosinor analysis indicated relatively high levels of physiological (PSS) arousal and sleep (e.g., interdaily stability, the intraday and interdaily stability) are indicative of stress.

For task 2: Ranking of PSS, the overall perceived stress as indicated by the participant’s PSS metrics would be ranked in relation with the distribution. By integrating all of the analyzed data and correlations between the participant’s PSS score with the top and bottom population’s PSS distribution (top 50% vs bottom 50%) shows the holistic data from both self-report and wearable device metrics. Given that the data shows the following: 

- If the participant is experiencing low stress levels (bottom 50%) 
- If the participant has a low PSS score the Z-score of the PSS and other metrics will likely be negatively correlated -  show a higher (positive) value from the rest (higher) and relatively low Z-score value relative to their population norms.

Given the available evidence and data analyzed the participant’s overall stress as PSS and rank the participant’s in relation to the general population and perceived ranking according to their own distribution as either top 50 or bottom 50. The goals is to decide between the two options, being either in top or bottom of the distribution - (PSS).

With the data in mind the best decision would be: 

{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""} OR {""pss_group"": ""top_50""} OR 
{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""} 
is 
{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""} 
The analysis will conclude with one of the two classifications in the following format: 
{""pss_group"": ""top_50""} OR {""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""}. 
The evidence of stress will indicate that the participants stress is relatively average or low. 
In accordance with the data analyzed the conclusion will be: 

{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""} 
given a Z-score of -0.74 for sleep self-reported and resting rates of a participant to indicate relatively high sleep statistic, correlation found and medium sleep statistic correlation of stress-level affecting variables and lower medium sleep stats and the subjective experience, this is the participant’s - of evidence that the participant has an average stress or PSS distribution which relatively can have a low to average, holistic view of the ranking - given the available evidence. 

The participant’s data shows relatively low Z-scores (given the negative deviation from the mean and relatively low Z-scores of sleep), and relatively stable and positive behavioral and psychological metrics. The Z-score (-2.42) of -0.78 for the PSS correlation suggests the medium level of stress reported by a relatively stable participant. A negative Z-score (-0.56) for perceived stress, along with relatively stable physiological and behavioral metrics suggests lower than average sleep duration and sleep statistics and a lower number of sleep issues and stress-related problems. These values indicate that the participant experiences relatively low or average stress. A PSS score of -0.32 would place the participant at the bottom half (bottom 50%) of the distribution.

The relationship between the Perceived Stress Scale and other factors of the psychological and behavioral space is crucial in understanding stress levels. The participant's overall perceived stress level on the Perceived Stress Scale can be inferred from analysis of the data.

Self-reported surveys are one source of data that illuminates the psychological space. Scores and statistical measures indicate good or average stress levels. Sleep metrics provide more depth and some insights into circadian rhythms. Wearable metrics on Fitbit, provide hourly values of mean heart rate and hourly deviation to mesor. Parametric measures of circadian rhythms indicate a regular pattern. Non-parametric measures of interdaily stability show high variability. Daily variability and sleep metrics also indicate poor sleep quality and a high level of stress.

The data suggests the sleep-wake and duration lasts between 6:45 and 7:45 AM/PM. The data also indicates poor sleep quality and sleep patterns. Higher values of the sleep quality, interdaily stability of the rhythm indicate good regularity but intraday variability measures showed more sleep disturbed periods and the phase shifted later to 7:15 AM.

Interpreting self-reporting behavioral data also indicates a slightly above average happiness with minimal to average heart rates (mesor) sleep regularity. Circadian rhthm metrics yield typical heart rate variability during the day with generally good daily sleep and some sleep patterns suggest a minimal elevated physiological response to stress possibly indicating an above average physiological and behavioral reaction to stress and that the participant, in contrast to the cohort, possibly due to a more relaxed or balanced lifestyle. Sleep metrics also indicate good sleep patterns and heart rate variability. Although correlation to the PSS score is indicative of relatively low stress. 

Given that sleep data also correlate to an adequate sleep and the participant reporting sleep disturbances,- the does not sleep- it implies that sleep is good, possibly and reliably normal variability- given evidence of low stress. Also, the hour-by-hourly heart rate deviations of the participant show typical daily cardiovascular fluctuations, which implies are likely to be of relatively low stress with good evidence of physiological and behavioral state regularity. 

Looking at circadian rhthm metrics, including parametric measures (e.g., MESOR, ampltude) from cosinor analysis and Non-parametric measures (e.g., interdaily stability) from heart rate data derived features provide even more details about regular patterns of the heart rate of the participant during the recorded period.

This conclusion that draws on multiple sources of information in regards to psychology state,s perceived stress, and behavior. Data was analyzed from a multifaceted perspective  including self-reported surveys and wearable-derived metrics from wearables and physiological metrics. The goal was to draw conclusions on perceived stress level (as measured by the PSS domains) and identify whether the participants's perceived stress level would be at the top or bottom of the distribution. 


The data presented a myriad of information that gave insights into the participants habits, behaviors and physiological statistics and correlations with the PSS score. This led the analysis into sections of physiological and behavioral and behavioral metrics. These include Cor scale survery score for total sleep durations, qui less common self-reported sleep metrics like perceived sleep experiences not measurable through wearables ( not limited to sleep patterns recorded and variability of activity patterns), sleep metrics derived from surveys not from wearable activity trackers recorded. Heart rate variability data included in the hourly aggragate median heart rate deviation realtively from aggregated across all recorded days provided hourly insights into the participant's physiological arousal. These metrics were analyzed along side the survey scores that measured subjective experiences.


From the combined input,s a general overview of physiological and behavioral metrics can be drawn that paint a picture of a stressed individual who experiences stress both psychologically and physiologically. This provides evidence for both the subjective interpretation of stress through self-reported surveys and behavioral patterns exhibited through activity tracking.

A holistic examination of the data provided shows that the participant's overall perceived stress level, measured by the PSS domains,can be classified into two parts, the top 50% vs the bottom 50%. In terms of our analysis we have compared this participant's values of multiple metrics (some scores reported below).

The PSS correlations table also indicates positive and negative correlations with an accompanying note that we should consider cautiously.

In conclusion, based on evidence gathered from the CombinedInput, this participant’s data indicates a higher propensity towards experiencing stress related issues which suggest based on the more salient features.

Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the participant has a PSS score that would classify them in the lower half (bottom 50%) of the study population. The amount of stress and stress are in the mediocre or lower middle part of the stress range - probably around the median.

79167,10.0,0.010362694300518135,"The participant's data reveals a complex interplay between psychological traits, physiological and behavioral metrics. The participant's self-reported sleep metrics and wearable-derived sleep metrics both indicate regular sleep habits. The participant's sleep start time is around 23:30 and the sleep duration is around 8 hours and 50 minutes, sleep quality is rated at  with a low standard deviation. The data shows that the participant has a relatively low sleep disorder with a relatively low standard deviation from the mean sleep duration compared to the population, with a median Z-Score value of -1.25 for sleep duration indicating lower sleep quality from the mean.

The participant’s self-reported sleep metrics report similar sleep habits to the wearable-derived metrics, with the self-reported mean sleep duration being in the 50th percentile rank compared to the population distribution, with a z-score rank around the mean. The participant’s subjective experience of sleep indicates regular sleep quality and a relatively normal sleep experience.

.

The participant’s sleep statistics indicate regular sleep patterns with minimal night-to-night variability, indicating good sleep quality and regular sleep schedules.

The participant's sleep patterns are characterized as average with no indication of sleep deprivation, sleep apnea or somnambul utilization disorders.

The wearable-derived heart rate metrics demonstrate variability in daily heart rate and deviation from the mean heart rate, behavioral and physiological arousal levels. The data shows relatively normal heart rate variability and sleep quality. The participant’s resting heart rate is relatively normal and compares to the population with z-score of -0.13 for the purposes of evaluating the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). 

Interpretation of  Heart rates vs Daily heart rate variability is as follows: 
Participant’s hourly deviation of mean heart rate for every hour compared to their mesor or overall activity levels relatively indicates typical cardiovascular activity patterns and are represented by Z-scored relative values to compare the participant’s daily heart rate activity and variability across the population to understand stress influence.

The heart rate-derived circadian rhythm metrics and sleep duration indicate a relatively regular sleep-wakey-wake-up and wake-up behavior.

.

Overall, the participant’s physiological and behavioral metrics do not provide conclusive evidence of perceived stress, but point towards a relatively low perceived stress level as indicated through a combination of low-to-average sleep quality, nocturnal sleep-wake-up behaviors, average heart rate, lower resting heart rate and Z-score of -0.13 from the study population, relatively.

Based on evidence, like this, we can interpret that a participant with this relatively healthier profile has relatively low heart rate-based daily activity levels, relatively low self-reported sleep disturbance, if most sleep, behavioral quality would indicate lower stress and anxiety, behavior., e.g., relatively small (PSS score of 25) would place this participant in the bottom 50% of the study population distribution, with regards to their PSS score.

The final analysis of the data indicates that the participant likely has a: 
{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""}

The data indicates typical sleep patterns, we can consider a distribution within wake-up and sleep start times and regular patterns associated with emotional regulation and management using stress-related emotional regulation. 

The hourly heart rate data and sleep metrics indicate different patterns and levels of physiological arousal and sleep and rest can impact overall stress to perceived by self-report survey.

The wearable-derived data suggests a typical pattern, the participant's reported sleep is slightly below average, most days but within a  healthy range,The sleep quality metrics and heart rate variability data reveal patterns of stress levels being higher than reported in self-assessays despite reporting average levels of stress self reported in self-assays.

Upon examining the participant’s self-reported sleep metrics, we observe that their reported sleep quality and rest reported are within average or expected levels. The PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) indicates an above-average stress level which is a disturbing finding in the self-assessments and indicates the participant has high stress in this index. The participant’s overall stress levels as measured by PSS seems to be relatively average, some metrics indicating sleep disturbances that are not within pathological levels in their reports.


The aggregated hourly heart rate data shows deviations from the participant’s resting heart rate, the values indicating relatively expected stress levels at various times of the day. Patterns of daily stress, which the deviations illustrate physiological stress that can be interpreted relative to the participant’s resting heart rate.


Interpretations of Correlalatted Values
These correlate with various degrees of the PSS score.
We proceed with holistic interpretation.
The evidence for a high PSS score is that the participant has an average stress level. The data available suggests the participant likely has an average stress level.

36117,21.0,0.46113989637305697,"The participant's data suggests a complex interplay of psychological, physiological, and behavioral metrics. The participant's self-reported trait measures indicate a range of psychological metrics. The participant's scores on psychological metrics indicate a level of psychological metrics including stress and anxiety. The participant's perceived stress score is an important indicator of psychological stress. The participant's PSS score is an important metric to evaluate. The participant's overall perceived stress level is indicated by the PSS domains which are measured and related scores correlations to help guide interpretation. 

Analyzing the participant’s behavioral and wearable data metrics, we observe a number of trends. 
The wearable Fitbit data indicates the participant engages in regular sleep patterns with an average sleep duration of 7-8 hours and sleep start times of around 10:30 PM. 
The combined data indicates relatively regular sleep schedules. The sleep metrics suggest a high consistency in the sleep and irregular sleep times which usually vary. 
The average sleep duration usually is around 7-10 hours but varies between 6-12 hours. The sleep duration varies among participants but generally stays within the range of 6-10 hours sleep which are associated with a number of Z-scores. The sleep metrics are within one standard deviation and are within the normal range for the sleep duration and and sleep start times. These times have small variations and are associated with high self-reported stress and anxiety scores and small deviations. 
The participant’s scores on sleep quality is relatively low, with an average sleep quality score of 6 and a standard deviation of 93 minutes. The sleep data suggests the participant has satisfactory rest and sleep and stress management. 
The dataset shows the participant has relatively better or average than usual physical or stress reactions to daily stress and as indicated relative stress levels. This may indicate stress or be a stress indicator in some form.

Also, evaluating daily activities and wearable data, the participant’s heart rate and activity levels indicate an overall stress level, given PSS is an indicator for the psychological evaluation of stress. Physiological metrics suggest an elevated stress level or low-medium stress indicators from metrics given the combination of behavioral metrics. The daily activity levels measured from wearable metrics suggest the participant is less active during the day and more active at night. The low activity levels may indicate a rest and stress-recovery activity level or a low stress level.

The combined data suggests the participant is likely to have a relatively low stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale. Lower stress scores are more often associated with healthy behaviors such as regular circadian rhythms, a stable schedule, and daytime activity levels indicate a balance between stress and rest and a regular stress-free lifestyle.

 
Analyzed evidence from available metrics indicates the participant’s overall perceived stress level is more likely to be at the bottom 50 percentile of the distribution.

The participant's sleep statistics, revealed a median sleep duration of 6 hours and a sleep start time of 1:14 AM, which indicates a relatively consistent sleep schedule. However, this needs to be considered alongside the participant’s subjective experience of sleep metrics revealed in the surveys. The participant’s reported sleep quality metrics reveal a sleep duration of around 7 hours and  this metric’s Z-score is 1.96 which indicates the participant sleep patterns in relation to population norms. This implies the participant sleeps around 7.20 hours in total. Further data related to participant’s sleep behaviors should also be analyzed relative to population norms and norms. 

The participant's sleep statistics revealed a sleep duration of around 6 hours and 25 minutes. The participant’s subjective report of the sleep revealed a mean sleep quality of 1:35 hour which Z-score is -2.24, this imply participant tends to oversleep.

Given the sleep statistics data, the participant is at a 50 percentile of the population. Sleep durations and sleep patterns may indicate either a sleep disorder or very flexible sleep patterns.

It appears the daily routine has some implications to the perceived stress levels and behaviors. The daily pattern of  the participant shows that the sleep pattern and sleep duration is relatively consistent, this suggests relatively lower perceived stress levels.

Given the cardiovascular metrics data, the participant's resting heart rate is 61 beats per minute. This needs to be considered in relation to the hourly heart rate deviations, as it relates to stress.

The daily pattern of heart rate deviations as indicated by mean, standard heart deviations of 58.59 and this suggest relatively moderate stress levels, participant’s typical day shows relatively low-stress when heart rate deviation indicate the magnitude of heart rate increase.

Given data has found significant correlations with PSS score,  such that r = 0.19 and   = 0.14, these correlations should be analyzed considering the context to other behavioral and self-report data. Considering the z-score of the PSS, this data it should be analyzed considering magnitude and correlation coefficients.

In analyzing the combined dataset for the participant the survey scores show a significant Z-score which indicates a relatively higher stress levels are associated with PSS domains of stress and the value is 49.0 a high value in the given context which suggests elevated levels of perceived stress.

Further evidence indicates this pattern show self-reported data of anxiety levels relatively high  considering the subjective sleep metrics with a Z-score of -2.81 including the median, and happiness and self-reported score of  a low and median Z-score indicates the participant is relatively calm.

On hourly heart rate deviation relative to mesor (given the hourly aggregated values),  much of these values are close to the population norms, this suggests moderate arousal patterns across the day.

Analyzing the correlations to the values and their respective Z-score and considering the participant's stress metrics and behavioral patterns and stress, this suggests relatively high stress levels are indicated by correlations but daily behavioral metrics indicate a relatively calm participant.

In analyzing the combined data from different perspectives, the sleep and behavioral habits of this participant show an average of stress levels. Given these Z-scores are significant indicators of psychological states, and behavioral patterns, and moderate daily patterns of physiological stress. These metrics reflect a relatively moderate stress levels and stress.

However, these values need to be considered in the context to other behavioral and self-report data. Considering the participant's sleep behaviors and self-report survey metrics, Z-scores of sleep and the heart rate metrics, Z-scores relative to population norms and stress levels.

As these patterns, the data of self-reported metrics and wearable-derived metrics of stress and stress indicate the stress experienced by participant. With stress and anxiety, and stress patterns reveal a significance. 

Finally, analyzing the combined data from different metrics and modalities, the participant’s perceived stress level can be evaluated as the top  or bottom of the distribution.

Based on the analysis of combined behavioral and physiological metrics of the participant, the conclusion of the participant’s perceived stress levels should be placed in the bottom 50% considering relatively low of the population distribution or higher population with  within the bottom 50% percent distribution and top 50%, the conclusions from the evidence.

Given the significant indicators in the data set, the conclusion can be made based on the correlations and z-scores relative population distribution and measures reveal a participant is at the 2.3 of the population norms which implies and suggests relatively low stress behaviors and perceived psychological states. It indicates participant is at the bottom 50th percentile including the median, and low-stress population distributions.

Thus, the participant’s overall perceived stress level would place them at the bottom 50 percentiles of population distribution.

This pattern indicates overall low sleep quality with large intraday variability.

The sleep statistics and self-reported sleep metrics are complemented by wearable Fitbit recorded sleep data which shows that the total duration of sleep was about 7 hours and sleep onset varied. The subjective sleep experience suggests a positive correlation with total sleep durations of over 14 hours.

The participant’s sleep statistics, as derived from the wearable Fitbit, are indicated by the median sleep duration and the standard deviation of sleep patterns, such that the  “Nightly sleep statistics regarding total sleep durations“ and sleep start times and the median and deviation are provided. The sleep duration and the start of sleep time provided provide insight to the participant’s rest and recovery patterns and these can be aggregated with the self-reported survey and the subjective experience of sleep as recorded by the participant and can be seen as a combination of the participant’s physiological and behavioral patterns.

It appears that the participant’s sleep and rest patterns are indicated by the sleep statistics and the wearable data show correlations with stress and perceived stress as measured by the PSS. The participant’s sleep is characterized by the duration of sleep and sleep schedules and can further explore the correlations between the sleep statistics and stress as measured by the PSS. In particular, we can examine that sleeping patterns and correlations between the participant’s sleep statistics and correlations and the value of their stress levels.

The participant's wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics, indicate a relatively typical circadian rhythm with some evidence of stability in daily heart rate patterns and nocturnal sleep-wake cycle.

An in-depth examination of the wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics indicates that the participant exhibits a relatively normal and relatively stable circadian rhythm as evidenced by the parametric and non-parametric circadian rhythm metrics and the hourly heart rate data exhibits evidence of diurnal variation. Specifically, the mean heart rate of the participant is 55.45 beats per minute at rest and the deviation from the resting heart rate varies as indicated by a relatively low deviation of -4.2 beats per minute, funds that are indications of a relatively high stress period, throughout the recording period.

Given the dataset and performance metrics available in this specific, the analysis must provide a conclusion for whether the participant’s perceived stress (PSS) score would be at the top or bottom half of the distribution based on a low, a median or a low PSS score (bottom 50th percentile including the median of the distribution), or a high PSS score (top 50th percentile). High levels of stress are associated with poorer outcomes in more aggressive assessments to indicate overall low or average stress when the data indicates a top or bottom half distribution in rank, such as available PSS Domains through whole recording. If possible evidence of low stress could place this participant in the bottom 50% since relatively low self reported stress of PSS score domain value and less variability of the data, tends to indicate that that low or relatively low stress patterns tend to exhibit specific self-evaluated behaviors and self-efficacy of behavioral data along with  physiological wearables indicating regular patterns of daily living and sleep statistics.

Given that the participant’s data includes a diverse set of self-report survey questions and behavioral and physiological metrics derived from wearable devices and the dataset the particp’s PSS scores correlates with various wearable-derived behavioral and behavioral metrics along with perceived stress and behavioral patterns. 

The participant’s data in comparison to the study population mean is suggestive of a relatively low-stress individual, given that the perceived stress measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is consistent with behaviors and physiological metrics, their traits, and  self reported sleep and physiological data from wearables and that these metrics reflect an overall relatively normal of population - in terms their PSS scores. They seems more likely have a medium to have a high  but not extreme stress score. 
It is noteworthy that participant data contains a mix of self-reported behavioral and behavioral and physiological metrics and thus can help evaluate their perceived stress in multple facets. 

Analyzing the data provided, the participant’s data suggests a mix of salient features that are correlated with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score. The sleep statistics indicate the participant tends to have a relatively normal sleep duration and sleep start time but the sleep statistics also suggest a subjective sleep quality disturbance; The values suggest that their mesor is around 76.9 and the standard deviion of the values is not remarkably different from 0 and their values have no significant deviation from mesor but slightly above average at times but significantly lower at some other times of the day - tends to be relatively calm except for a couple of times in a day.

The participant's heart rate data shows a standard deviation of their resting heart rate. The participant's data shows a correlation of -0.15 with the PSS score. 

The circadian rhythm metrics show the participant has a relatively high regularity in sleep patterns and shows significant variability and irregular sleep patterns as indicated by the standard deviation of their sleep data and their self-reported sleep quality metrics. These metrics alongside the participant's wearable activity data suggests a strong physical and psychological component to the participant’s stress levels. They have relatively low sleep duration with a median of 6 hours and 14 minutes. 

Their self-reported survey data indicates relatively average or median stress and anxiety scores and these are negatively correlated to their self-esteem and trust scores and happiness scores. Their STAI score suggests an individual prone to anxiety. The participant engages in physical activity regularly and this is positively correlated with their stress levels. The overall picture suggests the participant has a moderate level of stress as their stress levels are likely exacerbated by sleep deprivation and anxiety. 

Therefore, the analysis of all metrics including self-reporting, their wearable device activity suggests that the participant likely falls within the bottom 50% of the distribution of stress scores.

The wearable-derived metrics such as sleep and heart rate data provide valuable insights into behavioral and physiological patterns. 

The participant's sleep duration data shows a correlation with their perceived stress levels, and heart rate variability with the sleep statistics. For sleep patterns a range of six to seven hours indicates normal to high levels of stress with a low to moderate correlation sleep duration and quality and can be inferred from heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics. Sleep disturbance and sleep metrics also correlate with the heart rate-based circadian rhythm metrics and sleep quality, and sleep duration to stress. 

From combined Fitbit and survey metrics, a holistic analysis is facilitated to extract insights into the participant’s stress levels and behaviors. 

In the combined dataset the participant's sleep patterns and heart rate data indicate a high variability across a range of hours and can be analyzed to infer patterns of physiological and behavioral arousal to assess stress levels. The participant's sleep duration was  a range of  six to seven hours, and normal to  high sleep disturbances.

The participant's heart rate data show a range of correlations and Z-scores with the value of the metric and the population mean and standard deviation for the given population, the analysis can help infer the physiological stress the participant experiences and behaviors that facilitate stress levels.

The wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics indicate an elevated heart rate during the late evening hours around 9-10 pm, indicating heightened physiological arousal. The participant's daily activity levels also suggest moderate engagement in recreational activities such as watching TV and socializing with friends. The self-reported surveys indicate low to moderate stress levels. The participant's overall perceived stress levels as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale are correlated with sleep and heart rate variability and daily activity engagement.

Overall the holistic analysis suggests the participant's stress levels are around the bottom 50th percentile of the population distribution.

The aggregate hourly heart rate data shows a normal cardiovascular pattern with values representing typical daily variation of the participant’s heart rate at rest. However, this data also reflects significant deviation of the heart rate from the average (Aggregated values show that when the heart rate is relatively low,there is a spike in heart rate when its high and the value is high indicating stress or excitement).

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores suggest they are not highly stressed but are experiencing average stress levels. The STAI and trait anxiety scales indicate that they are anxious. They are also experiencing depressive symptoms. Their Z-Score for the PSS is -0.11 which indicates they are experiencing lower stress than their peers. Their Z-score for the PSS is -0.7 which places them in the bottom half in the population distribution of the population of the distribution.

The sleep patterns as recorded by the wearable indicate inconsistent sleep patterns which are suggestive of stress. The Sleep duration varies significantly and is recorded at 7 hours and 50 minutes. This may be indicative of stress. They tend to have an irregular circadian rhythm, physiological rhythm. The MESOR analysis derived from Heart Rate Data are, and amplitude is  and are not parametric. Non parametric measures such interdaily stability and intraday variability indicate of a circadian rhythm across the entire recording period does exist.

The sleep patterns are characterized by high deviation of the mean sleep duration and sleep statistics. The participant sleeps are recorded by the wearable and self reported sleep metrics to have sleep disturbance, an irregular sleep cycle of going to bed late and waking up late and are usually sedentary and is associated with stress.

The daily activities show a relationship to stress levels in that the participant partakes in daily recreational activities such as internet usage, watching videos or movies, listening to music and sedentary hobbies and partakes in substence usage. An examination of heart rate data shows evidence that stress is associated with heart rate variability with daily stress peaks and fluctuations between 6:00 am -12:00 pm with evidence to suggest stress impacting sleep and all circadian rhythm activites. Based on these results, the participant would likely fall into the bottom half of the distribution with regards to their PSS score.

The participant engages in moderate physical activities. For instance they excercise three or more times a week. This may be an attempt to cope with the perceived stress levels. This regular excercise may help to mantain healthy stress levels. Their self esteem is lower than their peers as indicated by the Z-score for self esteem. The heart rate metrics show evidence that the participant has regular stress levels and they tend to be calmer in the morning.

Also, the Fitbit data are included to accompany these metrics to help analyze behavioral patterns such that sleep is at a normal duration and sleep patterns are within the population parameters and only exceptions are time of low heart rate.

Overall considering the multimodal data analysis including behavioral patterns and physiological metrics, the participant's perceived stress level as measured by the PSS seems to be at a relatively low level as the participant experiences relatively stable physiological patterns and behavioral habits that are considered relatively normal and do not suggest extreme stress levels. 

The correlations between values and the PSS score are also considered to interpret the data.

The relationship between self-reported survey scores and wearable metrics appears to be meaningful, given correlations between certain metrics. Given that the the participant's the data includes self-report surveys and wearable-derived metrics, including sleep statistics, meaningful correlations can be inferred. The participant's sleep metrics indicate a relatively normal sleep duration, with a relatively consistent sleep start time, yet the self-reporting of sleep experience suggests the sleep experience may be more complex than what is captured by the wearable metrics alone, with Z-scores indicating individual values relative to the study population. 

The participant's sleep statistics from the wearable Fitbit data indicate relatively normal sleep patterns, yet the self-reported metrics suggest a notable deviation in sleep experience, and a considerable variation from the mean sleep patterns, with Z-scores indicating the participant’s sleep experience may not be entirely normal. The deviation in sleep metrics such as sleep timing and duration would be expected given the lifestyle and lifestyle reported behaviors. However, with a resting heart rate Z-score indicating a relatively low value, and a significant correlation with the PSS score would support an inference of relatively elevated stress from the physiological signals.

The wearable data metrics, particularly the sleep statistics and heart rate variability, give an insight into patterns of stress and daily rhythms. The deviations of the mean heart rate from the mesor and daily variation in the participant’s sleep patterns, suggest a considerable amount of stress on the lower end of the stress spectrum. Given the the participant’s data from wearable-derived metrics and self-report survey responses, the overall analysis suggests that the participant likely exhibits normal stress levels. Given correlations between the PSS domains and the daily metrics of the wearable devices indicate, significant correlations can inform inferences about perceived stress, the overall assessment is suggestive of low to moderate stress levels. The participant’s data suggests that they would be classified into the ""bottom_50"" category. 

The participant’s wearable metrics indicate a relatively normal sleep schedule, with 7 hours of sleep duration and consistent sleep timing. The Z-score indicates that their sleep is relatively normal compared to the study population, and the Z-score indicates that their sleep experience is relatively normal. However, given the Z-scores for certain metrics and PSS correlations, this might suggest that sleep experience may influence overall well-being and therefore PSS correlations.

Looking at heart rate variability, there is considerable individual variation and daily rhythmicity stability. The circadian rhthym metric features, including parametric and non-parametric measures show regularity and structure in the participant’s physiological signals. For the hourly heart rate data, given that this data is aggregated and thus not specific to individual dates, the values represent typical physiological patterns by time of day. These values represent typical cardiovascular responses to daily activities. Given the significant correlations with PSS score are critical to interpret overall patterns and stress levels.

The correlations table suggests that a low or median PSS score is correlated with shorter sleep duration and later sleep timing. Thus given this participant’s data it appears that there is evidence for low stress behaviors and higher stress behaviors are associated with poor sleep and low heart rate activity.

From the given dataset and considering population norms and population averages, the participants Heart Rate variability across the day and night sleep patterns show deviation from what is considered normal for this age and age group. The circadian rhythm metrics show high levels of intra-daily variability and very regular sleep patterns at low to moderate levels.

The wearable Fitbit-derived metrics show that the participant has a relatively stable sleep pattern, with an average sleep duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes`(-1.0 Z-score)` and relatively low levels of intra-daily sleep variability (`0.29 Z-score`). The participant’s sleep start time is also relatively consistent, with a median sleep start time of `01:28:30` and low levels of sleep start time variability (`-0.75 Z-score`). These metrics suggest that the participant has a relatively regular and consistent sleep schedule.

The hourly heart rate data show moderate levels of heart rate variability across the day, with higher heart rates during the late evening and early morning hours. The participant’s resting heart rate is `64.3` beats per minute (`0.73 Z-score`), which is relatively low compared to the population mean. The heart rate variability metrics suggest that the participant may experience moderate levels of physiological arousal and stress during the day.



The self-reported survey data reveal a mix of psychological traits and behavioral patterns. The participant’s scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) suggest low to moderate levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. The participant’s self-esteem score is relatively high (`40.0`), and their happiness score is relatively low (`3.0`). These metrics suggest that the participant may experience moderate levels of stress and anxiety, and may have a relatively positive self-image.



Considering the correlations between the values and the PSS score, the participant’s PSS score is likely to be at the bottom 50% of the population distribution. The correlations between the participant’s survey scores and the PSS score suggest that the participant may experience moderate levels of stress and anxiety, and may have a relatively positive self-image.

 Multimodal Behavioral and Physiological Analysis
Generate clear and structured analysis in formal prose paragraphs.


The participant’s data presents a picture of an individual with a relatively low level of perceived stress. The PSS domains indicate a score that is lower than the mean of the study population. Self-report survey scores reveal that this participant does not exhibit depressive symptoms (CESD score: 14.0) and has a low level of anxiety (STAI score: 45.0). The participant also reports a moderate level of self-esteem (Score:   40.0) and a relatively high level of happiness (Current:   4.0). Lifestyle behaviors such as substance usage, exercise, and daily recreation habits also suggest a participant with a healthy and balanced lifestyle.


Physiological and behavioral metrics derived from wearable Fitbits also support this picture. The participant’s sleep statistics show a median sleep duration of '6 hours 49 minutes' which is slightly below the average sleep duration. The sleep duration standard deviation is '151 minutes' which indicates some variability in sleep patterns. The median sleep start time is '01:28:09' and the sleep start time standard deviation is '80 minutes' which suggests a relatively consistent sleep schedule. Heart rate data shows a resting heart rate of   56.9 beats per minute which is within the normal range. The mean aggregate deviation from mesor for each hour of the day suggests a relatively stable heart rate pattern.


Circadian rhythm metrics derived from heart rate data also indicate a regular and structured circadian rhythm. The parametric measures such as mesor, amplitude and acrophase suggest a typical circadian rhythm pattern. Non-parametric measures such as interdaily stability and intraday variability also indicate a relatively stable and consistent circadian rhythm.


Overall Ranking of PSS Score
Based on the analysis of the participant’s data, it appears that their perceived stress level is on the lower end of the distribution. The participant’s self-reported survey scores and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics all suggest a participant with a relatively low level of perceived stress. The participant’s lifestyle behaviors such as substance usage, exercise and daily recreation habits also support this picture.

Wearable metrics of circadian rhythm show the participant having a moderate sleep schedule and daily routines in the analysis sleep variation indicate regular sleep in the morning with variations and standard deviations in Z-scores can also be seen as low sleep stress.

Furthermore, the daily recreation habits show a relatively high engagement in sedentary activities such as watching TV or videos or listening to music at a duration of 16-30 minutes and moderate engagement in socializing with friends at a duration of 1-2 hours. However the participant does not engage in activities such as video games or reading. The relation value of watching TV or videos was 04  and socializing was 06. The overall analysis indicates that participant might not have a Z-score value of more than 21 and relatively lower sleep stress and anxiety levels in the participant. The participant's heart rate data show a moderate level of physiological arousal with an average heart rate of 68.26 beats per minute and a resting heart rate of 56.0 beats per minute. The participant's engagement in physical activities and daily habits does not seem to be related to high stress levels given the moderate correlation values with stress-related metrics. 

Overall, given participant’s self-reported stress metric values show relatively average stress level and sleep pattern with moderate sleep and wakefulness and participant’s daily habits show engagement in physical activities and sedentary activities but participant does not seem to be engaged in activities such as video games or reading. The wearable metrics indicate a moderate sleep schedule and daily routines. The participant’s heart rate data show moderate physiological arousal and the daily recreation habits show relatively high engagement in sedentary activities and moderate engagement in socializing. The correlation between daily habits and stress metrics are low and moderate and participant does not seem to have high stress given the moderate and relatively low stress metric values and correlation values and daily habits engagement and sleep patterns.

Given participant’s self-reported data and wearable metrics show average stress levels and engagement in daily habits and moderate physiological arousal. Given data show participant does not seem to have stress levels higher than the average stress level of population distribution which can be classified in the bottom 50% of the population distribution.
The final analysis concludes that participant likely has a PSS score in the bottom 50% of the distribution.

88882,18.0,0.10880829015544041,"The participant's self-reported data, a combination of psychological and lifestyle traits, traits and behaviors, and physiological and physiological metrics.  can be described as follows.

Firstly, the 'CombinedInput' contains self-report survey data (CombinedInput) for the participant, self-reporting their traits, a simple set of psychological attributes traits and behaviors. the 'CombinedInput' contains a simple set of survey questions and survey instruments assessing psychological traits and lifestyle behaviors, and mental health symptoms. The participant's self-reported sleep metrics are included in the 'Sleep Statistics' section to accompany wearable recorded recorded metrics to indicate the subjective experience. The metrics are included to provide information not measurable via wearables, to indicate the subjective experience of the participant. The participant's PSS (Perceived Stress) can also be evaluated relative to the population distribution.

An initial holistic overview indicates the participant's sleep. The participant sleeps relatively normally with recorded and Fitbit recorded sleep patterns showing a consistent sleep schedule, sleep quality not self-reported in the surveys but shown through the wearable recorded data. Participant's self-reported sleep is '5 hours 57 minutes' and a sleep schedule with minimal variation given 'Sleep Start Time Standard Deviation' value. The sleep quality can be evaluated via the wearable recorded data where 'Median Sleep Duration' value indicates the amount of time spent sleeping. 

Daily rhythms are shown through the 'Circadian Rhythm Metrics'. Participant's circadian rhythms indicate regular patterns of activity levels through non-parametric measures (e.g. interdaily stability) reflecting the participant’s heart rate consistency. Interpreting these metrics is reflective of regularity and structure in participant’s circadian rhythm throughout the study period. 

In regards to 'Aggregated Hourly Heart Rate Data', hourly deviations in the participant’s heart rate from their resting heart rate  are used to infer patterns of physiological arousal and activity by the time of day. A typical pattern is noticed with more deviations from resting rates at evening hours and closer to resting rates at morning hours. 

Participant self-reported behaviors are included as lifestyle and habits. Participant engages in regular exercise shown through 'Exercised Alone' with 'Three times a week or more', but minimal engagement with others given 'Exercised with Others' '1-2 times a week'. The participant's sports engagement is minimal given 'Sports' '1-2 times a month'. Participant does not engage in reading and sedentary hobbies as 'Reading' 'Do not do' and 'Sedentary Hobby' 'Do not do'. Time spent listening to music is '1-2 hours', and time spent socializing with friends is '31 minutes an hour'. Internet usage is '31 minutes an hour', and watching 'TV/Videos/Movies' time is '15 minutes or less'. 

Scores and classifications are presented alongside correlations to PSS (Perceived Stress Scale) score to aid in interpretation. Participant’s PSS domains should be assessed relative to their population distribution, given correlations between self-report survey scores (e.g. STAI) and wearable metrics. 

With the evidence from 'Self-Reported Surveys' given 'CESD' (Score: 2.0) classification is 'Not depressed', 'STAI' (Score: 28.0) classification is 'not anxious'. 'SelfEsteem' (Score: 46.0) shows the participant has above-average self-esteem as indicated by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Participant reports 'Happy' (Current:	5.0) showing above-average happiness with a 'Trust' (Score:	3.67) indicating relatively high trust of other people given the 'Trust' metrics alongside the 'Happy' metrics. 

A 'Health Satisfaction' (Score:	5.0) indicates participant is satisfied with their physical health given the 'Health Satisfaction' metrics. 'GPA' (e.g.	2015 Fall GPA:	3.93) reflects participant’s academic performance. Participant has a relatively average 'Body Mass Index' value. 

Daily recreation habits and activities as well as substance usage can indicate the participant's perceived stress levels given the correlations between the values and the PSS score. Participant has reported 'Substance Usage' '1-2 times a week' and 'Wine or Liquor' '1-2 times a month' as minimal engagement with 'Recreational Drugs' and 'Non-prescribed Drugs' not at all.

Given these insights, one can evaluate if the participant's overall perceived stress level is high or relatively low. Assessing whether the participant's PSS score places them in the top or bottom 50% of the distribution is possible through the 'Population PSS' (Mean:	21.62, Standard Deviation:	3.68) metrics.

Considering the participant's traits and behaviors, a holistic analysis indicates a classification of the participant's stress level relative to the population distribution. Given the evidence from self-report surveys and wearable metrics alongside correlations to PSS score. 

Therefore, the participant is more likely to have a stress level that places them in the bottom 50% of the study population distribution given the evidence of regular sleep patterns and relatively average self-esteem scores alongside minimal engagement with substances. The participant engages regularly in exercise alone and reports above-average happiness and trust in others which alongside with the evidence of regular circadian rhythms and a healthy body mass index can indicate relatively low stress levels.

93002,22.0,0.5880829015544041,"The participant's data presents a complex picture of psychological and behavioral patterns. The participant's self-reported sleep metrics and wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate a relatively stable sleep pattern, with a median sleep duration of 6 hours and a sleep start time of 11:16 PM. The participant's self-reported sleep metrics are accompanied by a low Z-scored value of -0.51, indicating a lower subjective sleep quality. This suggests the participant experiences some level of distress or sleep disturbance,The participant's self-reported sleep metrics, as accompanied by a Fitbit-recorded value of -0.93, a low Z-score in the wearable sleep metrics,.The participant's self-reported sleep metrics show an inconsistency in subjective experience,which is significant to feelings of daytime tiredness often discussed. 

On examining the hourly heart rate data, some variability patterns emerge as both changes across sleep that, The participant’s resting heart rate of 48 beats per minute was substantially higher as indicated by a z-score of -0.41, population Z-scored value of -0.23 indicating relatively normal cardiovascular arousal level by time of day.

The participant's self-reported sleep metrics and wearable-derived sleep statistics indicate a relatively stable sleep pattern, a median duration of 6 hours and 28 minutes, a sleep start time of 11:16 PM. The participant's self-reported sleep metrics are accompanied by a low Z-scored value of -0.88, indicating a relatively stable sleep quality. 

The participant's heart rate data shows a relatively normal cardiovascular arousal level by time of day, with a resting heart rate of 48 beats per minute, as indicated by a Z-score of -1.18. The participant's mean aggregate deviation from the mesor, indicating a relatively stable heart rhythm across daytime hours. 

The participant's self-reported survey metrics,,, the CES-D score of 14.0, and the STAI score of 40.0,, indicate a moderate level of depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness,. The participant's self-esteem score of 32.0 and the Z-score of -0.87 indicate a relatively low self-esteem. 

The participant's lifestyle behaviors, as indicated by the activities and daily recreation habits, a relatively low level of physical activity and a high level of screen time. 

Given the participant's data, the correlations between the values and the PSS score are relatively low and do not indicate a strong relationship between the participant's behaviors and perceived stress level. 

Considering the participant's data as a whole, the participant's sleep pattern, and self-reported sleep quality are relatively stable and the participant's heart rhythm across daytime hours is relatively normal. The participant's self-reported survey metrics indicate a moderate level of depressive symptoms and anxiety proneness and a relatively low self-esteem. The participant's lifestyle behaviors indicate a relatively low level of physical activity and a high level of screen time. 

Therefore, the participant's overall perceived stress level, as measured by the PSS domains, would likely place them at the bottom half of the study population distribution.

The final conclusion is: 
{""pss_group"": ""bottom_50""}"
30453,23.0,0.7046632124352331,"The participant's data reveals a complex interplay of self-reported traits, behavioral habits, and wearable-derived behavioral and physiological metrics. The participant's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score is not explicitly provided, but the analysis will guide interpretation of perceived stress.

The participant's self-reported sleep metrics indicate a median sleep duration of 6.25 hours (6 hours 15 minutes to 7 hours), and 6.25 hours of sleep (22.5 to 7.25 hours). The wearable Fitbit data suggests a median sleep start time,7:00 AM. The sleep-wake-up time is around 7:00 AM, and sleep-wake-up is 6:30-7:00-8:00:00:00: most of these survey scores and wearable metrics are accompanying statistics regarding: the Z-Score of the metric relative to the study population.

The participant's Self-Reported Activities and Lifestyle survey data indicate the following key points. The Z-score for depressive symptoms is 1.84. The Z-score for sleep quality was -96. The participant has reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Sleep statistics show a relatively stable pattern of sleep-wake up and sleep quality is correlated with perceived stress and sleep quality. The average sleep duration is around 6 hours, and sleep start time ranges from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM. 

In terms of physiological and behavioral data, the wearable metrics reveal regular patterns of sleep, circadian rhythms, and daily variation. For instance, seeing their total daily sleep duration is approximately 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM  in the morning, in comparison to when heart rate peaks, generally around 3-7:00 AM. It can be inferred the participant experiences stress in their sleep-wake, phenomen. The paticular stability metric reveals daily rhythms in the participant’s heart rate. More variability occurs when they sleep during the 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM morning, around 6:00-10:00 AM. 

The participant's self-esteem survey indicates the lowest Z-Score of -1.57, with a Z-score of -2.17, and a correlation with stress value of -0.15: indicating chronic stress of depression. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale shows -0.84, for self-esteem indicating relatively higher self-esteem of 0.34. 

We are looking at daily rhythms that shows -0.62 Z-Score. 

The participant’s sleep duration and start time show irregular sleep patterns of sleep ranging from 10:00 PM 19:00-6:00 AM. They reported sleep quality to be “ Poor”, suggesting they have trouble falling asleep during the night, trouble falling asleep after midnight and waking during the 5:00-10:00 AM morning to  ” sun-rise ”. 

Given the participant’s sleep duration and reported stress,7:00 AM - 11:00 PM,11:00 AM - 7:00 PM of the day, the daily variation of sleep ranges from 6 to 9.

The analysis of wearable-derived data indicates that the participant exhibits a relatively low sleep duration, and high sleep variability. The participant's sleep start time ranges from around 12:47 AM to 8:00 PM. The standard deviation of sleep is relatively high, and their sleep pattern indicates that they have a disturbed sleep-wake, anlow of-0.96, in the standard normal distribution of the study population). The participant's self-reported sleep quality, and sleep-wake-up-time are not available in the provided dataset, but the participant's Z-scored value of sleep duration (0.4) is -1.96, and the mean of-0.96.

71193,25.0,0.8886010362694301,"The participant's data reveals a complex interplay of psychological and physiological metrics, highligting to a perceived stress level that is simultaneously impacted by factors such as daily variation in heart rate and self-reported metrics as sleep metrics. When analyzing the combined metrics of sleep patterns, as captured by the wearable device, show a relatively normal circadian rhythm as indicated by a median of 9 hours and 15 minutes, a relatively stable sleep start time as well as a metric derived from wearable device sleep statistics that correspond to normal relatively early sleep schedule. Here, we note a more variable sleep duration but with relatively normal sleep statistic stability as a function of Z-score at the population distribution. 

In the analysis of combined self-report survey data of CombinedInput section, there are a few salient behavioral and lifestyle metrics and correlations, where a higher or a lower Z-score, that indicates the value of a behavioral or psychological metric, such as a Z-score value, are given the value of a metric relative to the study population,.Here are some insights derived by doing a deeper analyis,.a stresssed behavioral metric perspective,.

14279,20.0,0.3160621761658031,"The participant's data suggests a range of psychological and behavioral metrics. Self-reported surveys indicate the participant's subjective experience, providing metrics not measurable via wearables. The participant's perceived stress (as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale or the Stress the PSS) would likely place them in the lower half or upper half of the distribution of stress in terms of stress.

For this analysis, a holistic analysis will yield insights into the behavioral and physiological state of the participant's. The analysis will be presented as structured prose.

The participant’s data suggests a number of significant correlations between behavioral, physiological metrics and self-reported stress metrics. Some significant values include sleep statistics and circadian rhythm metrics which all seem related to the stress values from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores. Given correlations and significant trends the, correlations suggest that this individual has an overall perceived stress score at the lower half of the population’s distribution.


In accordance with psychological data and perceived stress as indicated in the given dataset of the participant, one would likely rank at the bottom 50% for their PSS score
